The faster easing of lockdown measures and a ""more rapid"" pick-up in consumer spending meant the economy rebounded earlier than it had assumed in May.  Spending on clothing and household goods were back to pre-Covid levels.  However, the Bank warned of a ""material"" rise in unemployment this year as it held interest rates at 0.1%.  Governor Andrew Bailey said recent data suggested the recovery in consumer spending was gaining traction, while spending on food and energy bills remained above pre-Covid levels.  He said: ""We have had a strong recovery in the last few months. The pace puts the economy ahead of where we thought it would be in May.""  However, Mr Bailey cautioned against reading too much into recent data: ""We don't think the recent past is necessarily a good guide to the immediate future,"" he said.  The Bank said spending on leisure and entertainment, which accounts for a fifth of all consumer spending, remained subdued.  Business investment was also weak, which would weigh on the recovery.  Slower recovery  The Bank expects the UK economy to shrink by 9.5% this year.  While this would be the biggest annual decline in 100 years, it is not as steep as its initial estimate of a 14% contraction.  The Bank said the UK still faced its sharpest recession on record, with the outlook for growth now ""unusually uncertain"".  Mr Bailey said it was the ""largest quantum of uncertainty in a forecast"" that policymakers had ever published.  The Bank expects the UK economy to grow by 9% in 2021, and 3.5% in 2022, with the economy forecast to get back to its pre-Covid size at the end of 2021.  This compares with growth estimates of 15% and 3% respectively, in a scenario the Bank set out in May.  Unemployment is expected to almost double from the current rate of 3.9% to 7.5% by the end of the year as government-funded support schemes come to an end.  Average earnings are also expected to shrink for the first time since the financial crisis.  The Bank said more workers faced a pay cut or freeze in 2020, adding: ""In many cases, bonuses have been scaled back or withdrawn altogether for this year.""  Its latest forecasts are based on the assumption that there is no second wave of the virus and that there is a smooth transition to a new EU free trade agreement at the start of 2021.  More than nine million jobs have been furloughed under the government's job retention scheme, but the Bank expects most of those furloughed to go back to work as the economy recovers.  Unions have urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend the scheme beyond October to avoid mass job losses. However, Mr Bailey told the BBC it was right to focus on helping people to find new jobs.  ""It's been a very successful scheme, but he's right to say we have to look forward now,"" he said.  Meanwhile, a fall in energy prices and the temporary VAT cut for hotels, theme parks and other hospitality businesses means the cost of living is expected to barely rise this year.  The Bank expects inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), to fall close to zero by the end of 2020, before gradually rising back to its target of 2%.  Negative rates 'under review'  The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would not even think about raising interest rates until there was ""clear evidence"" the recovery had taken hold.  Mr Bailey also signalled that policymakers were against using negative interest rates any time soon, adding that such a move may have unintended consequences.  It could stop the UK's already fragile banks from lending, or lead to customers withdrawing their money and holding it in cash.  Policymakers also noted that High Street banks would find it difficult to cut savings rates below zero.  ""They are part of our toolbox,"" said Mr Bailey. ""But at the moment we do not have a plan to use them.""  Image copyright Getty Images  He said the public may find the policy difficult to understand. ""There would be a lot of explaining to do on what this means, why we're doing it, and what the benefits would be.""  Ruth Gregory, an economist at Capital Economics, said the Bank was likely to increase its money printing programme by a further Â£100bn later this year.  She also expects the Bank to keep interest rates at 0.1% ""or below"" for ""at least five years"".  Are banks passing rate cuts on?  Millions of households that already had a variable-rate mortgage have benefitted from recent interest rate cuts.  However, the Bank said borrowing had become more expensive over the past six months for first-time buyers and others moving up the property ladder, particularly for people with small deposits.  Banks also continued to reduce rates on savings accounts. The average instant-access savings account now pays 0.1% annual interest, compared with 0.4% in February.  Lenders said they were restricting credit due to the uncertain economic outlook.  One in six mortgages in the UK is currently subject to a payment holiday because of the pandemic.  The economic damage may have been been less catastrophic than feared in recent months, but the Bank thinks the scars will remain for longer, both to activity and jobs.  The Bank believes it will take the economy until the end of 2021 to get back to pre-crisis activity. Crucially it admits the risks are to the downside - not least as it assumes that the health risks from the virus and restrictions gradually recede, with no significant resumption of a widespread lockdown. That could prove a serious setback.  What then? The key to our recovery is consumer spending - and the interest rates that might shape that are at record lows already. Could we be heading into the uncharted territory of negative rates, where savers are effectively charged to deposit cash? It seems unlikely. The Bank has been taking a closer look at that tool and concludes it could be ""less effective ...to stimulate the economy"".  It does have other tools - the Bank has supported cashflow across the economy by pumping funds into financial markets via quantitative easing and participating in some loan schemes.  But it may have to rely increasingly on the chancellor to give the economy emergency aid in the event of further trouble.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53675467,http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml,ad8ba8cb9df0afbfefe2029987919988b464bcd3843189292cbbb7c6ccbe5769,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Christian B, a 43-year-old man currently in prison in Germany, is appealing against his conviction for raping an American woman in 2005.  The attack took place in Praia de Luz, Portugal - the same area where three-year-old Madeleine disappeared in 2007.  His appeal hinges on a legal point relating to his extradition to Germany.  Suspects' surnames are not usually revealed in Germany for privacy reasons.  Christian B's legal team has challenged the European arrest warrant issued over the 2005 rape charge.  He was extradited from Italy to Germany two years ago on drug trafficking charges, and later convicted of the rape of the 72-year-old American woman and sentenced to seven years in prison.  The German court handling the appeal sought guidance from the Luxembourg-based European Court of Justice (ECJ), which gave a non-binding opinion that German authorities did not have to get permission from Portugal for the rape charge. Italy agreed he could be tried on the rape charge.  Advocate General Michal Bobek said the appeal did not appear valid because Christian B left Germany voluntarily after his first extradition from Portugal, so Portuguese authorities have no role to play.  The final judgement will be made by ECJ judges at a later date.  If that appeal is successful, Christian B could go free next year, at the end of his jail term for the drug offence. He has not been convicted of any crime related to Madeleine McCann.  Christian B was revealed as the main suspect in the case in June, as German and UK police made a fresh appeal for information about Madeleine's disappearance.  He is believed to have been in the area where Madeleine was last seen while on holiday in the Algarve in Portugal.  Police said he was regularly living in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007 and had jobs in the area, including in catering, but also committed burglaries in hotels and dealt drugs.  Image copyright PA Image caption Madeleine McCann was three years old when she went missing in 2007  German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the Madeleine investigation, has previously said prosecutors have evidence that leads them to believe Christian B killed her, but it is not strong enough to take him to court.  After the appeal he said: ""Ultimately, we cannot influence the decision because it is not related to the McCann investigation.  ""This does not affect our investigations, but of course we would like to know where our suspect is.  ""As long as he is in custody, we know this.""  Last month, the Metropolitan Police said the case remained a ""missing persons"" investigation in the UK because there was no ""definitive evidence"" as to whether Madeleine was alive or not.  Also in July, a police search was carried out at an allotment in Hanover which it is understood was rented to Christian B in the year of her disappearance.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53676474,http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml,7f537bd6462788b8b80a370591f0bbb5a5843cef254484081950b35b6f6e9430,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The government says the masks, which use ear-loop fastenings rather than head loops, may not fit tightly enough.  They were bought for healthcare workers from supplier Ayanda Capital as part of a Â£252m contract.  Ayanda says the masks met the specifications the government had set out. The government says its safety standards process is ""robust"".  It has emerged that the person who originally approached the government about the deal was a government trade adviser who also advises the board of Ayanda.  But he told the BBC his position played no part in the awarding of the contract.  Calling for a National Audit Office investigation into the government's ""mishandling of PPE procurement"", Labour MP Rachel Reeves said: ""The latest PPE scandal cannot be swept under the carpet.""  Skip Twitter post by @RachelReevesMP The Conservative Government allowed the PPE stockpile to run down & then bought 50 million unusable masks from an offshore finance company with no history of providing NHS equipment.

Last month Labour called for a National Audit Office investigation into the Governmentâs mishandling of PPE procurement. These mistakes can never happen again. We owe it to all those who care for us. https://t.co/JXyPrSyCMQ â Rachel Reeves (@RachelReevesMP) August 6, 2020 Report  In the early weeks of the pandemic the NHS experienced severe shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE).  The government says it had to find new suppliers quickly to meet demand and to compete with rising global competition.  On 29 April the Department of Health and Social Care signed the Â£252m contract with Ayanda Capital Limited to supply two types of face masks.  The most expensive part of the order consisted of 50 million FFP2 respirator masks, which are designed to protect healthcare workers from inhaling harmful particles.  Image caption The government bought 50 million masks like these with ear loops  According to legal papers seen by the BBC, the government says these masks will now not be used in the NHS because of a safety issue.  The document says that there is concern about whether they would fit adequately.  To be effective these types of face mask need to fit tightly to create a seal between the mask and the wearer's face.  Anyone who wears them for work is required to undergo a face fit test.  ""The face fit is either a pass or a fail and there are more fails on products with ear loops than there are on products with head harnesses,"" says Alan Murray, chief executive of the British Safety Industry Federation.  ""That means that it wouldn't necessarily provide the protection that was required from it.""  It is not clear what will happen now to the 50 million masks.  Ayanda Capital also supplied 150 million Type IIR masks, which the government says are unaffected.  Most have now been delivered but they have not yet been released for use in the NHS and are awaiting further testing.  'Staggering' amounts spent  The information was disclosed in a legal response to the Good Law Project, which is seeking to challenge the government in the courts over three PPE contracts it awarded, including Ayanda Capital's.  The campaign group argues the government's awarding of contracts directly to companies during the pandemic, rather than opening them to competition, may have been unlawful.  ""It's taken this extraordinary sum of public funds and wasted it on PPE that it itself says cannot be released for use in the NHS because it's not safe,"" said Jolyon Maugham, the Good Law Project's director.  ""We do think that it's important that the court take a look at these contracts, that it declare them to be unlawful and that there be full transparency of how these staggering amounts of public money have been spent.""  Government adviser  The government has also disclosed that the original approach to sell the masks came not from Ayanda Capital but from a businessman called Andrew Mills.  His company, Prospermill, had secured the rights to the full production capacity of a large factory in China to produce masks and was able to offer a large quantity almost immediately.  But the legal document seen by the BBC notes that Mr Mills requested the government instead sign the contract for the masks with Ayanda Capital, whose board he advises, because it could arrange overseas payment more quickly.  What do I need to know about the coronavirus?  Mr Mills is also an adviser to the UK Board of Trade.  He told the BBC his position played no part in the award of the contract, which was subject to the same evaluation as all offers made in response to the government's request for help.  Ayanda Capital Limited said: ""The masks supplied went through a rigorous technical assurance programme and meet all the requirements of the technical specifications which were made available online through the government's portal.  ""There are provisions in our contract for product to be rejected if it did not meet the required specification as per the contract. These provisions have not been activated.""  A government statement said: ""Throughout this global pandemic, we have been working tirelessly to deliver PPE to protect people on the frontline.  ""Over 2.4 billion items have been delivered, and more than 30 billion have been ordered from UK-based manufacturers and international partners to provide a continuous supply, which meets the needs of health and social care staff both now and in the future.  ""There is a robust process in place to ensure orders are of high quality and meet strict safety standards, with the necessary due diligence undertaken on all government contracts.""

But Ms Flack's mother Chris said if ""it was an ordinary person, you wouldn't have been bothered"".  Ms Flack was found dead at her home in Stoke Newington, London in February, while she was facing trial accused of assaulting Mr Burton - a charge she denied.

She told officers: ""I admit I did it. I used the phone.""  Based on this evidence the CPS decided to caution Ms Flack for assault, but Scotland Yard urged the CPS to push ahead with a prosecution, the inquest heard.  Det Insp Lauren Bateman told the inquest Ms Flack had not made it clear in a police interview later what she was admitting to.  During the interview, Ms Flack said she had flicked Mr Burton ""to wake him up"", and did not believe she caused his injury.

Det Insp Bateman said a senior lawyer had to make the final decision whether or not a caution was insufficient, and in her opinion a caution for the sort of offence was not in line with guidance.  At the inquest Ms Flack's mother criticised the police decision.  She told Ms Bateman: ""No real evidence was put forward. If it was an ordinary person, you wouldn't have been bothered.

The 28-year-old, who cannot be named, was jailed for at least 17 years after a jury found him guilty of murdering Ms Millane in an Auckland hotel in 2018.  After her death he hid her body in a suitcase and buried her in bushland.  His appeal is based around elements of the trial process as well as the length of the minimum non-parole period.  At his trial last year, the killer claimed Ms Millane, who was last seen on the night before her 22nd birthday, had died accidentally, after the pair engaged in rough sex that went too far.  But a jury in November rejected that argument and found him guilty of murder.  New Zealand media outlet Stuff said the appeal was based around how much emphasis was placed on the element of consent, expert evidence, probability, and the negative evidence given by other women about his character.  Ms Millane, from Wickford, Essex, met her killer on dating app Tinder while travelling in Auckland in December 2018.  The trial heard the pair spent the evening drinking before returning to the man's room in the CityLife hotel in central Auckland where he killed her.  He then disposed of her body by burying it in a suitcase in the WaitÄkere Ranges, a mountainous area outside the city.  After he was sentenced in February, Ms Millane's mother Gillian told the killer she was ""absolutely heartbroken that you have taken my daughter's future and robbed us of so many memories that we were going to create"".  Defence lawyer Rachael Reed QC reportedly told the appeal hearing: ""I do not in any way seek to condone or excuse his actions after Miss Millane's death. I cannot and will not do so - they are inexcusable.""  But according to the New Zealand Herald, she argued the jury should have had more direction around consent issues and ""more balanced"" direction on the expert evidence, and said the sentence was ""manifestly unjust"".

The Financial Conduct Authority found borrowers were getting into financial trouble after taking on extra credit.  Lenders are accused of poor practice by using online accounts and apps to encourage consumers to borrow more.  ""Repeat borrowing could be a strong indicator of levels of debt that are harmful to the customer,"" the FCA said.  It reported firms using images of exotic locations to suggest consumers take on extra borrowing to have a holiday.  Some use ""nudge"" techniques such as appealing to social norms by suggesting that relending is common practice and normal behaviour.  Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform AJ Bell, said: ""As a large chunk of the population has been forced into debt by the current Covid-19 crisis, the regulator is clearly worried about debt companies using misleading marketing and pushy tactics to keep customers in high-cost debt.""  Debt adviser Sara Williams, who writes the Debt Camel blog, said it was good that the FCA had recognised the harm caused by repeat lending.  ""If you have had to take a high-cost loan, you are often left short of money and are then vulnerable to marketing offering you another loan as being 'easy' and 'convenient', but this traps people in expensive debt for much longer,"" she said.  Juggling repayments  High-cost credit customers are more likely to be vulnerable, have low financial resilience and poor credit histories, the watchdog said in its review.  They often have several debts forcing them to juggle repayments, sometimes having to prioritise which debts to pay when they do not have enough money for all.  But lenders target vulnerable borrowers with marketing messages which emphasise the ease, convenience and benefits of taking more credit.  The FCA said it was concerned that lenders were not balancing their marketing messages with warnings about the risks of people taking on more debt than they could afford.  ""Before the pandemic we saw increasing numbers of complaints about high-cost lenders' relending practices, which showed that firms had failed to adequately assess affordability, and they were not relending in a way that was sustainable for customers,"" said Jonathan Davidson, executive director of supervision, retail and authorisations at the FCA.  The watchdog said lenders should assess whether further borrowing is in the customer's best interests.  ""Rigorous affordability assessments are key to avoiding harm in this area, and firms should ensure they are making proportionate and responsible assessments of the sustainability of borrowing,"" it said.  Coronavirus pressures  Looking ahead, the FCA said it had been forced to act to help consumers who were under additional financial pressure due to the impact of coronavirus.  It has encouraged firms to offer payment deferrals to help struggling borrowers.  ""We are closely engaged with firms to understand the impacts of the pandemic on consumers,"" said Mr Davidson.  ""Where consumers are experiencing payment difficulties, we encourage them to contact their credit provider as soon as possible and explain their situation and get the help that lenders have agreed to provide.""  Laura Suter warned that during the pandemic more people had been using payday loans or doorstep lending either to pay their normal bills or to pay off other debt.  ""That becomes a very slippery slope that's tough to get out of,"" she said. ""Any crackdown on these practices would be good news for consumers at a time when many find themselves in spiralling debt.  ""This is particularly the case as the Covid-19 measures introduced by the regulator to ease the burden of debt, such as payment holidays or reductions in interest rates, start to be unwound and people face hefty bills for their borrowing.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53677876,http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml,e77ec76fa2d490822b7aa3dd69c6c6c0d8ef55461f4995344ac127183171a343,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Robert Jenrick said local people would not be able to block developments in designated ""growth"" zones.  The changes were needed to speed up the planning process, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  But critics say they could lead to ""bad-quality housing"" and loss of local control over development.  The government says it wants reduce the number of planning cases that get overturned at appeal by creating a ""clearer, rules-based system"".  Mr Jenrick told Today local people would get a ""meaningful say"" at the start of the planning process, when local plans are drawn up, but will not be able to block new schemes after that.  He claimed local people ""did not have a great deal of influence"" over the current planning system and that few people engaged with it.  He told BBC Breakfast: ""We have a major housing challenge but also a major economic challenge and a lot of people's jobs depend on this industry.  ""We think our new system will still be democratic, it will still have local engagement, but it will be much faster and help us to meet the needs of the next generation.""  'Slum housing'  Mr Jenrick also wants to change the way developers contribute to the cost of building affordable housing in every new project.  The government will introduce a national charge for developers - replacing the existing Section 106 agreements and the Community Infrastructure Levy - to fund projects such as schools, roads and GP surgeries, and a fixed proportion of affordable homes in a development.  Labour's shadow housing minister Mike Amesbury said: ""This is a developer's charter that will see communities sidelined in decisions and denied vital funding for building schools, clinics and community infrastructure.""  Alan Jones, President of the Royal Institute of British Architects said: ""While there's no doubt the planning system needs reform, these shameful proposals do almost nothing to guarantee the delivery of affordable, well-designed and sustainable homes.""  He said that taken together with moves to allow more commercial premises to be converted into homes without planning permission, ""there's every chance they could also lead to the creation of the next generation of slum housing"".  Mr Jenrick said such criticism was ""complete nonsense"", insisting that ""design and quality"" were central to the government's plans.  Planning rows raise high passions.  For Jacky Nabb, a proposal to build 3,000 houses near her home in the Oxfordshire countryside felt to her like ""somebody just twisted my stomach"".  She added: ""It sounds really dramatic, but it broke my heart.""  There has been a four-year battle over the prospective new town at Chalgrove - and a broader plan for local homes - with bitter political skirmishing and the personal intervention of the housing secretary.  But still, not a single brick has been laid here.  Image caption Jacky Nabb is embroiled in a local planning battle  It is exactly this sort of delay ministers want to sweep away.  Under their policy, once a local plan is agreed, developers in some places could press on with confidence.  But local Conservatives have opposed the Chalgrove plan too, just as they have many other developments.  Will the government hold firm should campaigning Tories - under fire from home-owning voters - turn on this policy?  Making yet another announcement about homes is easy. Turning it into real change will require political courage.  Under the government's proposals, which have gone out to consultation, land will be divided into three categories - ""growth"", ""renewal"" or ""protected"".  If land is designated for ""renewal"" councils would have to look favourably on new developments. In ""growth"" areas, new homes, hospitals and schools will be allowed automatically.  Areas of outstanding natural beauty and the green belt will come under the ""protected"" category and ""beautiful buildings"" will be fast-tracked through the system.  The White Paper proposes that all new streets should be tree-lined and ""all new homes to be carbon-neutral by 2050, with no new homes delivered under the new system needing to be retrofitted"".  The plans also include the ""first homes scheme"", to provide newly built homes at a 30% discount for local people, key workers and first-time buyers.  The chairman of the Local Government Association, James Jamieson, said the government's claim that the planning system was a barrier to house building was ""a myth"".  Mr Jamieson said nine out of 10 planning applications were approved by councils, but that more than a million homes given permission in the last decade had yet to be built.  Homeless charity Shelter said 280,000 homes received permission in England between 2011 and 2016 but were never built.  BBC Reality Check said there had been criticism in recent years of the amount of time it took to get planning permission, but also said many developers secured planning permission and then did not immediately build.  How many years does it take to get planning permission for different-sized developments?  It's hard to be sure about these proposals from the environmental perspective because key details are missing.  One policy unifies green critics - the plan to make all homes carbon-neutral by 2050.  Labour promised to achieve that by 2016 and environmentalists condemned the later date as ""pitiful"".  They also fear the zoning system will do little to help the wildlife that lives outside protected areas.  The current system governed by councillors is very flexible. The zoning system would be more rigid.  Apart from that, confusion abounds.  What happens, for instance, if citizens devising their local plan decide their whole area should fall into the ""protected"" category? Can they reject all new homes on their patch?  If so, what's the role of the government's housing targets?  Perhaps answers will emerge. But I'm told some officials in the department think these plans have been rushed and are rather a ""dog's dinner"".  A number of new planning measures were announced by the government in June.  From September, home owners will be allowed to build above their properties without going through the normal planning process and developers will be able build above - or demolish and rebuild - vacant premises, or change the use of town centre shops, without planning permission.  Builders will also be allowed to convert a wider range of commercial properties into homes - despite criticism in a government-commissioned report that the existing policy has led to poor quality, cramped flats with low quality of life for their residents.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53669432,http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml,c1b4af2c54b4de4f8c319052c056c372c9887518570a1bf7ea142cbef3da4a4a,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Former champion John Higgins made the first 147 maximum break at the World Championship since 2012.  Higgins, 45, bumped elbows with opponent Kurt Maflin to celebrate what was his 10th career maximum break but his first at the Crucible.  It was the 11th 147 at the World Championship and the first since fellow Scot Stephen Hendry made the last of his three Crucible maximums.  The break came in the 12th frame of Higgins' second-round match.  With no crowd in the Crucible Theatre because of the coronavirus pandemic, there was no standing ovation or clapping to mark the achievement, while Higgins himself hardly celebrated as he walked off for the mid-session interval trailing the Norwegian 7-5.  The clearance puts the four-time world champion in line for a Â£40,000 bonus for the maximum, as well as the Â£15,000 highest break prize.  ""That was incredible,"" said BBC TV analyst Joe Perry. ""There was nothing else to put on his CV apart from the Crucible 147 and now he's done it.  ""Crowd or no crowd, making a 147 is special because you have to be perfect on every shot.""  Higgins predicted there would be a 147 before the championship and stated that this year's tournament could be the best ever in terms of standard.  He continued to fight back after the interval and levelled the match at 8-8 at the end of the session.  The best-of-25 match plays to a finish at 19:00 BST on Thursday.  Maximums at the World Championship  Higgins joins six other in making a 147 break on the biggest stage of all.

Deprivation of liberty orders are increasingly being used to detain children in homes when suitable accommodation cannot be found.  Campaigners say it shows a ""wilful neglect"" of young people at risk of exploitation.  The government said supporting vulnerable children ""is a priority"".  Deprivation of liberty orders are often used for adults who lack the mental capacity to consent to changes in their care, such as elderly people with Alzheimer's.  But BBC News has learned they are increasingly being used for children and young people on safeguarding grounds.  The orders can cover a range of restrictions from detention in a house to taking away a mobile phone - and are commonly secured from the High Court or Court of Protection by a local authority in charge of the care of the child.  Do you know someone placed on a Deprivation of Liberty order? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk  Freedom of information responses from 91 of 170 local authorities in England and Wales show the number of deprivation of liberty orders for children and young people went from 43 in 2016-17 to 134 in 2018-19. The vast majority of these will be for children in care.  More than a quarter of orders granted over the last five years were made primarily because of concerns about the child or young person going missing, without relating to mental capacity.  'Draconian restrictions'  One recent hearing granted a deprivation of liberty order for a 13-year-old child to be detained in a rented council house while being cared for by four local authority staff.  The order meant the child could be locked in a bedroom at night, stripped of all loose items and restrained if attempting to self-harm, hurt staff or escape.  The judgement acknowledged the restrictions were ""draconian"" but said 30 applications for a place in a secure unit or alternative settings had been declined.  At another hearing, a High Court judge complained of being ""almost drowned out"" by applications at that time and said he was increasingly concerned they were ""operating to bypass"" safeguards provided by secure accommodation.  BBC News has learned a 14-year-old victim of so-called modern day slavery had been placed on a deprivation of liberty order and was moved to an unregulated home.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC News revealed that 14 council investigations have been launched into ""organised and complex abuse"" in unregulated homes  Despite being banned from having a mobile phone because of her vulnerability, the girl told a social worker she was given an iPhone and moved between residences across the UK by a company, sometimes without the local authority being informed.  The number of children waiting for placements in secure accommodation - residences children are prevented from leaving - hit a peak of 54 open referrals in England, according to records released by the Department for Education following a freedom of information request.  'Wilful neglect'  BBC News has learned three children have spent more than six months waiting for a secure accommodation placement, and one child had 27 individual referrals declined.  The lack of appropriate placements for such children and young people is an ""absolute disgrace"", according to Carolyne Willow, director of the charity Article 39, which campaigns for the rights of children in institutional settings.  ""It demonstrates wilful neglect at the highest level and a readiness to permit the decaying of children's services.  ""You don't have to be a child welfare expert to be able to imagine the risks of putting an individual child into accommodation where there's no other childrenâ¦ where everything you do is monitored and supervised, where every aspect of ordinary childhood experiences are taken from you.""  Such orders ""are meant to be last resort measures, they're not meant to be regular, routine ways of protecting children"", she said.  Investment is needed, not only in secure accommodation, but a range of specialised placements that cater to the dangers now faced by vulnerable children, said Jenny Coles, the President of the Association of Directors of Children's Services.  ""The children, young people, that are coming into care over the last three or four years, their needs and their experiences have changed"", she said. ""[These range] from sexual exploitation, criminal exploitation, gangs, county lines.  ""If we had that broader range [of placements], that was meeting complexity, we wouldn't have to potentially use those orders as we have been using them.""  In a statement, a government spokesperson said: ""Supporting the most vulnerable children in the country is a priority for this government, and every young person in care deserves appropriate, safe accommodation that supports them in the best way possible.  ""Local authorities have a duty to make sure there are sufficient places, including secure care, for their looked-after children.  ""We have invested Â£40m in supporting councils in England to improve and expand the secure provision available, and we have consulted on radical reforms to the quality of independent and semi-independent placements to make sure the right checks and balances are in place.""

Howard Green died of dementia and heart failure at the Cae Bryn home in Wrexham at the age of 79 in July 2017.  His wife Nita was unhappy with his care, but the home cleared itself following an internal investigation.  The ombudsman found the care records were missing or incomplete, and said the Greens had suffered ""injustice"".  The home, now part of the Highfield care home, is part of the Pendine Park Care Organisation Ltd, controlled by Care Forum Wales chair Mario Kreft and his wife Gillian.  The care home management said actions had been implemented since Mr Green's death and the home had been given a positive inspection in 2019.  Mr Green, from Ewloe, Flintshire, could not speak after suffering a stroke in 2011 and suffered from vascular dementia, moving into Cae Bryn in May 2017 after a spell in hospital.  His wife had been unhappy with his care and embarked on a quest to recover his care records after his death.

Mrs Green continued to seek answers, and said she ""cried her eyes out"" when she received a solicitor's letter in October 2019, telling her to ""cease to send any further correspondence"" to the home and its staff.  The letter said her complaint had been dealt with and the inquiry had ""conclusively determined no wrongdoing within Pendine Park's organisation"".  Mr Bennett described the move as ""poor practice"", and said he was ""disappointed"" the letter claimed the complaint had been dismissed while he was still investigating the matter.  The probe by the complaints watchdog also found Mr Green's medication had been stopped with ""no explanation"" and ""without a valid reason"" - and medical advice had not been sought in a ""timely manner"" twice during his three-month stay at the home.

She had bought a flat in a new development at Battersea Power Station only last year. The complex included restaurants, spas and bars.  But when all those closed down because of the pandemic, the reality of her environment dawned on her.  ""I spent seven weeks isolated there and realised that I absolutely hated it,"" she told the BBC.  ""When you take away all the amenities that these developments advertise, then you realise you're just living in a glass box.  ""It was a ghost town. It was just very soul-destroying living in this enormous development with no life going on.""  Joanna took swift action to remedy her plight. She moved to the village of Datchworth Green in Hertfordshire, where she now has a five-bedroom house with a garden and a view overlooking a cricket pitch.  ""I've got lots of space and it's fantastic,"" she says.  Although she and her boyfriend are currently working from home, she is still close enough to be able to go back to the office.  ""I can still commute to London, so it makes it more viable if I had to go back to the daily commute, which I don't think I will any time soon,"" she says.  New lifestyle  There has been a surge of interest in moving to the country due to city dwellers' priorities changing during the coronavirus lockdown, estate agents have said.  Across the UK, inquiries about buying a home in a village jumped by 126% in June and July compared with the same period last year, said Rightmove. Estate agent chain Knight Frank reported similar trends.  In some cities, such as Liverpool and Edinburgh, searches more than doubled, Rightmove said.  ""The lure of a new lifestyle, one that is quieter and has an abundance of beautiful countryside and more outdoor space, has led to more city dwellers choosing to become rural residents,"" said Miles Shipside of Rightmove.  ""The most popular village moves are still within the same region the home hunters are currently in, as it's likely they'll keep their current job but may have the flexibility to commute less often and set up their working space at home.""  Money not the motive  Rightmove said the number of inquiries from Liverpool residents looking for a village lifestyle had almost tripled (275%) compared with a year earlier.  In Edinburgh, village inquiries are up 205% and in Birmingham they have increased by 186%.  The website said some urban home owners may have benefited from strong house price growth over the years, making it possible to now trade up and out to the country.  But money does not appear to be the main motive for moving, as average asking prices in villages are often more expensive than in cities.  In many cases, the searches show house hunters are looking at villages within commuting distance to their current city, suggesting people are being drawn to the appeal of a quieter way of life.  Mark Rimell, director in Strutt & Parker's country house department, said: ""A slower pace of life, outdoor space and tight knit communities come hand in hand with village living - something many have come to appreciate in recent months - and have enduring appeal.""  Working from home shift  Rightmove's research was released as a separate survey from Barclays Mortgages found that the South West of England, with its rural and coastal communities, is a particularly desirable location for those currently in Birmingham, Nottingham, London, and Manchester.  Barclays Mortgages found popular reasons for people wanting to relocate include a bigger garden, being closer to essential services, living where they can exercise easily, being nearer to relatives, and a stronger local community.  Dr Peter Brooks, chief behavioural scientist at Barclays, said: ""More outside space and the benefits of being closer to friends and family are high on the 'must have' list for many movers.  ""As working from home becomes more commonplace moving cross-country looks to be more achievable for many as there is less of a need to be within a short commute to the office.""

Image copyright Ministry of Defence  The history of the Last Post  The Last Post was first published in the 1790s and was just one of two dozen or so bugle calls sounded daily in British Army camps to regulate a soldier's day.  It was used to let soldiers know the duty officer had completed his inspection of the sentry-posts and the camp was secure for the night.  But, from the 1850s onwards, it became customary for the regimental bugler to sound the Last Post over the grave of any soldier who died overseas, where often there was no other music available to accompany him on his final journey.  Over time the custom was adopted at home as well as abroad and by the time World War One broke out in 1914 it was routinely played at soldiers' funerals.  The tune - which has gone from 45 seconds to 75 seconds - has also been played at the funerals of political leaders including Gandhi and Nelson Mandela.

David McGowan, of Broughton Brewery in the Borders, said half as many pubs were now selling his beers as they could not afford to stock the range they had previously.  He said it was having a knock-on effect to microbreweries across Scotland.  His warning came as pubs were closed in Aberdeen due to a Covid-19 outbreak.  Mr McGowan, who lives in Edinburgh, said half of the 250 pubs on his books were now not ordering from him.  He said: ""Because of social distancing measures, pubs are not getting the same number of customers into their premises and they also have restricted opening hours.

""Our head brewer, Ian Smith, has been with us for more than 35 years and has specialist skills that mean we can produce our hand-crafted beers.

It said a shortage of information about safe study, accommodation and support was ""concerning"" so close to term.  The government says universities should convey any plans ""clearly"" to students.  But some students fear they may have to shield in bedrooms and have called for more detail on safety measures.  Beth, who asked us not to use her surname, has been shielding due to Crohn's Disease and a hormone deficiency and says she is concerned about the safety of accommodation and the possibility of a second wave.  ""What if I get back to university and then four weeks in I'm asked to shield again and I can no longer access my kitchen or leave my room? My little box room will be all I have to ensure that I'm safe.""  'Further risk to lives'  It is a fear echoed by many students among the 2.2 million people asked to shield by the UK government at the start of lockdown, which ended on 1 August.  But with just weeks before term begins, vulnerable students have said there has been little communication about what they can expect, in part, because universities themselves are grappling with an unprecedented situation.  The University of Surrey said it plans to ""contact all new students"" to see what support it can offer, and will try to meet specific accommodation requirements. But it said it doesn't actually have any plans in place yet.  The NUS said a ""lack of clarity"" from many universities about coronavirus measures was ""concerning"".  Sara Khan, who looks after student equality for the NUS, said: ""Clear support pathways must be outlined for students moving into accommodation safely and accessing mental health services physically or remotely.  ""A failure to put these plans into action will pose further risk to the lives of students, particularly shielding students.""  image copyright Jennifer image caption Jennifer hopes her university will test students regularly  The lack of specific information is something that worries Jennifer who has been shielding for five months due to having the blood disorder Thalysemia, which can lead to complications in the body's organs.  She is about to start a master's degree in terrorism and politics at the University of St Andrews.  Rather than risk living in university accommodation she has decided to pay more for private housing, which she says gives her ""security and certainty"".  ""I'm hoping that the student body will receive regular Covid-19 tests so that people can go safely and without worry to university.""  She said her university life was already impacted by coronavirus before the summer break.  ""I worked twice as hard as I used too, because I couldn't see my lecturers. I think what impacted me most was also not being able to see my friends. I love their presence, their ideas and thoughts.""  image copyright Emma image caption Emma: ""I am hoping the university as a whole will enforce mask-wearing""  Like Jennifer, Emma, a student at the University of Sussex, wants tangible safety measures put in place. She shielded following a kidney transplant.  ""I am hoping the university as a whole will enforce mask-wearing as I know this is something that will make myself and others feel safer. I am sure the university has put lots of things in place, but it would be nice to know exactly what's going on.""  The University of Sussex said its student support team would work with students who have long-term health conditions and those ""anxious about returning to campus"" to find ""reasonable adjustments"" for them.  But for those students who are on work placements as part of their degree, the worry around safety is just as acute.  image copyright Lauren image caption Laura is concerned she has to choose between her career and her health  Lauren has BehÃ§et's disease, which causes inflammation of the blood vessels and tissues.  As a final year student of paramedic sciences at the University of Surrey her hospital placement was cancelled at the start of lockdown to protect her health, but she is worried this will impact the completion of her degree.  ""I am having to choose between my health and my career which is an awful decision to have to make. It feels almost impossible to plan going forward.""  With just a few weeks to go before students leave the safety of their family homes there still remains a lot of uncertainty.  The Department for Education said universities are ""autonomous institutions and we expect them to make judgements based on the latest public health guidance and communicate these clearly to students.""  It said this includes carrying out risk assessments and it had ""already seen a host of innovative measures being adopted, such as limiting travel times and student number rotas,"" although it did not say where these had been implemented.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-53552077,http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml,8337d1a3809c3dbac09f3fd68e12d0be0870cd21077643fe3cf72f8a23761984,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

There have been warnings of a ""perfect storm"" for working parents - of rising costs and providers closing. So how are parents managing?  ""I absolutely love my job,"" says 32-year-old Sharleen Smith, from Great Yarmouth. ""I want to do my work.""  Sharleen hated working from home during lockdown and was delighted to return to her magazine's office last month. But as the summer holidays approached, she became increasingly concerned about what to do with her seven-year-old daughter, Kourtney.  Every day she checked to see whether Kourtney's usual summer holiday club would open. Eventually it announced it would, but only for two weeks - leaving her and her partner with a four-week black hole over the summer holiday.  ""I don't want to be dramatic but it has been terrifying for me,"" says Sharleen, who has mild autism and says she has lost sleep over the issue of childcare. ""The unknown is the scariest thing possible.""  Her solution involves a mix of friends, family and a nursery that is accepting older children. But this summer isn't cheap. The holiday club is twice its usual price, and the nursery is double that.  Sharleen is one of many parents struggling with a ""childcare jigsaw"" during the school holidays, with many providers unable to operate under coronavirus guidelines, according to Coram Family and Childcare Trust.  Research suggests mums appear to be doing most of the family childcare during lockdown, and are able to do less uninterrupted work compared to dads.  ""As lockdown restrictions start to ease, many parents are being asked to go back to work but are facing the same childcare shortages they have been battling since lockdown began,"" says the charity's head Megan Jarvie.  ""This summer more than ever, we are at risk of seeing parents having little choice but to give up work completely.""  Holiday clubs have been particularly affected by government guidance being issued at ""short notice"", says Ms Jarvie.  Guidance published at the start of July - three weeks before most schools finished - said clubs must keep children in consistent bubbles of 15. This was later relaxed after clubs pointed out the same children do not necessarily attend on the same days - but for many providers that came too late.  'Left in front of screens'  ""We need clear daylight of six weeks to be able to mobilise our camps - and that would really be cutting it fine,"" says Neil Greatorex, founder of holiday club chain Barracudas.  This is the first summer in almost three decades he has not been able to open his sites. He says earlier guidance would have given him time to work out which of his 46 camps could run.  He thinks lots of parents will ""struggle"" this month. ""The service they rely on just isn't going to be there in the same way it normally is. A substantial part of the provision that is there throughout the UK is going to be missing.""  Image copyright Sharleen Smith Image caption Sharleen Smith and her partner are having to spend more on Kourtney's childcare this year  In Cambridge, Panash Shah decided he would run his three holiday clubs this summer, but has had to increase fees to pay for extra cleaning and around 20 additional members of staff needed to supervise the bubbles.  After a ""desperate rush"" to work out logistics once the guidance was published, he says he has only allowed parents to book one-week blocks, rather than odd days here and there.  Panash thinks this has ""scared off"" parents who may only need childcare for two days and do not want to book the whole week at an increased price.  ""What happens to those children? Will they be maybe potentially left in front of screens all day?"" he asks. ""Or would grandparents or other family members step in?""  Clare Freeman, of the Out of School Alliance, which supports holiday clubs, says the fact that grandparents ""may be unable to help due to health concerns"" will add to parents' woes.  ""Even leaving children with friends is problematic as we are being advised not to mix households,"" she says.  Rising costs  In Cheshire, Gemma, a travel agent who did not want her surname to be used, has looked after her two children while on furlough. But with her colleagues starting to return to work, and her partner working full-time, she is not sure what she will do if she is asked to go back over the summer. She says she was told she will be put on unpaid leave if she can't come in.  Holiday clubs near her have limited spaces, and their usual childminders aren't taking on any more work. Childminders who are available are double the price, she says, costing more than Â£60 a day.  ""I'm only on minimum wage anyway, so if and when I do go back to work and I have to start using a more expensive childminder it's probably pointless me going to work for the day.""  Image copyright Melanie Han Image caption Childminder Melanie Han still has work but says demand is far lower than usual  Gemma's usual childminders may be fully-booked, but half an hour's drive away in Warrington, Melanie Han is struggling to find business.  ""Usually I've got a very, very long waiting list,"" the childminder says, explaining that she thinks demand has slipped because parents are either at home themselves or are worried about the virus. She knows other childminders who have stopped working altogether.  A recent survey conducted by the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years (PACEY) suggested that around 40% of childminders were unsure if their businesses would be able to survive - particularly if the end of the furlough scheme in October leads to more redundancies.  ""I'm advertising on everything, and nobody's coming back to me. That would suggest there's no childcare needed, but in some areas it's really busy,"" Melanie says.  Local demand  Last week, Labour warned of a ""perfect storm"" of providers closing down and rising childcare costs. PACEY estimates that nine out of 10 early years childcare settings are open, but on average are only half are full.  Ms Freeman puts local variations down to ""demographics of different areas"": ""The decision of a local large employer regarding shutting down, or conversely recalling all furloughed staff back to work, will have a big effect on the local demand for childcare.""  Back in Great Yarmouth, Sharleen is relieved that she has found childcare, even if it is costing a lot more. But she is also aware, because she works early hours, that she will need to find childcare for Kourtney between 07:00 and 08:30, when school starts again.  She used to use the school's breakfast club, but that's not due to go ahead. ""I am worried about that,"" she says. ""I'm just actively trying to find a childminder that I can potentially take her to do the mornings. But I have got to a stage where there's not really much I can do about it at the moment.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53635932,http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml,7c566aec3a88223681c2e761555987e883f5b5a50284abff48e35bf349f4ebd5,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

So, as the words ""how did you feel after eating the ashtray?"" leave my mouth, I know I'm doing my profession proud.  ""I felt fulfilled! It was my first meal of the day!"" the answer comes back - and the three members of Bad Boy Chiller Crew, alongside their manager Darren, fall about laughing.  We're in an alleyway in their hometown, Bradford, talking about the most disgusting things they've ever done to get views online. Turns out, it's a pretty long list.  But what started out as mates uploading prank and comedy videos has now, bizarrely, morphed into a music career - and it's going so well that there is, I'm told, a realistic chance of our interview being crashed by fans.  Bradford, though, is apparently just the start - because Bad Boy Chiller Crew's aim is ""to take over the world"".  Image caption From left to right - Gareth, Darren, Kane and Clive  From the moment I'm picked up in a branded Bad Boy Chiller Crew Range Rover, with the guys' music coming out the speakers, it's clear they mean business.  ""No-one really sounds like us,"" Gareth says, ""We're in our own genre. It's very fast and there's never a dull moment.""  He's got a point. While musically they throw back to 00s bassline artists like T2, lyrically it's tongue-in-cheek funny and unashamedly Yorkshire.  However you classify it, it seems to be working.  Image copyright The Bad Boy Chiller Crew  Their breakout single, 450, has had close to two million views on YouTube - and been supported by the likes of Annie Mac on BBC Radio 1.  And that's on top of the millions more hits they've had for pranks, skits and drinking challenges across TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.  ""Sometimes we've done stuff so sick we've not even rung each other for three days,"" Gareth admits.  ""The amount of times we've gone home after doing something stupid and tossed and turned with anxiety, thinking: 'What have we actually just done?'""  The success is a lot to take in for three lads who, 18 months ago, were self-proclaimed ""dossers"" with jobs in ice cream vans or at a box-packing warehouse.  Our original plan to meet in the alley out the back of Kane's house, the scene of some of their wilder videos, had to be changed - because fans have found out where it is and started to show up unannounced.  You might also like:  ""It used to be bailiffs and police, now it's fans,"" Kane laughs, ""I've had about 10 in the past 24 hours - I'm going to have to move out soon!""  ""The main thing is putting a smile on people's faces,"" Gareth adds.  ""And to give people hope. So many MCs from up north have been trying to get recognised for ages and it's like we're finally putting that genre of MC on the map.""  Image copyright Mia Clark Image caption 'I'm going to have to move out soon - I'll take the caravan to the end of the street and live in that'  As for Darren, he's hoping Bad Boy Chiller Crew can be as a big a success globally as they are in Bradford.

""There are so many artists out there that are that are just so serious and fake, but these guys are just real,"" Darren says.

But other places have followed - so what can their residents learn from Leicester?  Restaurants, pubs and hairdressers in Leicester were able to reopen for the first time since March on Monday - weeks later than in other areas of England - and people have once again been allowed to make non-essential journeys and travel in and out of the city.  However, leisure centres, gyms and pools must remain closed and, like in some other areas of England, there is a ban on visiting people's homes, either indoors or in private gardens.  Recently, parts of northern England and Aberdeen have followed Leicester in being subject to tighter restrictions.  With the East Midlands city returning to some level of normality, we asked people what it had been like watching the rest of the country move on without them - and what could be learned from Leicester's experience.  Here are five lessons from the city's residents and businesses.  Stay connected  Image copyright Rosie Palmer Image caption Rosie Palmer said being in a lockdown when it was being eased elsewhere made it feel like ""danger was right outside your door""  ""It was like we were pariahs,"" said Rosie Palmer, 29. ""I've got family all over the country and I was seeing them going to the beach, meeting up with friends... and we were inside this danger bubble.""  Miss Palmer works as a counsellor at the city's LGBT centre, which has been helping an increasing number of young people, many of whom have been feeling isolated.  ""My advice is to keep talking about it,"" she added. ""Stay connected and don't try and bottle it all up.  ""If you're feeling anxious, that's OK, this is really scary.  ""Get sleep, keep a good eating routine, keep looking forward - it is going to be over. In the meantime, look after yourself.""  Break the monotony  Image copyright Claire Stevenson Image caption Claire Stevenson and her family celebrated an early Christmas - complete with decorations, mince pies and presents in stockings  The local lockdown also meant children who had just returned to school had to be sent home again.  Mother-of-three Claire Stevenson, from Knighton, works at a school and said there were ""a lot of tears"" as the Year Six pupils left for a second time.  The 45-year-old said lockdown had been particularly difficult for her young children, who knew friends and family around the country were able to go camping, to zoos and the beach while they had to stay inside.  To distract them, she and her husband let them repaint their rooms, cut each others' hair and even hosted a coronavirus ""Christmas Day"".  She said: ""I can sympathise with anyone stuck in local lockdown, as we in Leicester have felt isolated and it's been really hard seeing everywhere else opening back up.  ""Try and do some different things just to ease the monotony.  ""And make sure you stock up on wine - lots of wine.""

""When lockdown eased elsewhere my friends were going back to work and I was still just sitting at home,"" she said. ""It was like they were getting on with life while mine was on pause.  ""It can be very stressful but if it's something completely out of your control, don't beat yourself up about it.  ""I felt trapped in the circumstances but running helped me - try and stay as active as you can. And I'm back in the salon now - I'm proof that local lockdown does end.""  Maintain relationships  Image copyright Indy Burmi Image caption Indy Burmi said the problem was customers could go to where restrictions were lifted  Indy Burmi, owner of a hair salon, said the problem for him and his staff was their customers could just go to the reopened areas for their haircuts.  He said: ""They'd waited four months already. Because they opened up certain places you ran the risk of clients going across the road - we had to fight against that.""  He said to ""keep up a relationship"" with customers they could not see, staff sent out products, offered consultations over Instagram and discussed what could be done with clients' hair when they reopened.  ""I've not had a break,"" he added. ""But it worked, we're booked up for the next four weeks now.""  But not all businesses have been able to hold out.  Arti Chudasama, owner of The Pantry, made the ""heartbreaking"" decision to close her cafe after the second local lockdown was imposed.  She did this because she said she had no idea how long it would last, and whether customers would return to the city centre when it was eased.  Image copyright Arti Chudasama Image caption Arti Chudasama is determined not to ""let this be the end"" and is working on other projects, such as a cookery book and expanding into catering  To other business owners facing tough decisions about the future, she said: ""Just sit down and give yourself the time to think.

Stay strong  Image caption Rachael Bradley said she could understand how people in the north might be feeling as ""it's difficult to see everyone else let out""  We asked some people on the streets whether they had a message for people now finding themselves facing tougher restrictions than elsewhere.

Verdict: Developments of more than 1,000 dwellings may take that long, but those are very large. The vast majority of developments are much smaller and do not take that long.  Robert Jenrick, secretary of state for housing, communities and local government, wrote an article in the Sunday Telegraph talking about how he wants to change the planning system in England.  In the article, he wrote: ""Under the current system, it takes an average of five years for a standard housing development to go through the planning system - before a spade is even in the ground.""  The Reality Check team asked his department where this figure came from and was pointed towards a chart in the Letwin Review from 2018, which looked at why it takes so long to complete large housing projects.  The chart features 15 housing developments together with how long they took to get planning permission.  When you add up how long they each took and divide by the number of developments, you do indeed get about five, even though only five of them took five years or longer.  The 8,861 unit Barking Riverside development takes up the average considerably - its planning process took 12.5 years.  Image copyright Getty Images  The development of the site of the Barking power station was originally supposed to be supported by an extension of the Docklands Light Railway but will now be served by a London Overground Station.  It needed other transport links including roads, as well as schools, utilities and community facilities.  Mr Jenrick did not give a definition of a standard housing development, but according to research from the estate agents Savills. around 65% of homes given consent are on sites of fewer than 100 units.  There is also no legal definition of a standard development, although any development with more than 10 dwellings is counted as a major residential development.  The smallest one in the selection of 15 used to reach the five-year average is the 1,187 unit Trumpington Meadows development in Cambridge. The largest is the 15,737 unit development in North Greenwich. So they do seem to be very large developments rather than what might be deemed standard.  ""It is an easy throwaway comment and will be true in some cases,"" said Tony Mulhall, planning expert at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.  ""Most of the applications being referred to will have gone to appeal or perhaps judicial review.""  The property consultancy Lichfields did some similar research into how long the planning process took for different-sized developments.  How many years does it take to get planning permission for different-sized developments?  It found that the process takes longer the bigger the development, which is no great surprise.  The bigger the development, the more factors need to be dealt with such as water, electricity, roads and services such as GP surgeries and schools.  The average length of time for planning doesn't get close to five years until you start looking at developments of more than 1,000 units.  The government has already had a review of planning appeals, led by Bridget Rosewell. She said: ""At present, the inquiry process takes nearly a year to complete from lodging the appeal to a decision for inspector decided cases.""  ""This is just too long."" She suggested that this part of the process could be reduced to six months reasonably easily.  Image copyright Getty Images  The government publishes statistics on how long planning decisions by district level planning authorities in England have been taking. (The vast majority of residential planning decisions are taken at this level, although the secretary of state and Mayor of London might also get involved.)  The latest figures show that 89% of major applications were decided within 13 weeks.  So while the biggest developments may indeed average five years for planning, that isn't the case for most projects.  What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

BBC Sport is sitting down with five former gymnasts - Sophie Jameson, Olivia Williams, Abbie Caig, Georgina Clements and Amber Leyland have agreed to tell their stories, in light of the widespread allegations of abuse that have rocked the sport in recent weeks.  This summer, Olympic dreams should have been realised. Instead, multiple claims - including from Olympians such as Becky and Ellie Downie, and Amy Tinkler - of a culture of fear across gymnastics in this country have been made by those who feel they can no longer stay silent.  They are nervous. Caig admits she nearly backed out, but all of them are united in the importance of speaking out.  ""I'd suppressed the emotions and buried them away,"" Caig adds. ""I feel like speaking out now is going to allow me to get everything I want off my chest and I can finally move on.""  The five women, now aged from 18 to 23, trained at the City of Liverpool Gymnastics Club for differing periods between 2008 and 2019.  The club coached four of the five women who donned the Team GB leotard at the London 2012 Olympics - but behind the scenes, some gymnasts say their experiences of training at the club were a lot different to that memorable event.  ""It was not a happy place, and it should have been a happy place, and a fun place,"" says Caig. ""It was a sport that we all loved but for me, it turned into a sport that I absolutely hated.""  Their stories are, by now, all too familiar. But in the quest for medal glory, these gymnasts blame British Gymnastics, the sport's governing body, for prioritising success over the wellbeing of individuals.  ""Maybe they turned a blind eye because of the talent,"" says Jameson.  ""Maybe they thought that the treatment we were given was working. It produced many champions, many Olympians, maybe British Gymnastics thought that's the treatment they deserve.""  In a statement to BBC Sport, British Gymnastics said: ""Any mistreatment of gymnasts is inexcusable. It is vital that concerns are made public, whether that is through the media or our processes.""  Since last month, UK Sport and Sport England have co-commissioned an independent review aimed at ""bringing about positive change"" in the sport.  A confidential helpline, run jointly by the British Athletes Commission (BAC) and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), has also been set up for British gymnasts who say they have suffered bullying or abuse.  British Gymnastics added: ""We have continued to receive complaints in recent weeks which our integrity unit is assessing as quickly as possible.""  The City of Liverpool Gymnastics Club declined to provide a statement to BBC Sport but it is understood it strongly denies any allegations of bullying or mistreatment of athletes, and the gym maintains no such complaint or allegation has been made to it, and that the welfare and safety of athletes was at all times its first priority.  Liverpool City Council, which runs the gym, confirmed to the BBC that it has received eight complaints about the gym in the past five years but none related to the five women interviewed for this piece.  A spokesperson added: ""Any complaints received to the city council have been dealt with in accordance with our procedures and any actions will have been taken as appropriate. Allegations of bullying or harassment are clearly a cause for concern and any submitted to the council will be investigated.""  'I'd go home at night and just cry'  All but one of the five gymnasts BBC Sport spoke to have retired from the sport, with Williams moving to college gymnastics last year in the United States. Two are now coaches themselves.  But the impact of their experiences as gymnasts has had a long-lasting effect on all five of the women, who say they now suffer from anxiety.  ""It started before you even got into the gym, as soon as you got up it was 'right, I'm scared of going in',"" says Leyland.  Caig agrees: ""I'd wake up and feel physically sick, knowing that I had to go to school, and get through that part of my day, and then go and train. To be honest, I wanted to stay in school, I'd rather have detention than go to the gym and train.  ""It just wasn't an environment you wanted to be in at all.""  To this day, Clements and Jameson both admit they still ""struggle to make friends"" because of their anxiety.  ""I'd go home at night, close my bedroom door, and I'd just cry,"" said Jameson.  ""When I look back, it makes me really sad, because that's made me the way I am today - I am so anxious.""  Clements adds: ""I blocked it out of my head for years.  ""It's gone on for years, and until we've got older, we've not realised how bad it actually was, and actually looked back and thought 'that shouldn't have happened'.""  Many of the gymnasts who have spoken publicly since the allegations of abuse within gymnastics started to emerge in July have referred to issues with their weight.  Former British gymnast Nicole Pavier, who did not train at the City of Liverpool, previously told BBC Sport how gymnasts were sometimes weighed twice a day and weight-shamed.  Jameson says that frequent weighing throughout her gymnastics career led to the development of an eating disorder.  Gymnasts are well versed in pushing through the pain barrier in a sport which is physically tough, but all five gymnasts remember times when they felt it went too far, when they were in so much pain from injuries that they could not continue training.  On one occasion, Caig claims she was left alone on the bars while her training group was taken to another apparatus by a coach.  Caig says she struggled to complete her routine because she was ""exhausted mentally, emotionally, physically"" and was left with ""raw and bleeding"" fingertips.  She alleges she only stopped when another gymnast alerted a different coach because the bars were too slippery from Caig's blood for her to complete her routine.  Leyland's parents say they withdrew their daughter from the gym after she was hurt at the age of 11 while training on the beam.  ""I landed awkward and I heard a click in my foot. I heard it, one of the other gymnasts next to me heard it, but I was told to carry on,"" she says.  ""It was up to me to ring my dad to come and pick me up and take me to the hospital, where they told me I'd broken my foot in four places.""  'My mum feels that she failed as a parent'  All five say they struggled to tell their parents of their experiences at the time.  BBC Sport was told that parents often had no idea what their children were doing during training, that they were not usually allowed to view sessions and that glass in the doors at the Liverpool gym was often covered, or the view obscured with screens.  Most of the gymnasts only told their parents of their experiences once they had retired, while the parents of others have only heard about what their children experienced in recent weeks, since the first allegations were made public.  ""My mum has been heartbroken. She has actually cried to me and says that she feels that she failed as a parent,"" says Jameson.  ""Our parents were probably just as manipulated as we were as gymnasts. It's not their fault, they didn't know what was going on, and they couldn't watch anyway, even if they wanted to know.""  Jameson, Williams, Caig, Clements and Leyland join an ever-extending list of current and former gymnasts to speak about their experiences in the sport, including Olympic bronze medallist Tinkler and her Rio 2016 team-mates the Downie sisters.  For Williams, it was moving to an entirely different environment in the US that allowed her to find her voice.  ""I moved to college gymnastics a year ago and it has taken me the whole year to get used to being coached normally and respectfully, and being able to have a voice, to learn I can express how I actually feel without being shut down or shouted at,"" she says.  Caig adds: ""I don't think we realised how bad it really was. Us coming together speaking, I feel like I've got a lot off my chest.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/gymnastics/53401847,http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml,202c7bb70364fa01b3f6c3a0fe208ac6d47f4f352d4a2d89a3318881c1bb4c06,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Cordelia Clark's first home felt within reach. The 27-year-old was about to scramble on to the housing ladder, but then a twist appeared.  One of the UK's biggest mortgage lenders, Nationwide, altered the rules.  There's now a tighter limit on how much your family can help you when you're getting your deposit together. The bank of mum and dad - as it's often known.  Cordelia's story  Cordelia has been looking around Scarborough for the last year and has a decent income for the area.  She'd got the biggest loan she could, and was looking for houses up to Â£130,000.  ""It's a two-bed terrace, outdoor space, no driveway or anything but would get me on the property ladder.""  Cordelia has a decent credit history but reached the maximum amount she could borrow for a mortgage.  Any more money she needed would have to come from her deposit.  Image caption Cordelia thought she had her perfect first house  The offer was in but the estate agent called and asked for a little more.  Cordelia's parents said they would help her out, increase her deposit and get her over the line.  But now Nationwide won't allow the bank of mum and dad to add so much to it.  The UK's second-largest lender has tightened its rules because of uncertainty in the economy.  Now, to get a mortgage with a 10% deposit, the buyer must prove that they saved 75% of that deposit themselves.  Other banks have not followed on with cutting out parental help but it's still early days.  Throughout the pandemic, multiple housing indexes show that the amount of first-time buyers as a proportion of the market has been falling.  Some mortgage brokers say first-time buyers with a 10% deposit or less will have seen the number of mortgage deals available to them fall by more than half.  Nationwide told Radio 1 Newsbeat that the decision to stop the bank of mum and dad helping people get their first home is hopefully just a temporary one.  Last month Nationwide lowered the minimum deposit it needed from first-time buyers to 10% from 20 July.  But for Cordelia, it's a blow.  ""If you see that the majority of the mortgage is coming from you, I don't really see it as a problem,"" she says.  ""Your parents are there to support you - that's just the way life goes.""  A Nationwide spokesman said: ""This as a temporary measure which will remain under frequent review and fully gifted deposits are accepted on lending up to 85%.  ""However, as one of the first lenders to return to 90% LTV lending in what remains an uncertain market, we have needed to be cautious to protect borrowers and ourselves.""  LTV stands for loan-to-value. So if your LTV is 90% - you're borrowing 90% of the value of your house and putting up the remaining 10% yourself as a deposit.  Image caption Topsy Taiwo gives video help on social media to first-time buyers  Topsy Taiwo is a property expert and gives video social media advice on getting on the housing ladder.  He says the change will have an immediate impact on young people getting their first home due to the amount who only have small deposits, but it might be a good chance for them to revaluate their requirements as a buyer.  ""I know a lot of people are dead set on staying in the areas they've grown up in and lived in.  ""With people working from home this might be an option to re-evaluate your search criteria.""  Topsy's tips  Don't put all your eggs in one basket with one lender.  Keep in regular contact with a mortgage broker.  There are still a lot of positives reasons to buy in the next six months such as the stamp duty holiday.  Look at new areas as travel times may be reduced in the future.

Olivia Biggart achieved five As in her Higher prelims and was predicted by her teachers to be awarded the same when her results arrived on Tuesday morning.  But despite having spent the summer studying for the University Clinical Aptitude Test (Ucat), she was awarded two As and three Bs.  Olivia, 16, believes she was downgraded because of where she lives.  Scotland's exam results day has been marred by disappointment for thousands of pupils who received worse grades than they had been expecting.  It emerged that exam body the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) had lowered 125,000 estimated grades - a quarter of the total.  Candidates were already apprehensive after official exams were cancelled for the first time in history due to the coronavirus.  Results were worked out using estimates made by teachers, based on the pupil's performance over the school year.  But a national moderation system meant that many pupils received lower grades than originally estimated.  Image copyright David Biggart Image caption David Biggart believes his daughter would have been awarded different grades if her school was in an affluent area  Many claimed they suffered because they are from less affluent areas.  Olivia's father, David Biggart believes his daughter was one of them. The family lives in Motherwell in North Lanarkshire.  Mr Biggart said: ""It is a small school and in a poorer catchment area. Olivia got seven As in her Nat 5 exams. She was in fifth year doing maths, English, chemistry, physics and PE. The school predicted five As and that is what they submitted to the SQA.  ""We had increased our expectations based on Olivia's prelims, researching medical schools.  ""Olivia has been studying all summer for the Ucat medical test to study medicine at university, but all her dreams are now in tatters as a result of the SQA and their treatment of poorer schools and high achieving pupils at those schools.  ""I am absolutely livid at the SQA.""  'Devastated for her'  Mr Biggart said he strongly believed it would not be the case if his daughter achieved the same predicted results but went to a school in a more affluent area.  ""I called the school and they were devastated for her and the rest of the pupils they felt had been unfairly treated. I worry for those who maybe expected three C grades and were given nothing.""  He said: ""She got 85% in her maths prelim and her teacher suggested a maths-related career. She has never scored a B in maths. It goes against everything. I feel distraught for her after how hard she worked over the summer.""  Olivia told the BBC she was not expecting the results she got.  Image copyright PA Media Image caption Many pupils chose to receive their results electronically on Tuesday morning  She said: ""I was not too stressed when I woke up. I thought I knew what to expect. I saw the A for chemistry and thought it was okay but then came the Bs. I was really shocked.""  The SQA said its moderation process had ensured ""fairness to all learners"" and maintained ""standards and credibility"" in the qualification system.  'Credibility issue'  Asked about the process at her daily briefing, Nicola Sturgeon said: ""What we want to make sure is that this year's results have the degree of credibility that means that they are not so out of sync with previous years that people are going to look at them and say 'they don't make any sense'.  ""As much as I would love to be in the position of standing here credibly saying that 85% of the 20% in the most deprived areas had passed Higher, given that it was 65% last year, that would raise a real credibility issue.""  Image copyright PA Media Image caption Education Secretary John Swinney said pupils had shown ""tremendous resilience""  Education Secretary John Swinney stressed that approximately 90% of moderation ""involved a change of just one grade"".  He added: ""We've maintained the overwhelming majority of estimates that have been put forward by teachers and the changes that have been made are essentially those fine-grained judgments that are required to be made on an annual basis.""  He said the SQA would ensure ""sufficient resources were in place"" for the free appeals process, allowing teachers and pupils to challenge specific results.  SQA chief examining officer Fiona Robertson said it was not possible to determine why the overall estimated grades were higher than previous years, adding: ""There may be several reasons why estimates were above historic attainment, which has been relatively stable over time.  ""Some teachers and lecturers may have been optimistic, given the circumstances of this year, or may have believed, correctly or incorrectly, that this cohort of candidates may have achieved better grades due to a range of factors.""",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-53653683,http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/uk/rss.xml,610a7f212fcb7c9642d5e1c8f4ade219638712292a0e6a60db0a520916fd6faf,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The paper also pictures rescue workers in Beirut as it reports that there were ""repeated warnings"" of the risk of an explosion.  Image caption ""The lost city"" is the headline of the i newspaper, over an image of dust and smoke hanging over the rubble that was Beirut's port area. The paper says the explosion, which left 300,000 people homeless and killed more than 100, ""seals the collapse of Lebanon"".  Image caption The Financial Times headline quotes Lebanon's president, Michel Aoun, pledging to punish the ""negligent"" following the blast. The paper says port officials were put under house arrest after an initial investigation suggested the cause of the explosion was thousands of tonnes of fertiliser stored for six years at the port.  Image caption A photo of an army helicopter dropping water on the smouldering wreckage of Beirut's port fills much of the Daily Telegraph's front page.

""The lost city"" is the i newspaper's headline, as many papers carry pictures of the ruined port area of Beirut or the desperate efforts of rescue teams looking for survivors.

""Pupils face exam chaos 'life sentence"" is the headline in the Daily Telegraph.  It reports the view of Dr Martin Stephen - the former head of St Paul's Boys school in London - who worries that the life chances of students could be permanently affected by restrictions on appeals. The only grounds for appeal will be technical ones, such as an irregularity in process, rather than because they feel they've been given an unfair mark.  A headline in the Huff Post declares that the government is under pressure to avoid ""an exam results 'disaster' that hurts the poorest"".  It details how, as education bosses grappled with the first school year without exams, Scottish politicians came under fire because moderated results appeared to favour those from affluent backgrounds.  Along with several papers, it reports that Labour has written to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson seeking ""urgent reassurance"" the same will not be repeated south of the border next week.  The Scottish regulator says the most disadvantaged young people achieved better results in 2020 than in 2019 or than the average results for the last four years.

""Red tape to be slashed"" is the headline as it reports that the government's white paper will allow for quicker approval for homes, schools, and hospitals, with councils losing the power to block developments.  It is the main story for the Guardian too, which carries a warning from charities and architects that the ""rushed"" shake-up will lead to ""more slums"".  The Sun takes a different view: its headline declares, ""In hod we trust"". It reports that the Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick will unveil reforms that will not only be a bonanza for brickies, but that will help kickstart the economy.  The paper says ""Rob the Builder"", as it christens Mr Jenrick, wants small and medium-sized firms to build a substantial chunk of the 300,000 new homes each year.  Its editorial backs the plan. ""Bring on the revolution,"" it says, arguing the changes will be a godsend for a generation priced out of the housing market, while ensuring fairer competition in construction.  ""Jail killers of 999 workers for life"" is the main headline for the Daily Express. Its front page is given over to the launch of an appeal by Lissie Harper - the widow of PC Andrew Harper - calling for an ""Andrew's Law"" to ensure anyone who kills an emergency worker is locked up for life.  Image copyright PA Media Image caption Lissie Harper said she wanted the families of killed emergency workers to ""get the justice they rightly deserve""  Metro and the Times also provide coverage of the campaign, quoting Mrs Harper saying she wants to ensure that anyone else who has to go through the loss she has experienced will ""get the justice they rightly deserve"".  The Guardian's front page carries a claim that attitudes to the menopause are ""forcing NHS medics out"".  It is based on research carried out by the British Medical Association which found that 90% of the 2,000 doctors who responded said menopause symptoms had affected their working lives.  Two-fifths said they were unable to make changes to working patterns to cope better. Almost half said they had not felt comfortable discussing the issue because of stigma and potential career blight - with many leaving GP partnerships and ending their positions as clinical leaders and directors as a result.  The doctors' union tells the paper that experienced staff should not be forced to make that choice because of inflexibility during a relatively short phase of life.

Mark Brazant attacked Josephine Conlon, 36, in Streatham Hill, south London, on 30 December last year.  The 44-year-old, who had been freed from jail on Christmas Eve, stabbed her seven times in the face and neck.  At the Old Bailey, Brazant, of Ealing, pleaded guilty to attempted murder. He will be sentenced on 16 September.  During a previous trial, he had denied meaning to seriously injure Mrs Conlon and the jury was discharged after failing to reach a verdict.  However, the prosecution called for a retrial and Brazant changed his plea on Thursday.  The original trial heard that Brazant, who has paranoid schizophrenia, had a history of attacking lone women for no reason and on 26 November carried out four assaults in one day.  He pleaded guilty to three charges of battery and one of common assault, but was released on licence from Thameside Prison to spend a year on post-sentence supervision.

It relates to the 2014 sale of Â£1.2bn in property loans by the Republic of Ireland's state asset agency Nama to US investment firms.  It is understood the two to be charged are businessman Frank Cushnahan, 78, and lawyer Ian Coulter, 49.  The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said there was ""sufficient evidence"" to jointly charge the men with fraud.  The National Asset Management Agency (Nama) was set up by the then Irish government to deal with toxic loans after Ireland's banking crisis in 2008.  Nine people had been placed under investigation in 2017 by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) for allegations of fraud, bribery and corruption.  The NCA passed a file for consideration to the PPS in 2018.  On Thursday, the PPS said it would not prosecute six individuals, while a decision was previously taken in 2018 not to prosecute a further suspect.  Mr Cushnahan is to be charged with fraud for allegedly failing to disclose information between 1 April, 2013 and 7 November, 2013.  Mr Coulter is alleged to have made a false representation on or around 11 September, 2014, making an article in connection with a fraud on or about 13 August, 2014 and two counts of concealing, disguising or transferring criminal property between 15 September, 2014 and 1 December, 2014.  Both men are accused of making a false representation made on or around 3 April, 2014.  Mr Coulter's solicitor, John Finucane, said his client ""enters into what will undoubtedly be a lengthy court process lasting years, where he will maintain his innocence to the offences alleged, as he has throughout this drawn out process"".  Mr Cushnahan's solicitor, Joe Rice, said his client denied the charges against him.  ""We are extremely disappointed with the decision that has been taken to prosecute and we will be pleading not guilty at any forthcoming criminal trial.""  No date has yet been set for the two men to appear in court.  Image copyright RTÃ Image caption Nama, which was established in 2009, is based in the Irish Treasury Building in Dublin  The PPS said the investigation focused on the sale and attempted sale of Nama's Northern Ireland loan book, called Project Eagle, to two US investment firms.  PPS assistant director Ciaran McQuillan said the organisation had been working ""in close partnership"" with the NCA and had ""painstakingly examined"" a considerable volume of evidence.  ""Whilst the test for prosecution was met in respect of two suspects, it was considered not met on evidential grounds in respect of seven further individuals with regard to the Project Eagle investigation,"" he said.  ""As criminal proceedings will commence in due course and each defendant has the right to a fair trial, it is extremely important to protect the integrity of any future trial that there should be no reporting, commentary or sharing of information online which could in any way prejudice those proceedings.""  'Significant milestone'  NCA deputy director of investigations Craig Taylor described the prosecutions as a ""significant milestone"".  ""This operation has been and remains an incredibly complex investigation, which is of enormous importance to the public in Northern Ireland and beyond,"" he said.

The new casualty figures on Thursday morning include at least 5,000 injured and a health ministry spokesman said dozens were still missing. âThis toll is not final,â he said.  As volunteers worked with the army to clean up damaged streets, buildings and hospitals, the government said it had formed an investigation committee to look into the explosion, which appears to have been set off by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate t stored at the port since 2014.  Q&A What is ammonium nitrate, the chemical blamed for the blast in Beirut? Show Hide Ammonium nitrate is a common industrial chemical used mainly for fertiliser because it is a good source of nitrogen for plants. It is also one of the main components in mining explosives. It is not explosive on its own, rather it is an oxidiser, drawing oxygen to a fire â and therefore making it much more intense. However, it ignites only under the right circumstances, and these are difficult to achieve. While ammonium nitrate can in fact put out a fire, if the chemical itself is contaminated, for example with oil, it becomes highly explosive. Helen Sullivan and Tom Phillips  Lebanese officials have started blaming each other for leaving the highly explosive substance sitting so close to residential neighbourhoods for six years. The ammonium nitrate was taken from a ship that docked in Beirut in 2013 and was apparently abandoned by its Russian owner and mostly Ukrainian crew.  Badri Daher, the director general of Lebanese customs, said on Wednesday his office had sent six letters to the countryâs judiciary urging them to deal with the chemicals either by exporting the load, reselling it or giving it to the army.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Part of the destroyed port as rescue work continues. Photograph: Wael Hamzeh/EPA  An unspecified number of port officials have been ordered to be placed under house arrest pending the investigation, which is scheduled to take five days. It will report to the national cabinet, which will refer its findings to the judiciary.  Amnesty International was among the organisations calling for an independent investigation into the circumstances leading up to the explosion.  âWhatever may have caused the explosion, including the possibility of a large amount of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely, Amnesty is calling for an international mechanism to be promptly set up to investigate how this happened,â said Julie Verhaar, the groupâs acting secretary general.

Beirut's ground zero: a rip through the heart of an already dying city Read more  The French president, Emmanuel Macron, arrived in Beirut on Thursday morning, the first world leader to visit since the disaster.  He is expected to call for international aid to rebuild Beirut but also press for changes to the political system â a major hurdle to receiving billions of dollars of aid to alleviate one of the worst financial crises in modern Lebanese history.  âFor the president, itâs a matter of showing that France is there â that is its role â and that he believes in Lebanon,â the presidential palace said. âThe visit is also an opportunity to lay down the foundations for a pact for the reconstruction of Lebanon, binding for all, that will limit conflicts, offer immediate aid and open up a long-term perspective.â  Play Video 1:57 Beirut bride describes moment explosion hit during wedding photoshoot â video  French aircraft were among several, including others from Turkey, Germany, Gulf countries and the World Food Programme, to land in Beirut since Tuesday, bringing rescuers, medical supplies and equipment.

The post included video of Trump falsely asserting that children were âalmost immune from Covid-19â during an appearance on Fox News. There is evidence to suggest that children who contract Covid-19 generally experience milder symptoms than adults do. However, they are not immune, and some children have become severely ill or died from the disease.  âThis video includes false claims that a group of people is immune from Covid-19 which is a violation of our policies around harmful Covid misinformation,â a Facebook spokesperson said.  The Twitter account for Trumpâs re-election campaign, @TeamTrump, also posted the video, which Twitter said violated its rules. âThe account owner will be required to remove the Tweet before they can Tweet again,â a company spokesperson said of @TeamTrump.  During a press briefing on Wednesday afternoon, Trump repeated his false claims about children and the disease.  The removals are the latest in a recent string of enforcement actions by social media platforms against the president over violating content rules related to misinformation, hate speech and threats of violence.  Trumpâs presidential campaign and tenure in office have been defined by his aggressive use of social media platforms to spread racism, xenophobia, threats and misinformation. For years, the US-based social media platforms that enabled his broadcasts were hesitant to enforce their own rules against him.  But the combined crises of the coronavirus pandemic and widespread civil unrest over the police killing of George Floyd appear to have inspired greater resolve among social media executives, with Twitter and Twitch taking action against Trump for threatening protesters, spreading misinformation about voting and, in Twitchâs case, using hate speech.  Facebook has been more reticent to take action against the president over his speech. When Trump quoted a 1960s racist police chief by posting, âWhen the looting starts the shooting startsâ during the uprisings over the police killing of George Floyd, the statement was widely condemned as incitement to violence and removed by Twitter.  Facebook defended Trumpâs right to post the statement, however, prompting anger among Democrats and civil rights activists. The company said it considered the statement to be a warning rather than a threat, because it came from a state actor.  While Wednesdayâs post is the first time that Facebook has taken action against Trumpâs account for coronavirus misinformation stated by the president himself, earlier this year the company did remove a series of ads and an organic post by Trump that featured a symbol historically associated with Nazis and in July it removed a video Trump shared to his account promoting an unproven cure for coronavirus.  Courtney Parella, the deputy national press secretary for the Trump campaign, responded to Facebookâs takedown with a statement that mischaracterized Trumpâs appearance on Fox News.  âThe president was stating a fact that children are less susceptible to the coronavirus,â Parella said. âAnother day, another display of Silicon Valleyâs flagrant bias against this president, where the rules are only enforced in one direction. Social media companies are not the arbiters of truth.â  The battle over misinformation on Facebook has proven politically contentious, with ongoing action for and against removal of content. Trump and the Republican party have repeatedly claimed without evidence that major tech companies are biased against conservatives.  On Wednesday, the same day of Facebookâs most recent removal, a group of 20 state attorneys general released a letter calling on the company to prevent the spread of hate, harassment and disinformation. In antitrust hearings last week, Republican lawmakers repeatedly grilled Mark Zuckerberg over the same issue, claiming the platform should leave these posts up.  No evidence has emerged to suggest that tech company moderators (or the rules the tech companies ask them to enforce) display partisan political bias. Most of the platforms do have rules against hate speech, the incitement of violence and dangerous misinformation about Covid-19.

Some Conservative MPs have been lobbying for their constituencies to be exempt from the restrictions, which stop people having visitors in their gardens or meeting other households in the pub. In Leigh, in Wigan, new Tory MP James Grundy wrote to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, yesterday arguing against the âone-size-fits-allâ approach which locked down all 2.8 million residents of Greater Manchester, even in districts like Wigan where infection rates are low.  In Shipley, a constituency in the Bradford district, the Conservative MP Philip Davies used his column in the Bradford Telegraph yesterday to advocate for Shipley and nearby Keighley to âbreak awayâ from Bradford, arguing his constituents should not have been included in the âblanket lockdown thrown over the entire district, unnecessarilyâ. In Calderdale, Tory MP Craig Whittaker said that in his Calder Valley constituency in West Yorkshire it was âthe BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic] communities that are not taking this seriously enoughâ. Whittaker provided no evidence for his claim and was widely condemned.  But few health experts believe Hancock will lift the restrictions tomorrow, after just a week, as infections continue to increase in almost all of the areas where restrictions were tightened a week ago. For example, in Stockport in Greater Manchester, the seven-day rate of positive tests per 100,000 people has risen to 25.9 for the week ending 1 August (up from 15.7 in the week ending 25 July and 7.2 the week before that). The local council says it has seen an increase in infections âin particular teenagers and younger adults, but also the 40-49 age groupâ.  If anything, more areas could be added to the locked-down area. Leeds, so far exempt despite being just 10 miles from Bradford, recorded 129 cases last week, up from 40 the week before.

A long-awaited planning white paper was published on Wednesday envisaging land across England being divided into three categories: for growth, renewal or protection. Concerns have been raised that democratic oversight could be diluted and affordable housing cut back.  In a round of morning interviews, Jenrick said the proposals would lead to more social housing through a new infrastructure levy and that there would be âa really serious debateâ in communities when plans were being produced.  How the planning system shake-up will affect housing in England Read more  Critics of the proposals laid out in the Planning for the Future document say the measures would in effect strip away a whole layer of scrutiny at local level in which councillors, the public and others take part as applications make their way through the system.  Facing criticism from Labour, which labelled the white paper a âdeveloperâs charterâ, Jenrick told BBC Radio 4 he had âno ideaâ how much property developers had donated to the Tories in the past year. âWeâre actually asking developers to pay more,â he said.  Asked about the Royal Institute of British Architectâs comments that the proposals were âshamefulâ, he told Sky News: âThat Iâm afraid is complete nonsense. I saw those comments and they were put out before weâd even published the document.â  âDesign and qualityâ would be at the heart of the new process, he told Talk Radio, adding that âevery local communityâ would be able to create their own binding design code to which developers would have to adhere  âMore money is going to be spent on social infrastructure as a result of these reforms than has been in the past, and a much simpler system,â he said. âThese reforms are going to really help smaller builders. This isnât going to help the big volume house builders, this is designed to help smaller builders â¦ in the market â theyâve declined significantly over the course of the last 20 or 30 years.â  The white paper says the new system would âmake it easier for those who want to build beautifully through the introduction of a fast-track for beauty through changes to national policy and legislation, to automatically permit proposals for high-quality developments where they reflect local character and preferencesâ.  Areas identified as growth zones and âsuitable for substantial developmentâ would automatically be granted âoutline planning permission for the principle of developmentâ, it states, while automatic approvals would also be available for pre-established development types in other areas suitable for building.  âThere will therefore be no need to submit a further planning application to test whether the site can be approved,â the document says.  The policy director of the Town and Country Planning Association called on the government to provide evidence of how the current planning system was âdesperately brokenâ.  Hugh Ellis told the Today programme: âChange is a good thing to planning, thereâs no doubt about that, but the most important thing is that peopleâs voice is not going to be enhanced, this is not a democratisation of planning and that is really troubling to us.â  The shadow housing minister Mike Amesbury said: âThis is a developerâs charter that will see communities sidelined in decisions and denied vital funding for building schools, clinics and community infrastructure.â  The Local Government Associationâs chairman, James Jamieson, said nine in 10 applications were approved by councils, with more than a million homes given planning permission over the last decade yet to be built, and that the system should focus on that.  âAny loss of local control over developments would be a concern,â said Jamieson, who is also the Tory council leader in central Bedfordshire.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/06/robert-jenrick-concerns-planning-overhaul-nonsense-housing-england,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,d6626d6c85754e6dc8dfba0af70665896a4c334848596d82ab816a63a9bf520e,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

This would mean parts of Britain could pass the threshold for an âofficial heatwaveâ, which requires three days of temperatures over 25C (77F) or higher in different parts of the country.  London and the south-east are expected to experience the highest temperatures on Friday, but northern areas such as Manchester and Leeds will also hit the low 30s.  Last week, on 31 July, the UK recorded the hottest day of the year so far and the third-warmest on record, with the mercury rising to 37.8C (100.04F) at Heathrow airport.  The coastguard reported its busiest day for more than four years as it dealt with more than 300 incidents.

He added: âItâs pretty unusual to get two successive events like this within a week of each other with such high temperatures.â  The heatwave conditions are expected to last until Sunday before cold air moves in overnight, but conditions are expected to stay hot and humid next week with chances of thundery showers.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/06/beachgoers-warned-to-stay-safe-as-uk-braces-for-potential-heatwave,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,f605ea2f56e1c6ef852df490f4efe8ff4f7eeee8afbe7b01d634e8191544733a,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

This number will rise significantly as the new cohort of medical students progress, almost 60% of whom are female.  âIt is extremely concerning to find that some women may be permanently stepping back from senior positions in medicine â a key cause of the gender pay gap â and the health service may be losing highly experienced staff because of inflexibility and a lack of support during a relatively short phase of life,â said Dr Helena McKeown, BMA representative body chair.  âThe health service is under immense pressure and we cannot afford to lose experienced doctors because of a lack of flexibility and support,â she added.  More than 90% of the 2,000 respondents said that their menopause symptoms had affected their working lives but two-fifths (38%) said they were unable to make the changes they needed to their working pattern to cope with symptoms.  Almost half said they had wanted to discuss their symptoms and seek support but did not feel comfortable doing so. A significant number said they would be âlaughed at or ridiculedâ by both managers and peers if they spoke about the menopause. Only 16% of respondents had discussed their menopause symptoms with their manager.  âA clear theme throughout these kinds of responses is that the women still enjoyed their career but found they just couldnât manage their symptoms at work,â the report found. âAs one doctor said, âI left a job I loved.ââ  Some respondents who were in male-dominated specialties believed that raising the topic and asking for changes or adjustments to help them manage their symptoms would be viewed negatively and add to the gender bias they already experienced.  There was also concern that it would damage their career progression and they would be labelled as ânot up to the jobâ or that colleagues would think they were âpast itâ and career opportunities would be taken away.  âThere are very few older women left at my senior level in my traditional profession. If I mentioned my perimenopausal symptoms, I would be stigmatised and disrespected as someone who was no longer rational or capable,â said one respondent.  Prof Neena Modi, president of the Medical Womenâs Federation, added: âThe menopause affects more than half of the population, many to a debilitating extent. We hope this report will help employers provide appropriate support for their employees and end the taboos around a normal physiological process.â  A spokesperson for the NHS said: âThe vast majority of women will experience menopausal symptoms at some point in their lives so itâs important that people come forward to get the help they need, while itâs right that employers do what they can to recognise the health impacts of menopause.â  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: âThe health and wellbeing of all of our NHS and social care staff is our absolute priority. It is incredibly important that staff feel that they work in a safe and supportive environment where they are able to raise any issues which may affect their work with managers or colleagues.  âThe NHS People Plan, published last week, sets out the actions that will be taken to help the NHS become a modern and model employer and aims to improve physical and mental support for all staff.â  âThe menopause hit me like a rollercoasterâ  Dr Anne Carson, chair of BMA Northern Irelandâs consultant committee and consultant radiologist at Craigavon area hospital, has been having menopausal symptoms for the last five years.  âI never expected to have crippling menopausal symptoms â Iâve never not been able to deal with the demands of my life â but the menopause hit me like a rollercoaster.  âTalking about the menopause as a doctor is taboo. I held off for two years but I was suffering chronic sleep deprivation throughout that time because my night sweats were so bad. I could only sleep for a few hours at a time before having to get up to have a shower. I was getting to the point where my decision-making ability wasnât safe, so I had no choice: I had to tell my line manager.  âIt wasnât something I wanted to do because the stigma is so great but my line manager was actually very understanding.  âBut even though he was sympathetic, the way the NHS works means that if I wanted to try to regulate my sleep a little better by doing fewer night shifts and on-calls, my only option was to cut my overall hours dramatically. But that also meant I cut my take-home pay dramatically. Iâm a single mother of two children at university and that reduction in my salary hit me hard.  âThe NHS just isnât flexible enough: if Iâd been allowed to just cut my on-call hours, then I could have continued to work full-time and they would have kept my expertise. Northern Ireland has the worst consultant shortage in the UK and I was disappointed in myself that I had to add to that shortage, but the inflexibility of the NHS structure gave me no choice.â",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/06/female-doctors-in-menopause-retiring-early-due-to-sexism-says-study,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,609e68ab8c084e22f4ed561e5e26ab7b54ab0da605cb3947595eb480800debc3,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

In opening remarks at an Auckland court hearing on Thursday, defence lawyer Rachel Reed said she would not try to to justify his actions. âI do not in any way seek to condone or excuse his actions after Miss Millaneâs death,â she said, according to the New Zealand Herald. âI cannot and will not do so â they are inexcusable. This appeal is about whether the trial process miscarried.â  The defence team argued, it was reported, that the jury was not properly directed when it came to considering consent and did not have the experience to properly analyse expert evidence. The manâs lawyers also argued the sentence passed in February of life in prison with a minimum non-parole period of 17 years for the 28-year-old was manifestly unjust, saying there there was no evidence of excessive violence.  Reed said a guide given to the jury members on reaching a verdict did not give them the chance to assess the killerâs âhonest belief in consentâ and whether he had time to âform a reckless intentâ.  In November, a jury took just five hours to unanimously agree that the accused, whose name is suppressed, murdered Millane in his hotel room after the pair met on a date in Auckland in December 2018.  Her death by strangulation during sex provoked a debate in New Zealand and Britain about reliance on arguments of so-called ârough sexâ as a defence for murder. It also prompted an outpouring of grief in New Zealand and vigils for the young woman that were attended by thousands across the country.  On Thursday, Crown solicitor Brian Dickey, the prosecutor from the manâs original trial, disputed that the guide given to jurors was flawed and said consent was dealt with at length and was not a legally complex thing for a jury. He called the appeal grounds regarding the consent instructions âflimsyâ.  Thursdayâs hearing took place in front of three justices in the court of appeal, whose decision has been reserved to a later date.  Delivering the life sentence in February, Justice Simon Moore said the crime had shocked New Zealand and the killer showed no remorse. âManual strangulation is a particularly intimate form of violence â¦ cold-blooded,â Moore said. âYour actions reveal a complete disregard for your victim.  âYou didnât ring an ambulance, or call the police, instead you embarked on a well-planned and sustained and coordinated course of action to conceal any evidence of what had occurred in your room.â  Millane, 22, from Essex, arrived in New Zealand in November 2018 as part of a round-the-world trip. She met the man who killed her on the dating app Tinder.  After her death, the man buried her body in a suitcase in the Waitakere ranges, a bushland area west of New Zealandâs largest city. She was found eight days after she died.  During the sentencing hearing Millaneâs mother, Gillian Millane, read out a victim impact statement via videolink describing the destruction Millaneâs killer had wrought on her family.  âThe tears I shed are never-ending, at the thought of never having the chance to be able to kiss my darling Grace goodbye,â she said. âGrace was never just a daughter, she was my friend, my very best friend.  âI torment myself over what you did to my Grace, the terror and pain she must have experienced at your hands. As a mother I would have done anything to change places with her.  âI should have been there, but she died terrified and alone in a room with you.â",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/06/grace-millane-murderer-launches-appeal-against-conviction-and-sentence,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,ebf1cb1714c60c9ad39d6139fb407edaac89a1114440c46a512af855d34c750f,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Despite most of them seeing a spike in demand for their services during Covid-19, 15% of the charities will be forced to shut their doors within the next six months, and 45% within a year, according to data from the Small International Development Charities Network (SIDCN).  The pandemic â predicted to force one in 10 UK charities into bankruptcy by the end of 2020 â has delivered a triple whammy to smaller overseas charities, according to SIDCN. British charities working abroad have not been eligible to apply for the UK government coronavirus community support fund, and many British funders have amended their giving criteria to donate to projects based solely in the UK.  The Department for International Development (DfID)âs merger with the Foreign Office and the subsequent Â£2.9bn cut to the 2020 overseas aid programme have left little room for small charities to function, said CEO Rita Chadha of the Small Charities Coalition, which supports more than 100 small NGOs.  âThere are over 10,000 small international charities with an income of under Â£1m in the UK,â said Chadha. âTheir work rarely gets noticed beyond those that they directly work with, but their impact is huge. Helping young girls get an education, providing micro grants for businesses, and investing in clean drinking water is what makes us collectively safer and better. Covid-19 has proven we can no longer afford to think just local.â  Oxfam funding crisis puts 200 UK jobs at risk Read more  The findings echo financial woes at the fundraising charity Comic Relief, where one in four staff are facing redundancy and more than Â£5m running costs needed to cope with fallout from the pandemic, according to Third Sector.  SIDCN, which surveyed 53 small charities/nonprofits working overseas with a maximum annual income of Â£1m, found that 72% had seen an increased demand for their services during the pandemic, with 57% having had to postpone programmes or projects.  âThe lack of any support for international charities has been debilitating,â one charity head told researchers.  âWe have had to close the office and cut staff and staff hours but the demands on our now-reduced team have only increased. The amount of funding for immediate partner Covid needs is paltry,â  Murielle Maupoint, of East African Playgrounds, which has built more than 350 playgrounds and helped improve education for more than half a million children in Uganda, said that the charity had seen â95% of its funding disappear overnightâ .  Another charity in Uganda, Kids Club Kampala, which supports vulnerable children in slums, had toconvert classrooms into food banks to help with emergency food needs. Despite initially expecting to feed 1,000 families, they have so far fed 27,821 households with more than 600,000 food parcels, and have been asked by the Ugandan government to expand provision, said the charityâs CEO Olivia Barker White.  âThere has never been a greater need in Kampala for our services,â said Barker White, citing concerns over the potential long-term effects of lockdown such as child abuse, domestic violence, and mental health and family breakdown.  âWe desperately need to raise more funds to ensure we can provide support to those who need it most.â  Sophia Moreau of the Small Charities Coalition said that losing half of the UKâs charities overseas would have a devastating effect on global development. âSmall international charities may be small, but they have a huge impact,â said Moreau.  âThey are often the ones building the relationships on the ground with local partners and there wonât be anything to fill those gaps if they are forced to close down. Even the big international organisations are facing redundancies and cuts, so there will be a void where these small ones once were.â",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/aug/06/almost-half-of-uk-charities-for-worlds-poorest-set-to-close-in-a-year-survey-covid-19,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,082c6d470a267a5bb05311f186b2b70092f75e6265a3fb2908b70de962210b1c,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The boat, named Sea-Watch 4, will depart in a few days from the seaport of Burriana, near Valencia, in Spain, where volunteers are finalising preparations, the crew has said.  The mission, managed by United4Rescue â an initiative led by the Protestant church in Germany (EKD) and backed by more than 500 other organisations â is the result of a crowdfunding campaign launched a few months ago and named #WirschickeneinSchiff (âWe send a shipâ).  ââWe connect all social organisations and groups that do not want to stand by and watch thousands of people die in the Mediterranean,â United4Rescue says on its website. âWith the collection of donations, we support rescue organisations that act humanitarianly [sic], where politics fail. We are non-profit and finance ourselves, exclusively through donations. We expect clear responses from the European governments to our demands.ââ  The churchâs mission had already been announced in February, after a ceremony in the port city of Kiel, in northern Germany, which was attended by politicians, volunteers and church leaders.  âOne does not let any single human drown, end of discussion,â the head of EKD, Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, said during the ceremony. âThis ship has to be out there, because European states do not intend, nor do they manage to rescue people in the Mediterranean.ââ  The ship was due to sail from Spain as early as April, but the pandemic slowed down works, forcing the crew to postpone their mission.  âThe Sea-Watch 4 is desperately needed â with several shipwrecks in the last weeks and no rescue vessels left â in the central Mediterranean,â Mattea Weihe, a Sea-Watch spokesperson, said. âHowever, the ship is not only a rescue asset, but also a strong political statement against Europeâs deadly politics. It is a huge 60.8-metre sign of solidarity, sent by over 500 organisations, of civil society, with the church in the front row.

In the second edition of her podcast, which aired on Wednesday, the former first lady reflected on the change her family and others have had to deal with as a result of the pandemic.  âI know that I am dealing with some form of low-grade depression,â she said. âNot just because of the quarantine, but because of the racial strife, and just seeing this administration, watching the hypocrisy of it, day in and day out, is dispiriting.â  Obama said her sleep has been affected and has been waking up in the middle of the night ââcause Iâm worrying about something, or thereâs a heavinessâ.

Obama said the Black Lives Matter protests and the continued unrest that has âplagued this countryâ have also affected her mood.  âI have to say, that waking up to the news, waking up to how this administration has or has not responded, waking up to, yet another, story of a Black man or a Black person somehow being dehumanised, or hurt or killed, or, falsely accused of something, it is exhausting. And, and it, it has led to a weight, that I havenât felt in my life, in, in a while,â she said.  Speaking to Washington Post columnist and former NPR host, Michelle Norris, the former first lady said during her familyâs time in the White House, which she described as being âoutside the norm of regular lifeâ, it was important for her to stick to a schedule. And itâs something she has used during the pandemic too, particularly in lockdown.  âBarackâs in his office, making calls, working on his book. Iâm in my room, the girls are on their computers,â she said. âBut right around five oâclock, everybody comes out of their nooks, and, we like, do an activity, like, puzzles have become big, just just sitting and doing these thousand piece puzzles.â  After dinner they play the card game âspadesââ, which former president Barack Obama taught his now-adult children, Malia, 22, and Sasha, 19.  âSo Barack has taught the girls spades, so now thereâs this vicious competition,â she said.  Asked if slowing down during the lockdown has been good for her children, Obama described it as an âunburdeningâ for them.  âItâs almost like they needed the world to stop a little bit. You know they didnât realise that they were, that the world they were on, and the way they were living it, was so treadmill-like. So fast and furious. Um, because it was all they ever knew.  She said the pandemic is also an opportunity to âdecide how you want to show up in the new world. Because it will be a new world.â  She said her greatest hope is that people reach for normal, âthat we reach for betterâ.  â¢ In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

Subsequent to the filmsâ release, both sisters came out as trans â Lilly in 2012 and Lana in 2016 â and some fans have since identified apparent resonances for the experience in the movies.  âIâm glad that it has gotten out that that was the original intention,â Lilly told Netflix Film Club on 4 August. âThe world wasnât quite ready for it. The corporate world wasnât ready for it.â  âI love how meaningful those films are to trans people,â she continued, âand the way they come up to me and say, âThese movies saved my life.ââ  Theories about the film have centred around the idea that the unease Keanu Reevesâs character, Neo, feels â described as âa splinter in your mindâ â represents a type of gender dysphoria. Therefore, the red pill he takes to see reality as it is could be seen as a hormone tablet.  Wachowski expressed some scepticism about the blatantness of such readings, saying: âI donât know how present my trans-ness was in my brain as we were writing it.â  But she said that her and her sisterâs identities did mean they readily embraced a mix of genres and an eagerness to explore âthe seemingly impossible becoming possibleâ, as well as being as inclusive as possible.  âI think it freed us up as film-makers because we were able imagine things that at that time you didnât necessarily see on screen.â  She also revealed that they had intended the character of Switch to be gender fluid, presenting as a man in apparent reality, and as a woman in the world of the Matrix.  âThe Matrix ... was all about the desire for transformation, but it was all coming from a closeted point of view,â Wachowski said.

Cases of the disease in the Lancashire city have doubled in a week, and Preston could follow in the footsteps of nearby east Lancashire, Greater Manchester and parts of West Yorkshire by reintroducing stringent lockdown rules.  Lancashire county councilâs director of public health, Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, expects stricter rules to be imposed in the city in the next few days, with residents already being asked to follow a number of extra measures to halt the spread of the virus.  Data from Public Health England show that the city recorded 49 new cases of Covid-19 in the week to 31 July, equating to almost 35 cases per 100,000 population, with 18 cases recorded in one day alone.  It was the second biggest increase in cases behind Blackburn with Darwen, which recorded 119 new cases.  Karunanithi told BBC Radio Lancashire he expected the government to impose restrictions âin the next few daysâ. âThat is my personal and professional opinion, given the statistics, the direction of travel and given the size of the issue,â he said.  Further updates on possible measures are expected on Thursday after a government meeting to discuss local authorities, Karunanithi said. âWe will get to know after that meeting if there are any restrictions that will be brought in or [if] any support will be given to us as well.â  Preston was not included in the official measures enforced by central government, but residents have been advised to take extra precautions.

The Robert Koch Institute, the main public health advisory body, has registered 1,045 new cases in the past 24 hours. The country now has 8,700 active cases.  The increase coincides with the return of hundreds of thousands of Germans from their summer holidays, often from high risk areas, as well as with the start of the school year in several of the 16 states.  The health minister, Jens Spahn, has held an emergency press conference in Berlin to address the concerns. He said:  Weâre not living in normal times. The pandemic is still there - it will continue to be there.  Spahn said he believed many Germans had been lulled into a false sense of security, âhaving a deceptive feeling that itâs not all that badâ and had relaxed their behaviour accordingly.  Dealing with the virus was a daily challenge for everyone. âEvery day we must find the balance between safety and trying to deal with day to day life,â he said.  Spahn stressed he was determined that schools and nurseries should not be affected in case the infection rate continued to rise. He said it was far more likely that there would be tighter restrictions on gatherings - including on their size and type, but did not foresee the closure of shops.  German health minister Jens Spahn has warned that it may become harder to control the virus spread in autumn. Photograph: Clemens Bilan/EPA  While the return of Germans from their holidays is increasingly contributing to the rise in new cases, far more prevalent in the statistics were domestic events, he said.  Family parties, religious celebrations and work environments, such as meat processing plants, have been responsible for small outbreaks across the country. Community facilities, such as care homes had also seen an increase in cases, he said.  Spahn has announced that obligatory tests for people returning from areas considered high risk by the RKI, currently numbered at around 130, will start at sea ports, airports and other border crossings, on Saturday. Those tested would be obliged to remain in quarantine until the test result was shown to be positive.  Health authorities could order a second test depending on where the person had travelled from.

The Guardian understands that officials at the Department for Transport (DfT) are finalising the announcement of the move but that the current plan is that measures are not due to come into effect until the weekend.  The government is expected to change Foreign Office guidance, which issues travel advice separately, for Belgium at the same time.  Belgium, which has endured one of the highest per capita coronavirus death rates in the world with more than 9,800 fatalities out of a population of about 11 million, announced a series of further restrictive measures last month to curb the spread of the virus. It has suffered a resurgence of the virus, with the country passing 70,000 Covid-19 cases this week.  Luxembourg was last week restored to the list of countries requiring travellers to quarantine for 14 days when they arrive in England because of a surge in coronavirus cases in the country, six days after the same demand was reimposed on arrivals from Spain, prompting chaos for holidaymakers.  The Daily Mail reported that ministers met on Wednesday to sign off the move to impose restrictions on arrivals from Belgium, with measures due to come into force at midnight or on Thursday.  However, the Guardian understands that the DfT initially planned to impose restrictions on arrivals from Belgium from the early hours of Tuesday but amid fast-moving developments behind the scenes, plans have since been moved forward meaning they are likely to come into effect from Sunday. It was not immediately clear why there is to be a delay in the imposition of the measures. The DfT provided no comment when asked by the Guardian about the plans.  Germany this week added Belgiumâs Antwerp province, in the north of the country, to its list of Covid-19 risk zones requiring travellers arriving from the region to quarantine for 14 days unless they can produce a negative coronavirus test.  On Wednesday, 225 staff were sent home to quarantine at one of Belgiumâs biggest meat processing plants, Westvlees, after the emergence of a cluster of Covid-19 cases. Reports said 18 staff at the plant, in West Flanders, tested positive for the disease.  On 27 July, Belgium unveiled new restrictive measures to stem the spread of the virus and prevent a return to nationwide lockdown. The prime minister, Sophie WilmÃ¨s, announced from 29 July, a family or household would only be able to meet five other people, down from 15. Meanwhile, the numbers allowed to attend public events inside were halved to 100 inside and 200 outside.

Surgical or examination masks intended to reduce or prevent the transmission of disease are considered medical devices, are regulated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and must be included in the register of therapeutic goods before they can be supplied.  As of Thursday, 286 types of mask had been removed from the register as part of a post-market review triggered by concerns that many masks do not meet regulatory standards and, if used in medical environments, may increase disease spread.  The TGA said of one supplier that the âsingle use surgical masks have not provided sufficient evidence to show compliance â¦ Continued use of these particular surgical masks may increase the risk of spreading infections (including Covid-19) between individuals.â  A face mask may be cancelled from the register in two ways: the sponsor (the supplier within Australia) may voluntarily cancel the entry or the TGA may cancel it.  Victorian nurses ask for urgent PPE as more than 730 health workers sick with Covid-19 Read more  Those products voluntarily cancelled by the supplier are not necessarily subject to a recall action because they failed to meet appropriate manufacturing standards or that they failed to perform as intended. Most products were cancelled by the supplier.  The news comes after Guardian Australia was sent images from nurses working in Victorian and New South Wales hospitals of masks and surgical gowns they were supplied with carrying labels in Chinese characters that stated âSingle-use protective masks (not for medical use)â and âDisposable not for medical use isolation gownâ.  While other languages can also be used on masks on the register, they must also contain labels, packaging and instructions for use in English.  Guardian Australia has contacted the federal Department of Health and the TGA for comment.  The president of the Australian Medical Associationâs New South Wales branch, Dr Danielle McMullens, said all personal protective equipment provided to healthcare workers should, at a minimum, meet regulatory standards and be made for medical use.  âAMA New South Wales has called on both the state and federal governments to ensure that there are zero healthcare worker deaths from Covid-19,â she said. âProviding them with sufficient PPE [personal protective equipment] that is of sufficient quality is vital to pursuit of this goal.â  A spokeswoman for the NSW department of health told Guardian Australia that in July, the department discovered âa small setâ of personal protective equipment gowns were labelled as ânot for medical useâ. Each local health district was contacted and asked to remove the gowns while their suitability was checked.  An expert infection control team âsubsequently found these specific gowns were suitable for clinical use in a medical setting,â the spokeswoman said. âNSW Health has a sufficient supply of PPE and health facilities are provided with clinically appropriate replacements to ensure they can retain adequate supply for their ongoing requirements.â  On Tuesday Guardian Australia reported that nurses had written to the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, asking to âurgently know whatâs being done to protect and care for Victorian nursesâ as more than 800 health workers in the state remain sick with active infections of Covid-19. The letter to the premier, seen by Guardian Australia, states âthe situation is still inadequate months after the outbreak startedâ. At least three Victorian health workers are in intensive care.  Jill Tayler is the founder of Global Health Workz, which supplies and imports PPE such as masks and gowns. She said she had been in contact with a number of nurses working in hospital wards with Covid-19 patients.  âThey tell me they are not being given the correct PPE,â she said. âThe masks are not even hospital grade or fluid resistant, and neither are the gowns.  âThe nurses are scared to speak out and are concerned about the ramifications of being a whistleblower. They are not allowed to provide their own PPE.  âA friend who works at a major hospital in reception at radiology tells me she is not allowed to wear a mask or face shield and yet patients lean across the counter to speak to her. There are no perspex screens in place.â  A senior nurse who has been in the profession for 25 years and is part of a chat group of more than 200 nurses treating Covid patients said that in the past fortnight, large deliveries of masks had been made to hospitals but many of those had unclear labelling and were not appropriate for use in hospitals. She said there were also differences in standards between hospitals. Some major tertiary hospitals were providing nurses with similar standards of protection to doctors and surgeons, while other hospitals were telling some nurses they were âlow riskâ even if they were swabbing potentially positive Covid-19 patients.  âWe are not saying the governments arenât doing anything,â she said. âThe supplies are getting better. But where are they procuring these masks from? Why arenât they meeting standards?â  More than 1,100 Victorian healthcare workers have contracted Covid overall, including active and non-active cases.

A new wave of first-time campers are pimping their pitches with portable firepits and comfy airbeds as camping enjoys a revival in tandem with the UK staycation boom.  Despite doom and gloom on much of the high street and the cancellation of the music festival season, retailers say shoppers have been snapping up tents, sleeping bags and cooking equipment, with many camping staples selling out.  The UKâs largest retailer, Tesco, said sales of camping equipment remained strong despite people being unable to go to festivals. âCamping chairs are by far the most popular item, with sales well ahead of this time last year, while tents and airbeds have steadily increased in popularity over the past few weeks and ponchos and inflatable pillows also seeing strong growth,â a spokesman said.  At Halfords, sales of tent pegs are up by 45%, airbeds by 130%, gas stoves by 300%, cool boxes by 180% and camping chairs by 120% since lockdown measures were lifted in England in early July. Roofbox sales have soared by 165% and bike racks are selling at a record rate, suggesting cars and bikes will be put to more use this summer. Even sales of leisure batteries â used in caravans, motorhomes and boats â are up by 36% year on year.  âAs we head into peak holiday season weâve seen demand surge for everything from rooftop boxes to camping chairs as customers ensure they can take everything they need with them for their touring and camping staycations this summer,â said David Howells, of Halfords. âWe have also seen extraordinary sales of bike racks, suggesting that UK consumers plan to continue their newfound fondness of cycling whilst on holiday.â  John Lewis said camping equipment sales for the period from February to July were up by 58% compared with last year, with tent sales up by 34%. Sales of firepits have more than tripled and most models have sold out.  The independent price comparison service PriceSpy reported that sales of tents were up 126%, sleeping mats 86%, sleeping bags 25% and thermos flasks 49% between June and July.  âWeâve booked the campsite but still have no tentâ  Among readers who responded to a callout by the Guardian was 48-year-old Kathryn, whose first-time camping plans didnât get very far. âOn Saturday night, my husband and I, who are seasoned long-haul travellers, made an impulsive decision to spend the best part of Â£1,000 on everything our little family would need to camp,â she said. âWeâre both police detectives, so we spent hours interviewing friends and family, and even had a spreadsheet.  âWe ordered everything from the tent to the spare pegs, the airbeds to the camping stove, the head torches to the she-wee, the sleeping bags to the rubber mallets.â  The family booked a campsite for the upcoming bank holiday and awaited their order. But on Tuesday they received an email from the store saying one item was missing â the tent.  âIt was totally frustrating, but really funny,â she said. âEverywhere else is sold out, I think due to the demand from coronavirus. Weâve already booked the campsite but still have no tent. Iâm so cross Iâm going to return all 32 of the other items.â  Ellen, 23, a care home administrator, recently went on her first camping trip with her boyfriend, and said they had âfallen in loveâ with camping.  âWe decided to take the plunge and go, as the idea of a foreign holiday was out of the picture and having spent most of lockdown apart we wanted to have a weekend away together,â she said.  For a couple who âlove an overseas adventure and a bit of luxury,â they have found an unlikely passion and have already rebooked for five weeksâ time.  âWe decided a three-night trip would be a good starting point,â she said. âWe also managed to pick the hottest weekend of the year, which apart from it being a bit sweaty in the tent was amazing. We felt like we had all the gear and no idea but by the end we felt like pros.â  A spokesman for the Camping and Caravanning Club, which represents 1,400 campsites across the UK, said recruitment of new members was up 55% during one week in July compared with the same time last year.  Rebecca Bebbington, from the money saving website NetVoucherCodes.co.uk, advises new campers to borrow or buy second-hand items rather than shelling out on new ones, and to camp out of season where possible. âThousands of families are looking at how they can salvage summer fun without breaking the bankâ she commented. âBut itâs surprisingly easy for costs to spiral.â",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/06/uk-staycation-boom-lifts-sales-of-camping-gear,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,b861d39979a6fd045fe259439559aa9d7f9dbe9e4f8285b6de39d4be0abb5829,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The broadcaster, which has scrapped paying an interim dividend to fortify its balance sheet, reported a 50% fall in adjusted profits to Â£165m in the first half. The company said advertising revenues fell 21% in the first six months, a drop of Â£178m to Â£671m, including a 43% decline in the second quarter.  Carolyn McCall, the chief executive of ITV, said that while the worst was over, the ongoing uncertainty in the market meant the company would not issue performance guidance for the remainder of this year.  âThis has been one of the most challenging times in the history of ITV,â she said. âWhile our two main sources of revenue â production and advertising â were down significantly in the first half of the year and the outlook remains uncertain, today we are seeing an upward trajectory with productions restarting and advertisers returning.â  The broadcaster said advertising revenue significantly improved in July, down 23% year on year. Analysts estimate August and September will drop below a 20% decline.  ITV Studios, which makes shows ranging from Coronation Street to Love Island, has now restarted 70% of the 230 shows put on hold as the pandemic shut down film and TV production across the UK. ITV Studios reported a 17% fall in revenues to Â£630m in the first half.

With stage four of the governmentâs roadmap to reopening indoor venues now delayed until 15 August at the earliest, itâs open air theatre season. This summer, a range of companies are putting on socially distanced productions to be enjoyed in the sunshine or under the stars.  Cirencesterâs Barn theatre was quick off the mark to launch BarnFest, offering comedy, cabaret, circus and other performances with a family-friendly focus. The theatreâs artistic director, Iwan Lewis, says that when the government gave the go-ahead for outdoor performances, âwe jumped on it immediatelyâ.  The Barn is an unsubsidised charity without funding from local authorities or Arts Council England. After the coronavirus outbreak, it offered live online shows starring a local clown, Tweedy, whose run at BarnFest swiftly sold out. âWe had to get active,â says Lewis of the Barnâs blizzard of activity during the pandemic. âOtherwise the reality was that we werenât going to be open at the other side of this.â  âWe had to get activeâ ... Tweedy: Al Fresco! at BarnFest in Cirencester. Photograph: Eve Dunlop  The Barn has a small team which Lewis thinks has helped them adapt in a dynamic manner, especially when setting up an al fresco festival. âWe are next door to a wonderful organisation called Ingleside House. We said: âCan we use your gardens for outdoor theatre?â They kindly said yes. We said: âBy the way, we canât pay for it.ââ Their neighbours were happy to help and the Barn added another marquee to the existing one, giving them space for an audience of 120 compared with the theatreâs indoor capacity of 200. The response has been enthusiastic: âThereâs a need for people to get back to theatre,â says Lewis.  With uncertainty about when they can resume indoor performances, the future still looks perilous. Lewis worries that the governmentâs Â£1.57bn arts bailout will have given a false impression that theatres are now safe and may hinder donations from the public. The Barn is applying for grants and continuing to innovate and plan cautiously. âItâs unlikely that we would take the risk on a Built by Barn production [one of their inhouse creations, rather than a touring show] in our theatre space in 2020,â he says. âBut that doesnât spell disaster to me.â  The Barn had its second birthday amid the shutdown in March but Scoot theatre company, which will visit the Cirencester venue in late August, is even younger. The company was launched by actor Max Hutchinson at the start of summer, its name a tribute to his son who has just learned to use a scooter. Hutchinson hopes the name captures the energy of his group who are taking A Midsummer Nightâs Dream to UK cricket clubs. Their hour-long version gives the plot a cricket spin and is performed by six actor-musicians, including two real-life couples, which eases the problem of social distancing on stage. There will be specially designated squares for small audience groups to watch from. Making the safety precautions clear has been key to customer confidence says Hutchinson, who was a few weeks into a nine-month stint on The Woman in Black in the West End when theatres shut down in March.  Work has begun on the outdoor Sanctuary theatre by Soulton Hall in Shropshire. Photograph: Soulton Hall  A Midsummer Nightâs Dream, with its spellbinding imagery of the natural world, is a perennial outdoor favourite. Shropshire farmer Tim Ashton has enabled a production this September in an earthen amphitheatre beside the burial mound he recently created in the tradition of neolithic burial barrows. Ashton believes that a landscape takes on a different quality when people are remembered there; this striking setting may underscore both the threat of death that hangs over Hermia in the play and the charactersâ quest for harmony. Children are encouraged to dress as fairies for the family-friendly one-hour production.  Ashton decided to create the theatre, named The Sanctuary, when he saw how many local am-dram performances were being cancelled because of coronavirus. He was inspired by the story of Shakespeareâs troupe, The Kingâs Men, visiting Shropshire during the plague of 1603 to keep culture alive. âWe are honouring what they did,â he says. âWe are not the only generation to face this.â He hopes to set an example to his fellow farmers and others who may have spare outdoor space that they can offer for the arts, to be enjoyed by the community.  National Youth Theatre is planning two productions at The Sanctuary â a response to the climate crisis and a new version of Animal Farm. âIn the face of immense challenges and pressure to help restore our precious cultural offering we all have a responsibility to try and make theatre happen,â says Paul Roseby, NYTâs artistic director. âTim is leading that initiative quite literally from the ground up with his new earth amphitheatre.â  A performance at Willow Globe, a scaled-down version of Shakespeareâs Globe.

The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) and the accountancy firm KPMG said the number of people signing up to find temporary work rose in July at the fastest pace since records began in 1997.  The lobby group for the recruitment industry said the record increase in available candidates was largely driven by redundancies stemming from the pandemic, as rising numbers of companies across the country cut jobs.  For permanent staff, availability grew at the second fastest rate on record â with growth in the number of people looking for work in July only surpassed to November 2008 during the depths of the financial crisis.  The temporary staff availability index compiled by the REC surged to 85, up from 48.5 in February before the pandemic struck. A figure above 50 indicates a rise in available workers from the previous month.  It comes as employers across Britain are inundated with job applications, including a restaurant in Manchester receiving more than 1,000 applicants for a receptionist role and an All Bar One in Liverpool receiving more than 500 CVs for a single bar job.  Unemployment is beginning to climb as the government scales back its furlough wage subsidy scheme, while new job vacancies have collapsed during the pandemic as the British economy slides into the deepest recession for 300 years. According to the Institute for Employment Studies, as many as eight people are now claiming unemployment benefits for every job opening, compared to just 1.5 people per job in March before the pandemic struck.  Neil Carberry, chief executive of the REC, said: âThere are far fewer vacancies in the market than before March, and more people looking for jobs.

New Zealand has attained the status of one of the worldâs safest countries when it comes to the coronavirus; there is no known community transmission in the country and life has largely returned to normal. But with one eye on nations where the virus was once quashed before spiralling out of control again, officials and the government have changed their language in recent days in order to fight a new battle â this time against complacency.  âWe have to be absolutely on our toes,â Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealandâs top health official, said in a Radio New Zealand interview on Wednesday. âThatâs not just the health system â¦ itâs everybody.â  It has been 97 days since the last domestic case of Covid-19 was transmitted from an unknown source in New Zealand; all 24 diagnosed instances of the virus are among travellers returning to the country who are in quarantine at government-managed isolation hotels.

A strict lockdown of the country in March and April quashed the spread of the virus, with fewer than 1,500 cases confirmed and 22 deaths. All restrictions on daily life except border controls were lifted two months ago.

Ardern referred to the Australian state of Victoria, where border failures have led to a resurgence of community transmission, provoking the stateâs strictest lockdown yet.  âThey too had very low numbers for a number of days in June,â she said. âWe are dialling back up the Covid messaging in response to some behaviours weâre seeing in New Zealand.â  The message is people should wash their hands, stay home if sick, accept Covid-19 tests where offered â a survey of doctors showed 25% of those offered were declining the swabs â and use the government contact tracing app. Less than 13% of the countryâs population has downloaded it, according to official figures.  In the capital, Wellington, on Wednesday, even some people who had downloaded the app admitted that they werenât using it. It was hard to remember to do so with few reminders of Covid-19 in their daily lives, they said, and some did not want to believe there could be a resurgence of the virus in New Zealand.  âI was using it when I saw the codes at first but I havenât swiped it in ages,â says James Thompson. âItâs probably kind of that I forgot and kind of that it just doesnât seem that important now.â  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Health and safety signage during the reopening of the Te Papa museum in Wellington.

Calgary Zoo said in May that it planned to return Er Shun and Da Mao to China, after coronavirus disrupted bamboo supply lines, but on Tuesday the zoo announced that due to the pandemic, it was still unable to secure travel permits.  Canada's Calgary zoo to return two giant pandas after bamboo supply disruption Read more  Giant pandas consume 40kg of fresh bamboo daily and the plant comprises 99% of their diet â raising concerns about keeping the animals fed.  âOur No 1 concern is access to fresh bamboo on a daily basis,â said Greg Royer, chief operating officer of the Calgary Zoo. âWe canât live with no guarantee â¦ You canât say: we may be able to feed the pandas.â  The zoo is currently sourcing bamboo from the neighbouring province of British Columbia, but that source will stop being available in September.  Complicating matters further, the Chinese government has not facilitated the paperwork for relocating the pandas due to tightening import rules imposed during the pandemic and a lack of quarantine space, according to the zoo.  âWe believe the best and safest place for Er Shun and Da Mao is where bamboo is abundant and easy to access,â said the zooâs president and CEO, ClÃ©ment Lanthier, in a statement. âThe continued delays in international permitting are putting the health and welfare of these two beautiful giant pandas in jeopardy.â  The pandas arrived in the western Canadian city of Calgary in March 2018 from a zoo in Toronto as part of a 10-year agreement between Canada and China, which was to run through 2023.  Before the pandemic, the zoo sourced bamboo in China and was able to have it delivered âwithin 48 to 60 hoursâ of being harvested, said Royer. âWe never fed the pandas [bamboo] that was more than six or seven days old. Thatâs the kind of fresh they need.â  If the pandas are unable to be relocated to China, âit gets much more difficult and unpredictable,â Royer said.

More than 200 people tested positive for Covid-19 at the KP Textil factory, exposing the dire working conditions inside the countryâs maquila system of free trade zones. At the time of the outbreak, the factory was making masks for export to the US.  Human rights activists said that KP Textil, on the outskirts of Guatemala City, lacked adequate health and safety measures to prevent an outbreak, despite the management saying it had closed the factory on 12 May after the first case of Covid-19 was detected.  The following day, the factory denied full entry to inspectors from the health ministry and the Guatemalan Social Security Institute (IGGS) on the grounds that the premises were private property and that testing would interfere with production.  When an inspection went ahead on 14 May, 26 out of a sample of 32 workers tested positive for Covid-19. The local mayor, supported by the municipal court of San Miguel Petapa, shut the factory down indefinitely and declared a state of emergency in the municipality.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest 201 out of 900 workers at KP Textil tested positive for coronavirus. Photograph: Johan OrdÃ³Ã±ez/AFP via Getty Images  When all 900 workers were tested, 201 positive cases were reported. The virus outbreak went on to cause the death of at least one KP Textil garment worker.  In statements to the Guardian, Gap, American Eagle and Amazon said their suppliers had been issued with detailed guidance on Covid-19 preparedness and mitigation and they are committed to rigorous labour standards. American Eagle and Amazon expressed sympathy for the death of the garment worker. Amazon said it had launched an investigation.  Despite numerous approaches to KP Textil for comment, no one responded. The ministry for labour declined to comment.  But in a radio interview in May, Rolando Reyes, from KP Textil, said: âWe started taking measures from the beginning of March. We were among the first in adopting hygiene and safety protocols, implementing the use of masks, hand sanitiser and such things for all the workers.â  Luis Daniel Reyes, workersâ advocate for Guatemalaâs Human Rights Ombudsman, said: âKP Textil was the maquila flagship for the contagion. In Guatemala, the biggest and most numerous infections occurred there, at KP Textil.â  Mayor Mynor Morales, whose San Miguel Petapa constituency is one of the most densely populated in the country, said: âWhen we did the [first] testing we understood there was a world of infected people.  âWhen we closed KP Textil, everybody went home. We followed the route to their familiesâ¦ in fact, there were two deaths of relatives of people who work in the maquila.â  Maquila companies operate in free trade zones, where taxes and wages are kept deliberately low to attract foreign investment and multinational fashion brands. The zones are hubs for manufacturing industries exporting to North America.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest A worker is sprayed with disinfectant as he arrives for his shift at KP Textil. Photograph: Johan OrdÃ³Ã±ez/AFP/Getty Images  Across Central America, the Maquila Solidarity Network estimates that 390,000 people work in free trade zones, about 60,000 of them in Guatemala, where the workforce is nearly 60% women, typically aged between 15 and 35.  Despite the billions of dollars generated in the zones, Guatemalaâs garment workers have been left particularly vulnerable to coronavirus, and are unable to save for times of sickness or unemployment.  The minimum wage for the sector is 2,831 Quetzales (Â£330) a month, although unions report that some workers are paid as little as Â£181. The living wage in Guatemala is Â£680.  Only two maquilas in the country have trade unions as attempts to organise have been met with violence and dismissal. The pandemic has exposed the brutal conditions workers have to endure.  âIt has become a butchersâ shop for the poor maquiladora people,â said Luis Armando LÃ³pez, general secretary of the Central Guatemalan Workers Confederation (CGTG). Most maquilas have not followed health measures imposed by the government, he said, adding that workers are having to buy their own masks and hand sanitiser.  None of the workers approached by the Guardian would talk openly about their experiences.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Additional safety measures such as face masks and barriers have been introduced at the textile plant. Photograph: Johan OrdÃ³Ã±ez/AFP/Getty Images  âOut of fear, many workers donât denounce their employers,â LÃ³pez said.  Homero Fuentes, from local NGO Coverco, has documented conditions inside the maquilas since the virus appeared in Guatemala. He said of the 89 factories investigated in the country, just two had followed all the safety protocols.  Although clothing production was not classified an essential service, Guatemalaâs maquilas have been allowed to remain open since March with permission from the ministry of the economy.  Zulma CalderÃ³n, health inspector at Guatemalaâs Human Rights Ombudsman, said control measures should have been implemented around the factories ânot just as a control measure to identify cases and contacts, but also as a protective measure for the rest of the communityâ. But, she said: âThat did not happen. The country never had economic closure as such, and neither vigilance or control measures by the state or the ministry of labour.â  Stephen Wishart, Central America programme director at the Solidarity Centre, said government and factory owners must take responsibility for their workers, and so must the brands buying the products. âDuring Covid, the brands continued to put orders into these factories â the government wasnât doing anything to ensure that health and safety mechanisms were being enforced.â  KP Textil reopened on 9 July.

Ahead of the reopening, Morales said he had visited the factory and seen that KP Textil was âputting things in orderâ. âAfter what happened to them I hope they learned a very good lesson and it never happens again,â he said.

American Eagle said it takes seriously the questions raised about KP Textil and had been in regular communication with the factory over past few months. âKP Textil has taken a number of positive actions to address the concerns in cooperation with government authorities.â  Amazon said it has âprovided extra funding to help suppliers and their workers access helplines, purchase personal protective equipment, and receive health and safety training.

The man was outside the Bristol Omnibus Company. He told Hackett he was weeping because the company had told him he could not get an interview for a job there solely because he was black. Almost 60 years later, and despite all he has seen in his 92 years, it still sticks in Hackettâs throat â ânot because he was a Jamaican, or foreign, but because he was black. It is degrading.â  Hackett marched straight into the bus company to demand answers. He was, he says, âborn an activistâ and saw it as his duty to challenge racism whenever he saw it. Once in front of the manager, he made it clear he was not asking for black people to be treated equally â he was demanding it. The indignation and strength of his will ring in his voice as he remembers telling the boss: âIf he canât drive it, then the bus wonât be moving, will it?â  In the face of such resolve, the manager crumbled and promised to give the man an interview. Three years later, the two men met again: Hackett stepped on to a bus and saw the man behind the wheel (naturally, the ride was free). But it was far from a simple triumph â to get to this happy ending, Hackett had to take on not just one manager, but an entire bus company â and the structures that allowed an informal but devastating segregation to flourish in parts of the UK. It took a months-long boycott to finally overturn open discrimination.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest âNo bus came in and no bus came outâ ... Hackett and his organisation are honoured by a mural in the city. Photograph: Olumedia/The Guardian  At the time, the so-called âcolour barâ meant that ethnic minorities could legally be banned from housing, employment and public places. Prior to the Race Relations Act 1965, for instance, it was legal to hang signs saying âNo blacks, no Irish, no dogsâ in public places such as pubs. Until the Race Relations Act 1968, discrimination in housing and employment was not covered by anti-racism legislation.  Across the country, housing was the most routine area in which a colour bar was applied â which explained the concentration of minorities in inner cities, as these were the only homes available to them. But trade unions, employers, working menâs clubs and pubs exercised their right to discriminate against the black and Asian population. In 1965, Malcolm X visited Smethwick, near Birmingham, where the council was still refusing to rent houses to immigrants; in the previous yearâs general election, the Conservative candidate had won with the unofficial slogan: âIf you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Labour,â and crosses had been burned in front of peopleâs homes.  At the time, the Bristol Omnibus Company was notorious for racial discrimination in recruitment. Hackett says labourers from the colonies and former colonies were allowed to âwash the buses at nightâ, but barred from the better-paid work on the bus crews. This segregation was not only upheld by the bus company, but also vigorously defended by the local branch of the Transport and General Workersâ Union, which did not want its members to lose jobs to immigrants.  He was drawn to Britain by the promises of a better life made by none other than Enoch Powell  Hackett believes that underlying these economic fears was the even more insidious racist fear that white women would not be safe with black men working on the buses. Hackettâs neighbour told him he was tormented by his work colleagues because he lived next door to a black man. They told him to âgo home â your neighbour will be holding down your wifeâ, Hackett says.  The same neighbour also gave him the perfect example of the resentment that underpinned the colour bar one day as Hackett was washing his Vauxhall Cresta, his pride and joy. The neighbour marched over and started ranting at Hackett that it was not right for him to have a fancy car and own his own home âwhen you have just got hereâ. Hackett lets out a mischievous laugh at the memory, but at the time he simply reminded his neighbour that he had been struggling as an immigrant in Britain for years and that it was not his fault his neighbour could afford only a motorbike with a sidecar for his wife and child.  Hackett had grown up in Trench Town in Kingston, Jamaica, on the same 7th Street that was immortalised in the Bob Marley and the Wailers song Natty Dread. Despite working as an insurance broker, among other jobs, he had struggled as a young man to make enough money even to eat. Ironically, he says he was drawn to Britain by the promises of a better life made by none other than Enoch Powell â the man whose racist ârivers of bloodâ speech, delivered in 1968, warned of the danger of allowing immigrants into the country.  Before Powell became the foremost anti-immigrant MP of his generation, he was the health minister between 1960 and 1963, championing the recruitment of doctors and nurses from the Caribbean. Hackett insists Powell spoke at a meeting in Kingston that he attended (although this proved impossible to verify). The politician, says Hackett, was âtalking friendlyâ, encouraging people to migrate to a land of plenty with âloads of jobsâ. At the time, everyone thought Powell was a good man, says Hackett, shaking his head with a wry smile: âSon of a gun!â  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Never forget ... a plaque in Bristol bus station commemorates the boycott. Photograph: Olumedia/The Guardian  In 1952, Hackett travelled from Jamaica to the UK â by ship, because it was half the price of the plane journey. Bad weather forced a stop on the eastern seaboard of Canada. Hackett remembers watching a polar bear trying to steal some fish; undeterred, he tried to disembark, assuming they had arrived in England. Looking back, he laughs: âIf they drop me off there, it wouldnât make no difference â I just wouldnât have got my luggage.â  Instead, at the age of 24, he landed in Liverpool. He lived there for a time, before moving to London, Wolverhampton and finally Bristol.  âHousing was the biggest problem, because they was strictly against us,â says Hackett, who describes his early years in the UK as a âdogâs lifeâ, thanks to the difficulty of finding work and reasonable housing. On his first day in Bristol, in 1956, Hackett walked around the city looking for a boarding house. At each one he tried, he says, he was refused a room as soon as the owner saw he was black. He spent his first night sleeping in a doorway. A white passerby took pity on him and âjust come and throw an overcoat on meâ before walking off. Hackett took a crumb of comfort from this, he says, telling himself âitâs not all of them as bad as we thinkâ â although he could not help but wonder, even so, âif they think I had two other legs somewhere else â because they didnât talk to me as though I was a humanâ.  The success of the boycott â its size and the level of public support â added to the pressure to change the law  When eventually he found lodgings in the city, it was just one room â shared with his cousin and two other men. In the downstairs front room, there was a family with three children; every other room in the house was similarly overcrowded. They all shared a bath that was kept outside and dragged in once a week to be filled with water. The house, like every other that was available to immigrants, was in the inner city. Every morning, Hackett, who was working for the construction firm Robert McAlpine in Wales, had to rise at 4am to get to work on time.  When he did get the chance for leisure, he says, it was not safe for a lone black man, or a couple, to go into the city centre after dark. Violent racism meant there had to be a group of at least six or seven people if they were to be safe from assault by the local teddy boys. The police, Hackett says, always looked the other way.  In 1959, he married his childhood sweetheart, Ena, who arrived in Bristol in 1958, and they had a daughter. Hackett had an older daughter from a previous relationship in Jamaica; they both look out for him today. In Bristol, he helped found the Commonwealth Coordinated Committee, which is still running today as the Bristol West Indian Parents and Friends Association. The group challenged Bristol council, pressuring it to act on housing and employment. But its most important campaign was the bus boycott.

Photograph: Bristol Evening Post/BBC  Hackett never worked on the buses or had any intention of doing so (although his wife had been turned down for a job as a bus conductor). He got involved in the struggle âfor his countrymenâ, he says, because the bus service that they had to use every day served as a daily reminder of the racism in society. It was particularly galling because London Transport was not only hiring black people to work on buses in London, but also actively recruiting in the Caribbean.  Alongside four other men â Owen Henry, Audley Evans, Prince Brown and Paul Stephenson â Hackett marshalled the 3,000-strong Caribbean community into a boycott. The idea was partly inspired by the 1955 Montgomery action, in which Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat. Henry made the connection with African Americans having to sit at the âback of the busâ, which in the UK was where conductors stood. Stephenson set up a test case â arranging an interview for a man called Guy Bailey, to confirm there were vacancies. When he phoned back to tell the company that Bailey was black, the interview was cancelled.  After this, the boycott was announced at a press conference on 29 April 1963. It gained national attention as the first boycott of its kind in Britain. Hackett organised blockades of Fishponds Road, which ensured no buses could make it past their barrier and into the city centre. Hackettâs eyes flicker as he remembers the determination the campaigners felt: âNo bus came in and no bus came out.â  The Caribbean community arranged lifts between themselves to get to work, but support for the boycott was much more widespread â it included the local MP Tony Benn, students at the University of Bristol, anti-racist groups such as the Campaign Against Racial Discrimination and sympathetic members of the general public. Hackett remembers Benn as a genuine friend to the campaigners; he drank tea with the organisers and stood in the road alongside them. Even the Labour leader, Harold Wilson, backed them, wishing the protesters âall the successâ.  The group faced hostility, too, and threats of violence, but Hackett remembers how undeterred they felt: âWhat we started now we wonât stop until we get what we want.â  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Front and centre ... some Bristol residents have proposed installing a tribute to Hackett where the statue of Edward Colston once stood. Photograph: Ben Birchall/PA  It took months of disruption, but, finally, on 28 August â the day Martin Luther King gave his âI Have a Dreamâ speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC â the union and the company caved to the boycottersâ demands: the colour bar at the bus company was lifted.  The success of the boycott â its size and the level of public support â added to the pressure to change the law. Hackett is convinced that Bennâs influence was key in persuading the Wilson government to pass anti-racism legislation.  After the boycott, Hackett stayed very active in the community, that year founding the St Paulâs festival, which later became the St Paulâs carnival. Eventually, even the union honoured him, with a Roy Hackett Training Room in their offices: âIf you canât beat them, join them,â he says. His picture is a regular feature in local schools (as his grandson found out not long ago when he saw his grandad on the wall) and until recently he gave talks in schools about the boycott, his life and his experiences in Bristol. The children, he says, are always keen to know what life was like âback thenâ.  Today, he has retired from frontline activism, but his legacy in Bristol has not been forgotten. There have even been calls to replace the toppled statue of Edward Colston with a tribute to Hackett. âSo they can pull me down in 20 years?â he jokes. He still offers help to young activists â if they ask and he can âsit in the shadeâ. Seeing the Black Lives Matter protests gave him hope, he says, because he âwants the younger people to fight it. We fought for what we have now. Letâs push it further.â At 92, his body is starting to betray him, but the fire remains.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/06/roy-hackett-the-civil-rights-hero-who-stood-in-front-of-a-bus-and-changed-britain-for-ever,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,dc8a3e2dd35a96fdcc1fd83a8126384b88198dc098275e250fcfd090f3f5ddf8,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

When the longlist came out last week, Taylor tweeted a photograph from 2018, showing the manuscript of his longlisted novel Real Life, which follows a black, gay biochemist on a predominantly white graduate programme, alongside that of Zhangâs, How Much of These Hills Is Gold, about two orphaned Chinese-American immigrant children on the run in the American west.

We were at Bread Garden [in Iowa City], talking about our books, just going through and making sure that they still made sense. We looked over and weâre like: âOh, look at our our books, theyâre gonna be real things someday.â  How did you two meet?  Taylor: I remember very clearly, sitting down in the big open room in the Frank Conroy Reading Room at the Iowa Writers Workshop and Pam coming in and sitting next to me.  Zhang: I just remember feeling extremely overwhelmed by the number of people, so I kind of glommed on to Brandon.  Taylor: The number of times weâve sat in a diner for hours and talked over an Alice Munro story or a Lauren Groff story or a Shirley Jackson piece, or like a novel that we both read by coincidence.  Both novels make something new from long literary traditions â the campus novel; the western. Was that deliberate?  Zhang: Iâve always loved these epic tales of the American west, Laura Ingalls Wilder, John Steinbeck and Larry McMurtry, and having moved there with my family as a young child, and driven across the entire expanse of America, from east to west, there was something about that landscape that always spoke to me. But I didnât think of that consciously. I was living in Bangkok, and one day I woke up and I had this image of two children on the run and silver dollars and hills, and it just poured out of me like that.  My novel is really concerned with storytelling, with parsing what a dominant culture tells you, and with something that a lot of marginalised people can relate to: a lot of the lives of these two children are about looking through and past and under what the dominant narrative is telling you about how to move forward in the world. The rules do not apply. The rules are not the same. And I was really interested in that. I was having fun with it, but thereâs also a sense of defiance. I wanted to twist and turn things and put them on their head.  Iâm not the only queer black person whoâs felt estranged in these all-white spaces â it's a story for us Brandon Taylor  Taylor: I love stories set on campuses, because they are often where people are becoming who theyâre going to be for the rest of their lives.

Or if theyâre queer people, theyâre not queer people of colour.  So I decided this time, the central focus is going to be a black gay person. Iâm going to write a story for people like me, because I know that Iâm not alone in these all-white spaces. Iâm not the only queer black person whoâs felt estranged in these spaces, and Iâm going to write a story for us. And everyone whoâs felt lonely and isolated will finally have a book they can turn to, that speaks to them.  How much is the novel drawn from your own life?  Taylor: I started it while I was working in a research lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I was in a doctoral programme and I was writing little stories on the side. Iâd tried to write a novel before, but the process defeated me every single time because itâs a messy, strange process. So I tried to bring an analytical framework to it, and made a bunch of lists: What are the reasons Iâve failed to write a novel before? What are my strengths as a writer?  I thought, OK, Iâm going to take the surface of my actual life, and Iâm going to lift it out of reality and put it into fiction because that way, I wonât get bogged down in trying to invent a bunch of stuff, I can save my invention for where it really counts. And as the book went on, it became more and more fictional, it departed further and further from from my actual life.  Are the the experiences of racism drawn from real life?  Taylor: Most of it is stuff people said to me, almost to the letter. Because I didnât trust myself to invent that language faithfully. If I had just made that up, people would be like: âOh, people donât talk that way.â And it felt important to me to use the real idiom of racism and homophobia and classism, because then no one can say that.  Pam, youâve talked in the past about feeling very conscious of the white gaze in your stories.  Zhang: My first experience with writing fiction in a white, academic setting was as an undergraduate. I took a couple of fiction workshops, and itâs horrifying to me now to look back. I was writing all these imitation, middle class, white man stories. I was able to write nice sentences, but there was no heart, there was no soul in the story, and I was erasing myself as well.  After college, I wasnât writing much fiction. And then my father died, and that, combined with a dissatisfaction with the life that I was living, working in tech, led me to want to reconnect with that early part of myself. I took a break from my life in San Francisco and lived in Bangkok. It was a test for myself: letâs see if given all the time in the world to write, I will actually write.  Brandon, you said that you could have written a book that would have been more sympathetic to the white gaze, but it would have been a worse book. What did you mean?  Taylor: There are ways that Real Life is uncomfortable for white people to read. I knew that discomfort was there, and it was important to me that I preserve it. All the microaggressions that permeate the book could have not been included, and it would have been a more sympathetic book for the white gaze, but I didnât want to write a book like that. I didnât want to write a book that was entirely comfortable about these issues because they are deeply painful and when theyâre happening to you, you donât get to forget them and you donât get to move on from them right away, you have to sit with the humiliation of them.  Having the reader, regardless of their race, have to sit in Wallaceâs discomfort and humiliation was, to me, a really important force in the book. And so yeah, it could have been more sympathetic to the white gaze. It could have been more comfortable, but I think it would have been worse.  We tend to think that peopleâs lives were different in the past, but the emotional textures of our lives has always been the same C Pam Zhang  Pam, the topics you tackle in your novel â gender identity, immigration, the American dream â feel so current: why set it in the past?  Zhang: I didnât think of taking contemporary issues and copy pasting them into the past. It just felt inherent to these characters and the way their lives are lived. Often when we look back into historical periods, we tend to think that peopleâs lives were so different. But I think the emotional texture and fabric of peopleâs lives has always been the same. Maybe we talk about it more now, or we have better language for talking about sexism and racism and gender nonconformism, but those people have always existed and dealt with those issues. Theyâve just been so marginalised that they donât rise to the surface of written texts or history books.  What was it like writing a gender nonconforming character like Sam in a time when there wasnât the language for expressing that?  Zhang: It was a difficult line for me to walk as a writer because most of the novel is seen through Lucyâs eyes. And Lucy herself struggles with seeing Sam accurately and clearly, and has some problematic views of her own. So it was hard because the me living in 2020 obviously has one vocabulary for speaking about gender, and I have my own views, but it didnât feel right to just force those views into the novel and have everyone suddenly able to be 100% correct in gendering Sam. I had to walk that line between what was right for the world as a novel and the characters, and my own views. The one thing I could do for Sam was in the first 15 or 16 pages of the novel, there are no gendered pronouns. Because I, as the writer, wanted to give them the chance to present as themselves fully, before the views of the world are forced on them. That was really, really important to me.  Both novels deal with grief and alienation  Zhang: Brandon and I realised, after we read each otherâs novels, that both of our books start with the death of a father. Stylistically if you opened up a page of Brandonâs novel at random and a page of my novel at random you would not think there were many connections, but I feel like deep down under everything, under style, under sentence choice, under structure, our novels are very interested at the heart in similar emotional questions. Something Brandon and I talk about a lot, not just in our work, but in works that we love, is how weâre both interested in exploring what it means to feel like an alien in a human body.  Taylor: If aliens were to come to earth and to pick up Pamâs work or my work, they would just think that humans were intensely uncomfortable all the time with the state of being a human. Pam and I often say that weâre like tiny little robots rattling in human cages, because weâre constantly baffled by how people just know how to be a person, they donât seem to have to think about it all. And weâre over here just intensely just trying to figure out how to be in a conversation.",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/06/two-friends-both-up-for-the-booker-prize-we-are-exploring-what-it-means-to-feel-alien,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,b1affae6ddcf87342c516700f11a21389944e09324b591086a8b6aecae458e79,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

He laughs as he recalls the incident. âLook how thin Iâve become, I weigh only 57 kilos,â he says. The 21-year-old Palestinian shows his skinny 5ft 7in frame over the webcam.  He speaks in Swedish mixed with Norwegian expressions â his capacity in both languages is testament to the nearly five years spent between the countries as an adolescent. They were formative years, where he learned that even apparently kind gestures such as the offer of a place to stay could open the door to unfathomable cruelty.  It was a time when no matter what Rahman suffered, the legal right to remain in Europe eluded him. His lack of status enabled appalling crimes to be committed against him, and it left the criminals unpunished. He has been exploited and deported but his dream of Europe endures. He has found his way back to the continent but the future is uncertain.  Q&A Who are Europe's dreamers? Show Hide Dreamers is the US term collectively given to young people without legal immigration status who were brought to the US as children. Some young people living in Europe without legal status now also call themselves 'dreamers' because their struggle against hostile European migration and asylum policies echoes the US campaign. Between 3.9 and 4.8 million people in Europe are believed to be living without residency permits, about 65% of whom are under 35 years old, according to the Pew Research Center. In the UK, a recent University of Wolverhampton study commissioned by the mayor of London estimated there are 332,000 children and young people living undocumented in the UK, including 106,000 children born in the country. Estimating numbers of undocumented people necessarily involves guesswork â and the methodologies are often criticised â but it is thought there are millions of dreamers across Europe.    In October 2013, 15-year-old Rahman arrived in Sweden alone. Like so many other young refugees, he had heard good things about Sweden: children are protected, they get to attend school and feel safe, their rights are respected and almost all get to stay.  He grew up in Jordan, his Palestinian parents refugees from Gaza. Jordanâs citizenship laws had no place for Rahman, leaving him stateless. When the war in Syria was in its third year, his father wanted to send him across the border to fight the Syrian regime. His mother disagreed and the teenager fled to what she hoped would be a place of safety.  In Sweden, Rahman lived in a refugee shelter, started school and quickly learned the language. He played football in his spare time. But despite his young age and troubles in Jordan, the court of migration in Stockholm rejected his asylum application in the summer of 2014.  With no idea of what to do, Rahman left the youth hostel in Stockholm to avoid being deported, and cut off contact with his state-appointed guardian.  That is when he met Martin: a man in his 30s, with a shaved head and heavy gold chains around his neck. Once Martin understood Rahmanâs situation, he invited him to a flat in central Stockholm.  I had nowhere to go. No money. And there was no one to help me  When he got there Rahman was shocked. Some people were sniffing glue, others were using cocaine. He was given a drink â his first taste of alcohol. The night became a haze. Martin took him into a room. Rahman was struck to the ground and felt hands on his body.  The rapes and beatings continued for months. Martin threatened to kill him if he tried to run away. Rahman had seen guns and knives around the flat and did not dare argue or ask questions. âI had nowhere to go. No money. And there was no one to help me,â he says.  A lot of people came to the flat, and it was Rahmanâs job to keep it clean. He was given takeaway food and drugs. Martin would call at any hour and send him off with a bag and address to deliver it to. He was sent on drug trips across Europe, for which he was given new clothes, a fake passport and a bag to carry. Rahman, usually on drugs, slept through the flights.  He is among thousands of children who have come to Sweden in recent years only to go missing when their European dreams are shattered. According to the Swedish migration agency, 2,014 unaccompanied minors are missing without trace since 2013 â equivalent to almost 70 school classes. The threat of deportation is often mentioned as a reason for these disappearances, as is human trafficking.  But no one really knows, because no one is searching for them. The police keep records but often do not actively search for the children. Municipalities say children no longer resident in their area are not their responsibility. The migration agency says it cannot examine the cases of missing children. In 2016, the UN human rights committee criticised Sweden for failing to prevent these disappearances.  Many, like Rahman, are vulnerable to abuse and traffickers. According to a 2015 survey by a Swedish government agency, most suspected child trafficking cases involved unaccompanied minors. At that time, no trafficking investigations involving unaccompanied minors had resulted in a prosecution.  To understand where the system was failing, I researched every suspected case of trafficking of minors in Sweden during a four-year period up to 2015. According to police reports and preliminary investigations, more than half of the cases involved sexual slavery, in which nearly half of the victims were boys. The policeâs failed response to trafficking was systemic.  Rahman was one of those cases. I tracked him down in Norway. After several months, he had managed to escape Martin. On reaching Norway, he again applied for asylum and reported his experience of trafficking to authorities. Rahman and his lawyer felt the authorities did not take his case seriously. Because the alleged trafficking took place in Sweden, Norwegian police passed the investigation to their Swedish colleagues. Rahman did not trust the investigators in either country. They did not seem to realise how dangerous it would be for him to single out Martin with no witness protection.  Shortly after Rahman turned 18, we spent a few days at a seaside resort. Surrounded by glittering Norwegian fjords, he and his court-appointed guardian sat outside on a mild summer evening. He leaned against her with his big ragged hair and gentle smile. âSheâs like a mother to me,â he said.  The Swedish trafficking investigation was eventually dropped. His asylum application in Norway was also rejected. Now 18, he was no longer technically a child. In the summer of 2018, he was deported to Jordan.  After nearly five years in Europe, Rahman struggled with the more socially controlled society in Jordan. He could not return to his strictly religious family: he now smoked, drank alcohol and wore an earring. Without a Jordanian ID, he had no access to medical care or hope of returning to education.  The police seemed to relish harassing him. They would ask: why were you in Europe? Why have you come back? He was even mocked by friends and relatives: whereâs the money, the success, the expensive things? For a while he worked 12-hour days at a tourist bazaar for wages that did not cover his rent. After a few weeks he decided to leave again.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Refugees arrive on Lesbos after crossing the Aegean from Turkey on an inflatable boat. Photograph: Matej Divizna/Getty Images  First he attempted to sail to Greece via Turkey but the yellow dinghy was stopped by Turkish coastguards. After a month and a half in a Turkish prison, he returned to Jordan. He had a Norwegian girlfriend at the time. As a European, she could come to visit for a few weeks. Rahman has none of these options.  I canât build a life here. I want to go to Europe again. I am never giving up  His friends in Norway arranged for him to stay with people they knew in Kosovo and he planned to continue overland further into Europe. But he was arrested in Montenegro and sent back to Kosovo. He became severely ill and returned to Jordan. But he was already making new plans to reach Europe.  âI canât build a life here,â he said in the summer of 2019. âI want to go to Europe again. I am never giving up.â  This time he went to Morocco. Rahman knew this was his most dangerous journey so far. âBut I am going to make it, I am sure of it,â he insisted. Later that summer, he reached the Moroccan border with the Spanish enclave of Melilla.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest People on the border fence separating Morocco from the north African Spanish enclave of Melilla. Photograph: Blasco de Avellaneda/AFP/Getty Images  This gateway to Europe is marked with high razor wire fences and monitored by drones. Migrants and Moroccan boys his age were everywhere, hoping to get through the border at night. Some had been trying for months, even years. Rahmanâs plan was to swim around the sea fences, a treacherous feat as border guards sometimes fire plastic bullets at swimmers. His first four attempts failed and he was hurt in a fall before he finally managed to swim into the port of Melilla.  âI am so happy â I am in Europe again!â he said in a message.  Afraid of being forced back to Morocco, he stowed away onboard a cargo ship to mainland Spain. He was given a place in a refugee shelter and â¬50 a month to live on. But this assistance was cut after six months, just as the coronavirus pandemic hit Europe.  As we kept in touch over the years, I would always ask how he was and he always replied: âGood,â no matter the circumstances. He has to stay positive, he says, to keep going towards what he longs for: an ordinary life, with a home. He would like to study languages and maybe work with tourists as he is so used to meeting new people.  But there is little space to talk about the future right now. Rahman does not even know what tomorrow will bring, where he will sleep or how he will eat. He is considering two unwanted options: start selling drugs again or commit a crime deliberately to get caught. âIf I get arrested, I have somewhere to live until corona is over,â he said.  Rahmanâs European dream has brought him back. Despite the trials he has gone through, the stateless boy is now a young man but no closer to having papers. The asylum process in Spain is long, up to 18 months, and uncertain â and that was before the pandemic. He thinks of Sweden or Norway but doubts his chances. From Scandinavia to Jordan, he has never been granted the right to belong. âWhy is that?â he asks. âWhy canât I be legal anywhere?â  Rahmanâs name has been changed and his photograph in the main image obscured to protect his identity.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/06/why-cant-i-be-legal-anywhere-exploited-and-left-stateless-by-sweden,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,65379cb33552cc2dd302bc2bf7800850f10fca89ee03980fe3623822fd8f65bd,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Marlene Dietrich in Stage Fright (1950)  A classic role of elegant, sophisticated malice and brazen wrongdoing for Marlene Dietrich as Charlotte Inwood, a fashionable star of the West End musical stage who appears to have murdered her husband, and is planning to frame her lover Jonathan, an actor whom she is cynically using. But a sweet-natured, struggling young actress called Eve is falling in love with Jonathan, and wants to help him. Using her acting skills, she poses as a maid and insinuates herself into the employ of smoky-voiced Charlotte, to spy on her.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Marlene Dietrich in Stage Fright, 1950. Photograph: Allstar Collection/Cinetext/WARN/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar  9. Juliette Binoche in The Clouds of Sils Maria (2014)  The All About Eve template recurs in movies about actresses â and Juliette Binoche riffs on it with accomplished skill in this movie from Olivier Assayas. She plays Maria Enders, a movie star who lives a cushioned life of international luxury. Having made her name as a young woman in a gay drama, she is now being cajoled into doing a remake, only this time playing the cynical older lover. But her personal dynamic is more in her friendship â or relationship â with her personal assistant, played by Kristen Stewart, with whom she has a spirited debate about whether superhero movies are worthwhile.  8. Deepika Padukone in Om Shanti Om (2007)  Deepika Padukone made a dazzling debut in this bold, fantasy romantic adventure about reincarnation. She plays Shanti, a 70s Bollywood actress who is killed in a fire, deliberately set by a vengeful, unbalanced producer to whom she was secretly married and whose child she was expecting. Shah Rukh Khan plays a humble movie extra who is hopelessly in love with her from afar, and dies trying to rescue her from the blaze. Thirty years later, he is reincarnated as a famous actor who is plagued with an inexplicable fear of fire and obsessed with visions of Shanti and auditions thousands of hopefuls to be his leading lady and finds an exact duplicate of the woman of his dreams â played again by Padukone.  7. Meryl Streep in Postcards from the Edge (1990)  Meryl Streep plays Suzanne Vale, a young movie actress whose substance abuse is madly out of control, in this comedy based on the autobiographical novel by Carrie Fisher. Having not really dealt with her problems with cocaine and prescription drugs, Vale finds that the insurance company will only cover her next picture if she lives with a responsible adult â and the only one available is her outrageously difficult mother, herself a veteran star, played by Shirley MacLaine. (Fisherâs own mother was Debbie Fisher.) The film is candid about the anxieties and banalities of the movie business and engagingly funny about growing up with a famous movie mum.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ayako Wakao in Floating Weeds. Photograph: TCD/Prod.DB/Alamy Stock Photo  6. Ayako Wakao in Floating Weeds (1959)  YasujirÅ Ozuâs Floating Weeds is a delicate tragicomedy of manners and misadventures about a travelling company of actors. Ayako Wakao plays Kayo, a young actress in the troupe who unwittingly becomes involved in a plot driven by sexual jealousy. The lead actress of the group cajoles and bribes young Kayo into seducing a young man in the town where they happen at that moment to be playing. This is due to pure spite, because this young man is the (unacknowledged) son of the troupeâs male star, with whom the older actress is having an affair and who had a relationship with a local woman here, decades before, and appears still to be infatuated with her. Inevitably, Kayo falls in love with her young man.  5. Judy Garland in A Star Is Born (1954)  A Star Is Born has been born four times, but this has to be the best version, with Judy Garland as Esther Blodgett, the wannabe actress who rises to movie greatness with a new stage name â Vicki Lester â under the gallant tutelage of a boozing and psychologically unstable star, Norman Maine, played by James Mason. They marry, but Normanâs career wanes just as hers soars, and she is deeply concerned at his angry depression, his drinking and the damage to his fragile male ego. A Star Is Born became part of Garlandâs mythology (in real life, it was Mason who was concerned about Garlandâs drinking) and her wide-eyed vulnerability and passion assumed a new intensity in the persona of a fictional movie star.  4. Bette Davis in All About Eve (1950)  For many, All About Eve is the classic female star myth, replete with paranoia, unsisterly scheming and duplicitous cunning. Bette Davis is Margo, a star of the Broadway stage who is approaching middle-age and perhaps worried that her best years are behind her. A lovely, apparently innocent and obliging young fan with the evil-temptress name of Eve (played by Anne Baxter) impresses Margo when they meet backstage, gets herself hired as her personal secretary and soon makes herself indispensable to Margo; but she is a would-be actress, a cuckoo-in the-nest who wants Margoâs career. Davis is very stylish as the disillusioned star whose vulnerability is revealed in this backstage manoeuvring.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Helena Howard in Madelineâs Madeline.

Helena Howard in Madelineâs Madeline (2018)  At 20, Helena Howard made a stunning debut in this movie about emotional development and theatrical performance, devised through improvisation under the control of director Josephine Decker. She plays emotionally troubled teenager Madeline who joins an experimental theatre company which (like the film) uses improv. Through her sheer passionate commitment and instinctive engagement, Madeline becomes their biggest star, due to her absolute lack of inhibition. But Madeline is only just recovering from an episode that landed her in a psychiatric hospital; now the company is planning to devise a whole new improvised show all about her psychological problems. Will this tip her back over the edge? An amazing study of an acting life in the 21st century.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard. Photograph: Ronald Grant  2. Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard (1950)  Like Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, Gloria Swanson embraced a late-career phase of playing self-aware terrifying dragons and this was probably the greatest of all. She is Norma Desmond, once a star of the silent screen who has now been utterly forgotten and lives a grim Miss-Havisham-like existence in her mouldering mansion. William Holden plays a failing screenwriter who blunders on to her property one night, and finds himself hired as a supposed âscript doctorâ for her self-penned delusional comeback vehicle and as her general factotum, companion and flatterer â finding that writers are lower than everyone in Hollywood. Her butler, Max, is played by Erich von Stroheim, a brilliant silent movie director in real life and so exquisitely cast. Swansonâs Norma has imperious statements about how pathetic the modern movie business is, how lacking in its old mythic grandeur (âIâm still big, itâs the pictures that got small.â) and possesses a tragicomic magnificence.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Gena Rowland with Ben Gazzara and John Cassavetes in Opening Night. Photograph: Allstar/FACES DIST.  1. Gena Rowlands in Opening Night (1977)  This film from director John Cassavetes, with its wonderfully moving and intelligent performance from Gena Rowlands, is another meditation on the All About Eve parable of the stage actress confronting the passing of youth. But it shows that this theme can be presented as an emotionally generous drama, and not as a black-comic hysterical cat-fight. Rowlands plays Myrtle, who is doing out-of-town previews for a play in which, for the first time, she is playing an older character. Mobbed by autograph-hunters after the show, Myrtle is deeply shocked when a troubled teen fan who is eerily similar to her own younger image, recklessly flings herself at her departing limo and is killed. This event triggers a breakdown that manifests itself in unstable behaviour onstage and her various colleagues, lovers, ex-lovers, friends and backers are unsure how to handle it â all having a lot riding on this show. Myrtle is scared that if she does too well playing the older woman, then that is what she must resign herself to being, in art and in life. This film about a troubled actress shows that these ideas are not simply about vanity, or competition; they are the occasion for a profound, existential meditation on love, friendship, sexual politics and the phases of mortality.",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/06/actresses-playing-actresses-in-film-ranked,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,a28429d31e0fbd739d9d189d2ca8fa70a4cc20b90f327ae7f34893b9e4e086b7,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Many of us watch it without a television. Just as most of us listen to the radio without a radio. We read, but sometimes it is by way of an icon of a book on a screen (there is a term for nods to old formats in design; skeuomorphism).  The water-cooler gossip over last nightâs TV belongs to a different era. But, due to the coronavirus pandemic, even six months ago was a different era. We have been going to the theatre via YouTube; visiting galleries on Street View. We have had to adapt and adjust to appreciate art.  One thing that has managed to bind households together, however physically separate, has been a reversion to water-cooler moments. A term that described office workers, or kids in school, discussing the previous nightâs event television is now repurposed for the digital era. The habit we have fallen into since is binge-watching online, with box sets or television on-demand services, bulk streaming series dropped in their entirety on Netflix, and being asked, âAre you still watching?â as though we havenât been lying prone for four hours, laptop on stomach, and wonât be for another four.  Richard Madden as David Budd and Keeley Hawes as Julia Montague in Bodyguard. Photograph: Des Willie/BBC/PA  But communal watching is making a return. Bodyguard, Jed Mercurioâs political thriller was released in the autumn of â get ready for this, because it seems absurd â 2018. Our critic gave it five stars, and the nation seemed to agree, holding its breath together in the opening scene of the first episode. It became the BBCâs most watched drama show since current record formats began, with an audience peak of 17 million for the finale.  At the beginning stages of the pandemic, James Grahamâs Quiz, based on his play â itself based on the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? 2001 cheating scandal, which involved a suspect win by couple Charles and Diana Ingram â lit up social media. ITVâs three-part drama was always likely to be a success, given the notoriety of the subject matter. But the genius of Quiz was that its popularity on social media, and the fact that we were all watching in tandem, brought in an interactive element. That was, of course, the foundation of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? which, quite literally, âasked the audienceâ. Theatregoers at Grahamâs play were also asked a question, both at the interval and at curtain down: guilty or not guilty?  It was a question that obsessed the nation during the Ingramsâ trial, and a question that obsessed us all again. Not only was everyone brought together nightly in a time of enforced isolation, but it was a nostalgic bond. What made it even better were the anecdotes that Graham tweeted about the making of the show, and that Charles Ingram himself got involved, replying to tweets and retweeting others. The Ingrams pleaded not-guilty at trial, were found guilty, but have always insisted they were innocent. They are currently appealing the sentence.  Somewhat surprisingly, the lucrative, much-wooed youth audience of 16- to 34-year-olds are getting on board with this old-fashioned idea of delayed televisual gratification. The first series of Phoebe Waller-Bridgeâs Fleabag, commissioned by BBC Three (which went online-only in 2016), was released all at once on iPlayer. But the second, and final, 2019 series proved to be well worth the wait for fans when it was released in weekly Monday-night instalments. Although each episode was released on iPlayer at 10pm, the BBC hoped that its young fans might be lured into watching it on BBC One half an hour later, bringing in a younger audience to its main broadcast channel, which has an average viewer age of 61.  More recently, the sublime I May Destroy You, by Michaela Coel, has also been released online on Mondays, this time in a duet of episodes each week. Killing Eve, another vehicle involving Waller-Bridge, returned to a weekly instalment for its third series â online and on traditional television â after previous series debuted on iPlayer all at once. (To British fansâ annoyance, episodes aired a day ahead in the US.)  Normal People, based on Sally Rooneyâs novel of the same name, has been another impeccable 2020 hit. The 12-part series (you guessed it, a BBC Three commission) was released in box set format on iPlayer; doubling BBC Threeâs opening-week record for online requests (previously held by Killing Eve) and also had a broadcast BBC One run with two episodes airing each Monday night. (This strategy of bringing BBC Threeâs youngsters over to BBC One has annoyed the News at Ten, which has taken a 10-minute programme cut.) It has even been mooted that BBC Three will make a comeback to traditional broadcast television.  Normal People was typical in its treatment online as a âwater-coolerâ success; screen-grabs, memes and hashtags. Every other tweet during April seemed to be about Connellâs chain (it even has an Instagram account). What is interesting about all these shows that are released both in all-at-once and weekly episodes is a sort of tacit online pact, that viewers, whether effusive or critical in their opinions, will not post obvious spoilers. Just as one would be given short shrift IRL, it is met with backlash.  Of course, modern reality television shows â Love Island, The Great British Bake Off â by their very format, have always lent themselves to social media communal watching. This behaviour is the direct descendant of people staying home in the evening to watch Big Brother on an actual television screen, wrapping the spiralling landline cord around their fingers while assessing eviction predictions, in real-time, with a friend.  With sport it has always been so â think of the well-known National Grid surge at half-time when everyone made their cups of tea. Now, on weekends when the top Premier League teams are playing, hashtags trend for those seeking to contribute armchair commentary. It is the same with Wimbledon (which often has its own Twitter custom emojis, known as âhashflagsâ). If you wake in the night like I do, it is a US sport I donât know the name of everyone is talking about.  Given that the way we consume dramatic programming was starting to shift back to this communal model even before the pandemic (see also: the massive online popularity of The Bros documentary), it looks as though this new habit will continue. Especially when we look at the popularity of the National Theatreâs Live series on YouTube, and the success of Disney+ showing Hamilton earlier this month.  In particular, it seems that giving viewers the choice of binge-watching or watching weekly is the way to go. But I would not be surprised if an increasing number of people are choosing the latter option, on the basis of looking forward to the online discussions and reactions. This change in viewing habits is even having an impact on how shows are written and directed.  The BBC recently won approval by Ofcom, after a competition assessment, for shows to remain on iPlayer for a year rather than 30 days. People will continue to have opportunities to watch shows in their own time and at their own pace, but increasingly we are all in this together.

What would happen to my mortgage?  If itâs a fixed-rate mortgage, a cut in interest rates would mean no change. Most households are on this type of deal â in recent years about nine in 10 new mortgages have been taken on a fixed rate.  Bank of England says UK economy recovering faster than first feared Read more  If it is a variable-rate mortgage â a tracker, or a mortgage on or linked to a lenderâs standard variable rate â the rate could fall a little if the base rate is cut. But the drop is likely to be limited by terms and conditions. Skipton building society, for example, has a tracker at 1.29 percentage points above the base rate that can only go up.  Older mortgages often have a minimum rate specified in the small print. Nationwide building society, for example, will never reduce the rate it tracks below 0% on mortgages arranged since 2009 â so if your mortgage is at base rate plus 1 percentage point, it will never fall below 1%. Santander specifies in some mortgages that the lowest rate it will ever charge is 0.0001%.  You will need to dig out your paperwork to see how low your mortgage rate could go.  Will new mortgages be free?  In Denmark, mortgages with negative interest rates went on sale last year. Borrowers with Jyske Bank were lent money at a rate of -0.5%, which meant the sum they owed fell each month by more than the sum they had repaid. There is no reason why UK lenders could not follow suit, although so far there is no sign that any will.  In the meantime, fixed-rate mortgages have been edging up in price but are still historically cheap. Big lenders including Natwest and HSBC both offer five-year fixed rates below 1.5%, if you have a large deposit, and you can fix over two years at less than 1.2%.  The cheapest tracker mortgages from earlier in the year have been pulled and repriced with larger margins, to cushion lenders against falling rates. If rates are cut again, expect more of that, as well as the collars already seen on some deals.  A negative base rate means banks and building societies have to pay to keep money on deposit, and it is designed to discourage them from doing so and make them keen to lend.  Fear over the property market and jobs mean lenders have started to look more closely at mortgage applications, and have made it harder to borrow with a low deposit. Nationwide, for example, has added a raft of terms and conditions on its 90% mortgage, including limiting how much of the deposit can be gifted by family or friends.  What happens to my savings?  Savings rates have already been hit by the two base rate cuts in March and some easy-access accounts from high street banks are already paying just 0.o1% in interest.  Some banks already charge for current accounts, but there is some way to go before you are forced to pay to keep small sums on deposit. At the moment, National Savings and Investments is still recruiting savers, and has an account paying monthly interest equivalent to 1.15% a year.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  Wealthy savers are likely to be the first who would face a charge. Last year, UBS started charging its ultra-rich clients a fee for cash savings of more than â¬500,000 (Â£449,000), starting at 0.6% a year and rising to 0.75% on larger deposits. And at the Danish Jyske Bank, similar charges apply.  What about loans and credit cards?  Personal loan rates are already low and are usually fixed, so you will not see your monthly repayments fall if rates go down. You can borrow Â£7,500 at a rate of 2.8% currently.  Credit card rates are usually low for new customers, but rise far above the base rate once introductory periods have ended, so will not be anywhere close to falling into negative territory.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/06/what-would-negative-interest-rate-mean-uk-consumers,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,193dd1fe9b247484d26c3ca8f14910ea983b3b77bade7279f5a21bff2ab435d7,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

But now dumped and ageing craft are breaking up, releasing toxins and microplastics across the world  Where do old boats go to die? The cynical answer is they are put on eBay for a few pennies in the hope they become some other ignorant dreamerâs problem.  As a marine biologist, I am increasingly aware that the casual disposal of boats made out of fibreglass is harming our coastal marine life. The problem of end-of-life boat management and disposal has gone global, and some island nations are even worried about their already overstretched landfill.  The strength and durability of fibreglass transformed the boating industry and made it possible to mass produce small leisure craft (larger vessels like cruise ships or fishing trawlers need a more solid material like aluminium or steel). However, boats that were built in the fibreglass boom of the 1960s and 1970s are now dying.  We need a drain hole for old boats. We can sink them, bury them, cut them to pieces, grind them or even fill them with compost and make a great welcoming sign, right in the middle of roundabouts in seaside towns.  But there are too many of them and weâre running out of space. To add to the problem, the hurricane season wreaks havoc through the marinas in some parts of the world, with 63,000 boats damaged or destroyed after Irma and Harvey in the Caribbean in 2017 alone.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Boats wrecked by Hurricane Irma are seen from a plane in Sint Maarten, Netherlands September 11, 2017. Photograph: Alvin Baez/Reuters  Most boats currently head to landfill. However, many are also disposed of at sea, usually by simply drilling a hole in the hull and leaving it to sink someplace offshore.  Some say that dumped fibreglass boats will make suitable artificial reefs. However, very little research has been done on at-sea disposal and the worry is that eventually these boats will degrade and move with the currents and harm the coral reefs, ultimately breaking up into microplastics. Recently, scientists have investigated the damage to mangrove, seagrass and coral habitats and although the effects have only been recorded on a relatively localised basis for now, the cumulative effect of abandoned boats may increase exponentially in the coming years.  To take one example, researchers from Plymouth University found high concentrations of copper, zinc and lead in sediment samples and inside the guts of ragworms in two estuaries in eastern England (Orwell and Blackwater). These contaminants greatly exceeded the environmental quality guidelines, and came from peeling paints from boats abandoned nearby.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Boats are often dumped once the cost of disposal exceeds the resale value. Photograph: WindVector/Alamy  Since no registration is needed for leisure vessels, the boats are often dumped once the cost of disposal exceeds the resale value, becoming the liability of the unlucky landowner. Human health hazards arise from chemicals or materials used in the boat: rubber, plastic, wood, metal, textiles and of course oil. Moreover, asbestos was employed extensively as an insulator on exhausts and leaded paints were commonly used as a corrosion inhibitor, alongside mercury-based compounds and tributyltin (TBT) as antifouling agents. Although we lack evidence on the human impact of TBT, lead and mercury are recognised as neurotoxins.  And then there are the repairs â grinding away at fibreglass boats, often in the open, creates clouds of airborne dust. Workers have not always worn masks and some succumbed to asbestosis-like diseases. Inevitably, some of the dust would find its way back into the water.  Plastic superhighway: the awful truth of our hidden ocean waste Read more  The fibreglass is filtered by marine shellfish (in my own research I found up to 7,000 small shards in oysters in Chichester Harbour in southern England) or cling on the shells of tiny water fleas and sink them to the seafloor. The particulate material accumulated in the stomach of shellfish can block their intestinal tracts and eventually lead to death through malnutrition and starvation.  The microparticles stuck on water fleas may have repercussions for swimming and locomotion in general, therefore limiting the ability of the organisms to detect prey, feed, reproduce, and evade predators. There is huge potential for these tiny specks of old boats to accumulate in bigger animals as they are transferred up the food chain.  Those microparticles are the resins holding the fibreglass together and contain phthalates, a massive group of chemicals associated with severe human health impacts from ADHD to breast cancer, obesity and male fertility issues.  Abandoned boats are now a common sight on many estuaries and beaches, leaking heavy metals, microglass and phthalates: we really must start paying attention to the hazard they pose to human health and the threats to local ecology.

2020-08-06 13:15:28.683746,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 05:00:22 GMT",The last of the Zoroastrians,"My grandfather had never been a tall man, and now he looked absurdly small, no bigger than a child. Swaddled in off-white sheets like a newborn, with just his head and the soles of his feet visible, his eyes were open and mouth disconcertingly agape, as if in surprise. His corpse was slightly raised from the floor, lain atop a rickety wooden stretcher. Beside the body, three priests in white robes intoned in Avestan, the long-dead language of the Zoroastrian scriptures, as a small fire burned in a silver urn in front of them.  It was the height of Mumbaiâs monsoon season, and the air in the prayer pavilion was heavy with moisture. The occasional cloudburst outside provided no respite from heat or humidity, and the priests cooled themselves with handheld fans that resembled ping-pong bats as they repeated their sonorous chants. The funeral was the first time I had heard Zoroastrian prayers spoken out loud, though I remembered my grandfather over the years murmuring them under his breath multiple times a day, velvet cap on his head and prayer book in his hand. Besides my mother and me, the small group in attendance was mainly made up of frail friends and distant relatives, almost all of them Parsis, as the Zoroastrians of India are known.  The cremation came later the same afternoon, the heat from the chrome furnace adding to the stickiness. The body was reduced in a matter of minutes to a kilogram of ashes, which were handed to us the next morning in a knotted sack the size of a coconut. Prayers continued the next day, the extended ceremony providing a map for slowly working through the grief.  In the days after the funeral, it struck me with some sadness that my grandfather, who had spent almost a century devoted to the Zoroastrian faith, would be the final Parsi in his family line. Growing up in Britain, Iâd read a bit about the history of Zoroastrianism, but only knew the basics: it was one of the oldest religions, based on the teachings of the prophet Zarathustra, who lived thousands of years ago, though nobody knew exactly where or when (Iran, central Asia, perhaps what is now southern Russia; and about 1500 BC, give or take a few centuries). The faith he preached, of an epic battle between a powerful deity and an evil spirit, in which his followers should do everything in thoughts, words and deeds to aid the side of light, was passed down orally for centuries before it was committed to parchment. It became the dominant religion of Persia for more than a millennium, until the advent of Islam in the seventh century. Some Zoroastrians who refused to convert fled, and ended up in Gujarat in western India, where they became known as Parsis after their Persian origins. They built new temples to house their sacred fires, which were tended to by priests and could never be extinguished.  The Parsis promised their Hindu hosts they would not proselytise, and over the centuries this morphed into a dogmatic aversion to conversion. The rigorous tribalism kept the small community alive and distinct for more than a millennium, but in todayâs world, the same intransigence is killing it off. âYouâve seen four weddings and a funeral â well, for Parsis, itâs four funerals and a wedding,â says Jehangir Patel, who has edited the communityâs monthly magazine, Parsiana, for almost 50 years. When he finally retires, he fears the magazine will simply close, as more of its readers are dying off each year. Indiaâs Parsi population shrank from 114,000 in 1941 to 57,000 at the last census in 2011. Projections suggest that by the end of the century, there will be just 9,000 left.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Pestonjee Pader, Shaun Walkerâs grandfather, in 2010. Photograph: Zareen Walker  My grandfather, Pestonjee Pader, was a gentle man with a raucous, childish sense of humour, but not far beneath the surface lurked a sense of tragedy. He liked to tell stories, but most of them ended in one of two ways: ââ¦ and then, unfortunately, we had to leaveâ, or ââ¦ and then, tragically, they passed away too soonâ. Born into a Parsi family in 1922, he grew up in the Gulf city of Aden, a thriving port then under British rule, which attracted many Parsi traders. After his father died in the late 30s, my grandfather took over the family business, supplying food and other provisions to the ships that docked in Aden on their way between Europe and Asia. He also ran the Long Bar, where he watered thirsty soldiers from the British garrison. He negotiated a concession from Carlsberg, importing beer from Denmark and eventually making a handsome profit. By the mid-60s, he was on the verge of setting up an ice-cream factory, a sure money-maker in the punishing Gulf heat. But the plans fell through when revolution came to southern Yemen in 1967, driving out the British and, by extension, the Parsis, too. My grandparents escaped to Bombay, leaving all but a few suitcases of possessions behind.  For my grandfather, the real tragedies were still to come: between 1976 and 1983, he lost his wife and both his sons, leaving my mother as his only surviving child. When we flew out to visit him during school holidays in the 90s, his once-grand apartment on Mumbaiâs Malabar Hill felt as if it were occupied by ghosts: a table laid with Carlsberg glasses and coasters, carefully preserved from decades earlier; photographs of the deceased on the sideboards. He padded around the too-big apartment, saying Zoroastrian prayers of remembrance for the dead several hours each day, and regularly taking the bus to the fire temple for prayers. In the evenings, he went out for dinner with his mostly Parsi friends, until they, too, started dying off. For as long as I can remember, he would say matter of factly that he was ready to die, but he kept on going, remaining healthy into his late 80s. It was only right at the end, when dementia hit, that he became weak and confused. In summer 2017, the news came that he had finally passed away, shortly after turning 95.  My grandfather stuck to his Zoroastrian faith doggedly, whatever obstacles life tossed into his path, but my mother was ejected from the Parsi fold, officially at least, when she married out. She came to London when she was 17, to go to university and then train as an English teacher. She slipped away from a planned marriage to a good Parsi boy, and later married my dad, another teacher from Southampton. Her parents, unlike many other relatives, quickly came to accept the marriage, but the strict community rules meant she was no longer a Parsi. Partly, she accepted this, and partly, she just ignored it. âNo religious bigot was going to define who I was,â she told me, and she continued to feel deeply attached to the cultural aspects of being Parsi.  Although my family often visited India when I was growing up, my sister and I never learned to speak Gujarati, and there was no suggestion among our Parsi relatives that we should partake in Zoroastrian rituals and ceremonies to feel a sense of belonging to the community, or even that we would be allowed to if we wanted. This wasnât something I fretted about. I liked the idea of a secret, Zoroastrian side of my identity, but in my studies and then my professional life, I gravitated towards Russia, not India or Zoroastrianism. On visits to Mumbai I felt like much more of an outsider than I did when walking the streets of Moscow, where I made my home as a foreign correspondent.  But the funeral stirred in me a new interest in the 3,500-year-old Zoroastrian religion and todayâs tiny Parsi community. As the religionâs followers declined, why were Parsis so dogmatic about keeping their doors closed to mixed-heritage children, let alone accepting outside converts? And did this mean that the whole Parsi community was heading for the same fate as my grandfather: a drawn-out but sadly inevitable disappearance?  Nearly three years later I found a way to seek some answers: a Return to Roots trip, which took a small group of young Parsis to India for an exploration of their history and culture. The idea was loosely modelled on Birthright Israel, which brings young Jews to the Holy Land, though our version was on a much smaller scale and free of attendant geopolitics.  I landed in Mumbai one night in early March, and the next morning the group met for orientation, each of us saying a few words about ourselves and what we hoped for from the next two weeks. Five of the 15 participants were from the dwindling Parsi community of Karachi; most of the others were children of Parsi parents who had moved to North America. They were divided between those who had strong connections to the religion and those who had lost touch and wanted to re-engage with it. There was one American-Iranian, whose family came from the small community of Zoroastrians who remained behind in Iran and live there to this day. And then there was me, the only halfie.  Arzan Sam Wadia, the Mumbai-born, New York-based architect who runs Return to Roots, had told me that the tour is emphatically not meant to function as a Parsi dating service, but he added immediately that new couples had indeed formed on previous tours, which was a pleasing side-effect. Certainly, on the first morning there was a tangible feeling of excitement at the presence of so many fellow members of that endangered species, the young Parsi. One of the volunteers accompanying us, Sheherazad, a 25-year-old Zoroastrian priest, told us he would be on hand to help with logistics and answer any spiritual questions, for those who had forgotten the prayers and rituals they learned as children (and for me, who never knew them in the first place). With a crop of bleached blond hair and a mischievous smile, he was far from the humourless, conservative figure I expected of a priest. He told us to call him Sherry.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest A Parsi fire temple in the Fort district of Mumbai, India. Photograph: Rainer Krack/Alamy Stock Photo  After the introductions, we headed to the Towers of Silence, a sprawling expanse of forested land in the heart of downtown Mumbai that takes its name from the stone structures inside the grounds, where the bodies of Zoroastrians are consigned after death. The whole area is closed to the public, and I felt a rush of excitement through my jetlag as our bus passed through the guarded gates, adorned with signs warning off non-Parsis. Herodotus, in the fifth century BC, wrote of Persians exposing their dead to vultures, and 2,500 years later the tradition persists: Parsi corpses are laid out inside the stone towers, also known as dakhmas (in fact, they are shaped more like amphitheatres than towers). The first dakhma was built here in 1670, when big cats roamed what was then a wild forest. Today, the grounds are populated with butterflies, parrots and peacocks, and entering the serene space from the urban cacophony outside is pleasingly jarring.  Our guide for the Mumbai leg of the tour was Khojeste Mistree, the intellectual kingpin of orthodox Parsis. Unfailingly polite yet ruthlessly dogmatic, Mistree trained as a chartered accountant before taking up Zoroastrian studies in Britain in the 60s, and later arrived back in India armed with historical knowledge to aid the conservative Parsis who wanted to keep the faith closed.  As we walked through the greenery towards one of the two dakhmas currently in use, Mistree exalted the Parsi method of consigning the dead. âIt is the best and most ecologically sound way to dispose of a corpse,â he said, explaining that it prevented the earth being polluted with the evil spirits present in a dead body. Mistree told us that each dakhma could hold more than 250 bodies, laid out on slats inside the round stone structures. When the bodies have fully decomposed, corpsebearers push the skeletons into a hole in the middle, though the high walls meant none of this was visible to us.  âYouâre standing here by this dakhma, and what can you smell?â asked Mistree in his distinctive voice, which drops just a hint of Bombay twang into the soaring cadences of an Oxford don. âThatâs right. Nothing. Whatever scurrilous gossip you read in the papers about rotting corpses and so on, itâs nonsense.â  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Vultures perched on one of the Towers of Silence in Mumbai, circa 1880. Photograph: Chris Hellier/Alamy Stock Photo  As recently as the 80s, hungry vultures had swooped into the dakhmas and picked Parsi corpses clean in a matter of days. Then, in the space of a decade, the birds died out, mainly owing to the use of diclofenac, a drug fed to livestock that poisoned vultures when they fed on the carcasses. Bodies inside the dakhmas were instead left to decompose naturally, which could take several months. On certain days, people living nearby could catch a putrid whiff of decaying human flesh from their windows. In 2006, someone sneaked a camera inside one of the dakhmas and leaked photographs of the gruesome sight online. Even the staunchest advocates of dakhma consignment were horrified, and began thinking up possible solutions. A programme to breed new vultures came to nothing. There was brief excitement at the creation of a specially designed mixture of herbs and chemicals, stuffed into the orifices of the dead, but it was so effective that the dakhma floors became covered in a layer of human slurry, on which the corpsebearers kept slipping, making their unenviable job still more difficult.  Eventually, angled solar reflection panels were installed at the top of the dakhmas to speed up the decomposition process, but a small group of Parsi reformists believed a more dignified option should be available. They raised money for a funeral hall, which was opened in the suburb of Worli in 2015, and that was where my grandfather chose to be cremated two years later. A little over 10% of the Mumbai Parsi community now opts for this method, mainly those who want to ensure that relatives who have married outside the faith will be able to attend their funerals. The priest who presided over my grandfatherâs funeral was one of two who agreed to work at the new prayer hall. The conservative majority was furious, and banned them from performing ceremonies at the Towers of Silence.  âIâm sorry to say,â said Mistree, in a tone that was notably unapologetic, âthat those Parsis who opt for cremation will go to hell.â Later, he clarified that Parsis who lived abroad could choose alternative methods, though never cremation, as it sullied fire with the evil spirits present in a dead body. But for those who lived in Mumbai, like my grandfather, there was no excuse. In Mistreeâs severe reading of Zoroastrianism, a man who had spent most of his 95 years on Earth steeped in prayer, and abiding by the exhortation to good thoughts, words and deeds, had been despatched to hell.  The next day, we boarded an open-top double-decker bus for a tour of the religious sites and cultural monuments of Parsi Mumbai, and a lesson about the Parsi influence on Indiaâs history. Mahatma Gandhiâs intellectual mentors? Parsis. Biggest philanthropists of 19th-century India? Parsis. The first underground cinema carpark in India? Built by a Parsi. âIt is quite mind-blowing how so few people have given so much,â said Mistree over a microphone, as our bus weaved through the jostle of the streets, above the honking cars and the chink-chink of the machines making juice from sugar cane. We lunched at the Ripon Club, a Parsi dining venue opened in 1884, amid grand portraits and busts of illustrious past members and tables seating a few geriatric current ones.  The following morning, in a lecture at Mistreeâs apartment, he laid out the basic tenets of Zoroastrianism. I was impressed with its answer to the agnosticâs most vexing question: why, if there is an almighty God, is there so much suffering on earth? The Zoroastrian God, Ahura Mazda, is locked in a permanent battle with Ahriman, an evil spirit. Ahura Mazda is omniscient but not omnipotent, meaning that famine, disease, killings and other evils are not the work of a jealous and vengeful God, but are instead the temporary triumph of Ahriman. Early Zoroastrianism had a great influence on other major religions, and some scholars believe that Jewish eschatology grew out of Zoroastrian thinking. The three wise men of the nativity story are thought to have been Zoroastrian priests.  Mistree moved on to the holy fires, which are central to Zoroastrian worship. Creating the âhighest gradeâ of fire requires the merging of 16 separate fires, he told us, including fire from a lightning strike and fire from the house of a king. The resultant super-fire takes 14,000 hours of prayer to consecrate, and can subsequently only be fed with sandalwood. âI was in England when Coventry cathedral was consecrated and the ceremony was only six to eight hours,â he said, pausing for us to savour the comparison. Mistree also spoke of the importance of the sudreh and kusti, an undershirt and belt tied ceremonially while praying, which had to be worn for any visit to a temple. Mistree insisted that to be a ârealâ Zoroastrian, a person had to wear their sudreh and kusti every day. Because I hadnât had a navjote â the Zoroastrian coming of age ceremony â I was not eligible to wear them, and thus not permitted to enter any fire temples. (Since a still-contested reform a century ago, children of mixed marriages in which the father is the Parsi can have a navjote and join the fold, but if the mother marries out, itâs game over.)  Facebook Twitter Pinterest A Parsi navjote ceremony in Mumbai in 2016. Photograph: Hemis/Alamy Stock Photo  Beneath the zealous adherence to ritual was a basic theology that seemed both simple and admirable. Zoroastrianism does not prize concepts such as guilt, martyrdom or asceticism. There is, instead, an obligation to work hard, make money, enjoy the proceeds and give generously. âFasting is a sin. Being unproductive is a sin,â said Mistree. âTo be spiritual you have to purposefully generate wealth, do it honestly and then share it.â  The exhortation to make money perhaps helps explain why many Parsis have been so successful in the world of business. My grandfather would speak about the work of lawyers and accountants with a note of wonder in his voice that some might reserve for spectacular works of art. âHe is good with moneyâ was perhaps his ultimate compliment. The most famous of the historical Parsi entrepreneurs was Jamsetji Tata, who was born into a poor family of Parsi priests in Gujarat in 1839, made his first money in the opium trade, and eventually became one of the 19th centuryâs most prominent industrialists and philanthropists. His holdings went on to become Tata Group, which today is one of the worldâs largest companies.  Our tour group was granted an audience with Jamsetjiâs 82-year-old great-grandson Ratan Tata, who spent more than two decades as chair of the group and still runs its charitable trusts. One afternoon, we drove to an office block in Mumbaiâs business district and filed into a meeting room inside. Tata entered soon after, stooped and hesitant, his wavy grey hair in a side parting. Sitting below a portrait of his ancestors, he spoke to us for an hour. He was delighted that we were taking an interest in our Zoroastrian roots, and described his vision of a typical Parsi as âhappy and joyful rather than revengeful and destructiveâ. Yet Tata seemed to have a pall of sadness over him, I thought, as he reflected on his own history as part of the community. When an earnest member of our group asked him to recount a time when his faith had positively influenced his life, he spoke instead of his escape from his overbearing Parsi family to the US, where he was able to study architecture and finally felt free and happy, before he was dragged back to India to be installed in the family business.  The evening before, we had paid a house call on Jimmy Mistry, a Parsi hotelier and bon vivant whose exuberance could hardly be more at odds with Tataâs melancholy, understated vibe. Mistry had built himself an ostentatious tower block in the suburb of Dadar, and had decorated its soaring exterior with oversized motifs of winged lions and bearded warriors, in homage to the grand ruins of Persepolis in Iran, the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid empire, whose dominant religion was Zoroastrianism. On the ground floor of Mistryâs block, there was a newly built fire temple, where our group stopped for a prayer. As this was a private temple, the fire had not been consecrated and so it was a rare case when, as a non-Parsi, I was allowed to enter. But as I went to fix a head-covering, copying the others in the group, Sherry, our young priest companion, accosted me. âItâs better if you wait outside,â he said firmly. I sat alone in a wicker chair, listening to the lilting intonations of the priest waft from the temple without being able to see a thing.

Photograph: Sam Panthaky/AFP/Getty Images  After the half-hour of prayer, we ascended in a lift and emerged into a dining room on the 19th floor, where a glass sculpture of a horse was suspended from the ceiling. A husky wearing a jewelled cravat padded across the chequered marble floor to greet us, and then came the host, wearing a tight black T-shirt and Louis Vuitton loafers. âWelcome to my humble abode,â Mistry said with a grin. We stepped on to a roof terrace just in time for the hazy sunset, and were then ushered up a floor to yet another terrace, where we chatted with Mistry and his family over canapes. It was a disgrace, he said, that there were so many rich Parsi businessmen who were not following the Zoroastrian command to spread their wealth. âEnough of silent charity, tell us what the fuck youâve done for the community! We need to start shaming people,â he said. I asked him how money could help reverse the decline in the Parsi population. What about taking a more inclusive line on who can be a Parsi? âPatrilineality is the only thing that has saved us over the centuries and allowed us to keep our identity,â he said, as the city darkened below.  Our programme in Mumbai came to an end, and we left early in the morning for the hill station of Lonavala. Mistry had organised a team-building exercise for us at a retreat he owned, where corporate executives receive military-style counter-terrorism training. After a bumpy hour in a jeep and then a short boat ride, we arrived at the luxury bootcamp, where the rooms had Kalashnikov lamp-stands and hand-grenade door handles, as well as Mistryisms engraved into various fixtures. ââA gun is like a woman: itâs all about how you hold herâ â Jimmy Mistryâ was etched into my bedside table. As the sun set, we were told to stand to attention as the national anthem played, and then the staff handed out fatigues to change into for the exercises, which I decided to skip, feeling a little queasy at the militarism. A billboard informed guests that the complex had been set up to help Indians take revenge for the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which Pakistani gunmen killed more than 150 people.

Photograph: Shaun Walker  This kind of patriotism has helped the Parsis to remain unscathed as Indiaâs turn towards Hindu extremism intensifies under prime minister Narendra Modi. âTheir love is without condition, without any expectation, and therefore the purest possible,â Modi said back in 2011, when he was still chief minister of Gujarat, suggesting that the Parsis were a model minority that others would do well to follow. Money has also helped: the Tata group has been the most lavish donor to Modiâs BJP party in recent years, with one of the Tata trusts giving 3.6bn rupees (Â£36.2m) in the 2018-19 financial year. The Parsis have long prided themselves on being able to get along with the rulers of the day, whoever they may be, and even the Parsi origin story reflects this knack for astute political messaging. When the refugees from Persia landed, so the tale goes, the Hindu king of Gujarat produced a full glass of milk, to signal that there was no space for new arrivals. The Persians stirred a spoonful of sugar into the milk without spilling any, to show they would sweeten the kingdom without disturbing it.  For the second half of our tour, we journeyed north to Gujarat. One of our first stops was Sanjan, the port where our ancestors arrived more than 1,000 years ago. A hot wind buffeted us as Sherry led a brief prayer on the sandy banks of the Varoli river, at the spot where the arriving Persians may or may not have produced that spoonful of sugar, and then we continued further north.  There was an energy and excitement inside our tour bus during the long journeys of the next few days, despite the unavoidable theme of ageing and decay that marked much of the trip. We played raucous games of Mafia and danced in the aisle to songs blasted through a bluetooth speaker. Sherry was a ringleader in both the card games and the dancing, rallying the troops and wiggling his hips to the music. A popular choice was Bohemian Rhapsody, sung by the most famous Parsi of them all, Farrokh Bulsara. Born to Parsi parents from Gujarat who resettled in Zanzibar for business, Bulsara went to school near Mumbai, moved to Britain in 1964 and soon took the name Freddie Mercury. He was quietly ignored by much of the community owing to his life choices and sexuality â I remember once perusing a book of 100 Famous Parsis at a relativeâs house and finding multiple bridge construction engineers, but no Freddie Mercury â but the young diaspora Parsis on the bus had no qualms in claiming him as one of their own.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Parsi priests outside a fire temple in Gujarat, India. Photograph: IndiaPictures/Universal Images Group/Getty Images  I started to ponder the idea of having a late-in-life navjote, egged on by many of the friendly co-participants in the tour, who thought it would be a fun excuse to all meet up again. I floated the idea with Sherry, but as we got chatting on the bus, I quickly realised I had been mistaken to infer from his bleached hair and carefree demeanour that he was a reformer and would approve of the idea. In Zoroastrianism, there is no need to be ascetic or severe in order to be conservative. Sherry told me that if either parent was not a Parsi, the child was not one either, and he would not perform a navjote. He did not even accept the century-old ruling allowing navjotes for those children who have just a Parsi father. It seemed odd, given that Sherry was clearly devoted to the communityâs survival, and spoke with visible passion about his work as a priest. Wasnât this kind of attitude hastening its decline? âWe want to focus on quality, not just quantity,â he said.  I pointed out to him that there were many people on our tour who might end up marrying non-Parsis. Was it really necessary to kick them and their offspring out of the religion? âThey know what theyâre getting into,â he said, in a tone that brooked no further discussion. Sherry combined a fervent commitment to religious dogma and ritual with a remarkably warm, laid-back attitude to just about every other aspect of life. It was a curious combination, but one I came to recognise in many Parsis we met.  We arrived late one evening in Udvada, the small Gujarat town that houses the holiest fire in all Zoroastrianism, the Iranshah. Laying eyes on the Iranshah was set to be the highlight of the tour for most of the group. If legend is to be believed, the fire was consecrated shortly after the arrival of the Parsis in India, and has been burning constantly for more than a millennium. The current temple that houses it dates from the 1740s, and before priests are allowed to conduct prayer ceremonies there, they must undergo a nine-day purification ritual, during which they can have no human contact. The narrow lanes that make up the centre of old Udvada are lined with once-spectacular Parsi mansions now mostly fallen into disrepair. Just a handful of Parsi families still live in the town, though there are a number of inns for the pilgrims who come regularly from Mumbai and across the world. We checked into one of them, which had simple rooms that were bare save for a bed, a ceiling fan and a small representation of Zarathustra on the wall.  The next day, while everyone else went to take the requisite pre-prayer shower, I paid a visit to Khurshed Dastoor, the Iranshahâs high priest. He lived across from the temple, in a villa with windows open to the street, through which he was visible sitting at a desk, dressed in white. Dastoor beckoned me into his home with a flick of the wrist. He had a week of beard, and meaty earlobes that reminded me of my grandfatherâs. Now 57, he had undergone priestly training at the same time as studying business and economics in Mumbai. On the wall were portraits of his father, grandfather and great-grandfather, and he could trace his lineage back 21 generations, all of them high priests of the Iranshah fire. He took up the role in 2002, when his father died. âSometimes I thought I didnât want to do it, but then I realised I had no choice. I think if you are born into this kind of family, youâre stamped that you will become a priest,â he said, brushing away persistent mosquitoes as he spoke.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Iranshah fire temple in Udvada, Gujarat. Photograph: Dinodia Photos/Alamy  Dastoor told me that nowhere in the Zoroastrian texts does it say children from mixed families should not be allowed to be Zoroastrians. When I asked him about Mistreeâs assertion that people like my grandfather who chose to be cremated would go to hell, he became irate. âThis is where weâve gone wrong as a religion,â he said. He told me that while he would personally prefer to be consigned to a dakhma, adherence to ritual and dogma was a secondary concern: âThe improvement of your soul, ideas, the kindness you show to people, to help educate and show charity to your family, your whole community and all of society â this is how we should measure a good Zoroastrian.â  I was pleasantly surprised to find that one of the religionâs highest priests was a reformer. I asked him whether, if I did decide to have a navjote from a liberal priest, I would be allowed into his temple to see the Iranshah fire. He shook his head, with perhaps a hint of regret. He was bound by the regulations of the townâs nine-priest council, and while he was open to discussing all kinds of reform, the votes were always eight to one against him. Even his mild utterances in favour of change had got him âin a soupâ with traditionalists, he said.  Still, he was adamant that the community would need to make serious changes if it was going to survive. But what, exactly? He sighed. âIf I said conversion, I would be torn down. Itâs not the right time and not the right place. But we have to think of something. Though, to be honest, I doubt we can make a difference. I donât see any optimistic future.â  There was something inspiring about the people we had met who were upholding a tradition that went back more than three millennia. I felt proud of my connection to this heritage, and a little deflated that I could never become a ârealâ Parsi. Still, it was hardly devastating for someone who had not previously felt a strong connection to the community. I was more interested how some of the others on the trip felt, especially the women. They had grown up practising the religion, had been interested enough to come on this trip, and were being told they would be kicked out if they married out. Many said they would prefer to marry a Parsi, but most accepted this was unlikely, given how few they met in their normal lives. Our tour had not, as far as my sleuthing could detect, resulted in the formation of any new Zoroastrian couples.  âItâs very sad, but itâs only in India,â said Tanya, a 28-year-old film-maker, born in Karachi and raised in Toronto, on being told she was no longer a Parsi if she married out. While she was proud of both her Zoroastrian faith and her Parsi heritage, she thought it absurd to insist that the Parsis should be the religionâs only gatekeepers. In the diaspora communities of North America, fire temples are open to everyone, and there is no controversy over navjotes for children of mixed parentage, she told me. The small community of Iranian Zoroastrians is even more liberal, allowing female priests, and there are also nascent neo-Zoroastrian movements in parts of the Middle East. âZoroastrianism will always be there, it doesnât need a race to exist,â she said. âIâd rather the religion flourishes and moves on and affects people positively than itâs a secret club you are born into.â  As the tour approached its end, we visited Navsari, the city from which the Tata family originated, and where both of my Parsi great-grandmothers were born and raised. We stopped at a library that housed ancient Persian and Gujarati Zoroastrian texts, the grand reading room adorned with portraits of illustrious Parsis of yore. We also stopped at the Vadi Daremeher, a seminary that has trained Parsi priests for nearly nine centuries, but no longer has any students.  On my last day before leaving India, I met with the Parsi leader Dinshaw Tamboly, who has long been an outspoken reformist voice, and was the driving force behind the creation of the prayer hall and crematorium where my grandfatherâs funeral had taken place. He wanted to be cremated when he died, he told me, and was adamant that new voices would win out over traditionalists in the end. As we spoke, his phone flickered into life with an urgent message. An elderly priest in Mumbai had accidentally set himself on fire while praying in his fire temple, and died.  About time: why western philosophy can only teach us so much Read more  The news made me think about two elderly priests I had met a couple of days earlier, when we hopped off the bus at Nargol, a coastal town where the formerly sizeable Parsi population has dwindled to just a few families. Darabshaw Govadia was 86 and could barely walk; he was helped by his brother Rusi, a former bus driver who, at 80, was marginally sprightlier. Both priests were living inside the local temple, a handsome yellow structure with a sloping roof and fringed with lush greenery. They tended the fire throughout the day and night, always wearing their billowing white robes and receiving their meals from the town in tiffin boxes. They told me they had just a few visitors each day.  I asked who would replace them when they were no longer physically able to perform their duties. âWe donât know,â said Darabshaw in a croaky whisper. We concluded our stilted chat as the rest of the group emerged from saying their prayers, and we all assembled around the brothers on the steps of the temple for a group photograph. Then, it was time for us to leave. The two brothers smiled faintly in farewell, and shuffled back into the temple, to resume the prayers at their sacred flame.  â¢ Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/06/last-of-the-zoroastrians-parsis-mumbai-india-ancient-religion,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,3af92c5558efbf2b4240f1d70a5684723782c7dcde638f540fae2e6d533bfd09,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Then you're stuck in the politics of the past,"The Trump administration has floated the idea of sanctioning Chinese officials and members of the Communist party of China. Before we ask whether this is a good idea, letâs ask how Sino-US relations got to this stage.  The US cold war with the Soviet Union was over ideology, but todayâs standoff with China is different. The Chinese state has no ideology, no religion, no moral agenda. It continues wearing socialist garb but only as a face-saving pretence. It has, in fact, become a state-capitalist dictatorship. What the world sees today is a contest between the US system of free-market capitalism and Chinese state capitalism. How should we read this chessboard?  The post-Mao dictatorship in China has lived by the principle of ârepress at home and be open to the worldâ. It has imported knowhow from abroad. There are an estimated 360,000 Chinese students currently enrolled who have come through Americaâs open door. Over 40 years, at least a million have returned to China and fed their new technical knowledge into the existing authoritarian structures that have built the dictatorship. It might be the most momentous personnel transfer in history.  When I applied to study in the US in the 1980s, I filled out a questionnaire that asked if I had ever been a member of the Communist party. The point of the question was presumably to avoid ideological risks. But it is beyond doubt that the Chinese students coming in with me included many party members who were headed to some of the USâs finest schools, often with scholarships. Americans generally assumed that these students would feel the appeal of liberal values, which they would then take back to China. What happened more often, though, was that Chinese students were quick to see the cultural differences between the two countries, and to draw the very logical conclusion that American values are fine for America but would never work in the Chinese system.  If those US hopes for the exportation of values had panned out, much of China would have been won over by now. But what has actually happened? Returnees are now leaders in much of Chinese business and industry, but anti-American expression in China is as strong today as it has been since the Mao era.  Washington bears much of the responsibility for what has happened. In the years after the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, administrations of both parties touted the absurd theory that the best plan was to let China get rich and then watch as freedom and democracy evolved as byproducts of capitalist development.  But did capitalist competition, that ravenous machine that can chew up anything, change China? The regimeâs politics did not change a whit. What did change was the US, whose business leaders now approached the Chinese dictatorship with obsequious smiles. Here, after all, was an exciting new business partner: master of a realm in which there were virtually no labour rights or health and safety regulations, no frustrating delays because of squabbles between political parties, no criticism from free media, and no danger of judgment by independent courts. For European and US companies doing manufacture for export, it was a dream come true.  Money rained down on parts of China, it is true. But the price was to mortgage the countryâs future. Society fell into a moral swamp, devoid of humanity and difficult to escape. Meanwhile, the west made their adjustments. They stopped talking about liberal values and gave a pass to the dictatorship, in which Deng Xiaopingâs advice of âdonât confrontâ and Jiang Zeminâs of âlie low and make big bucksâ made fast economic growth possible.  European and American business thrived in the early stages of the China boom. They sat in a sedan chair carried up the mountain by their Chinese partners. And a fine journey it was â crisp air, bright sun â as they reached the mountainâs midpoint. But then the chair-carriers laid down their poles and began demanding a shift. They, too, sought the top position. The signal from the political centre in China changed from âdonât pick fightsâ to âgo for itâ. Now what could the western capitalists do? Walk back down the mountain? They hardly knew the way.  Covid-19 has jolted the US into semi-awareness of the crisis it faces. The disease has become a political issue for its two major political parties to tussle over, but the real crisis is that the western system itself has been challenged. The US model appears to others as a bureaucratic jumble of competing interests that lacks long-term vision and historical aspiration, that omits ideals, that runs on short-term pragmatism, and that in the end is hostage to corporate capital.  Are sanctions the way to go? A foreign ministry spokesperson in Beijing recently remarked words to the effect that the US and China are so economically interlocked that they would amount to self-sanctions. The US, moreover, would be no match for China in its ability to endure suffering. And there he was correct: in dictatorships, sacrifices are not borne by the rulers. In the 1960s Mao said: âCut us off? Go ahead â eight years, 10 years, China has everything.â A few years later Mao had nuclear weapons and was not afraid of anyone.  The west needs to reconsider its systems, its political and cultural prospects, and rediscover its humanitarianism. These challenges are not only political, they are intellectual. It is time to abandon the old thinking and the vocabulary that controls it. Without new vocabulary, new thinking cannot be born. In the current struggle in Hong Kong, for example, the theory is simple and the faith is pure. The new political generation in Hong Kong deserves careful respect from the west, and new vocabulary to talk about it.  âSanctionsâ is a cold war term that names an old policy. If the US canât think beyond them, the primacy of its position in this changing world will disappear.",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/06/sanctions-china-politics-us-showdown,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,3408582d889065139935f59a187ae148427a3af50ad30a20646476ff2cc90f49,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Itâs a year from now and Covid-19 hasnât gone away. The economy is in the doldrums, with unemployment rising and inflation well below its 2% target. The Bank of England has been pumping money into the financial system through its quantitative easing (QE) programme but to little effect. Whatâs its next move?  One option for Threadneedle Street would be to say it was effectively out of options and pass responsibility for further stimulus over to the chancellor. After more than a decade of ultra-low interest rates and hundreds of billions worth of QE, there is a strong case for fiscal policy â tax cuts and public spending increases â doing the heavy lifting.  There would, though, be one last thing the Bank could try and that option â negative interest rates â is now under active consideration. In the event that the economy does materially worse than the Bankâs monetary policy committee is predicting, the official interest rate would be cut below zero.  In the past, notably during the financial crisis of 2008-09, Threadneedle Street has publicly rejected the use of negative rates, warning that they would make banks less profitable and potentially drive some of them to the wall.  But as the Bankâs governor, Andrew Bailey, noted on Thursday, life has moved on. Banks are less vulnerable than they were a decade or so ago, other central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, have used them, and estimates of how low interest rates can go have moved down. âTen years is a long time in monetary policy,â Bailey said in a nod to Harold Wilson.  The seriousness with which negative rates are being considered can be judged by the fact that the Bank devoted four pages of its latest monetary policy report (MPR) to weighing up the pros and cons. You donât do that if you are trying to kick the idea into the long grass.  Baileyâs response to a question about negative rates at his MPR press conference was also revealing. âThis is the most extensive assessment we have ever done,â the governor said. âIt is sensible to have negative interest rates in the tool box but we are not planning to use them at the moment.â  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  The key words there are âat the momentâ. Although the economy has performed a bit more strongly than the Bank envisaged in the scenario it sketched out three months ago, it thinks the pace of recovery will slow and be more protracted. Whatâs more, it views the risks as being very much to the downside.  What does that mean? It means that there is no prospect of monetary policy being tightened for a very long time, as the MPR made clear. It means that there will probably be more QE as activity slows over the winter. And it means that the debate about the use of negative rates will not go away. The use of them remains a case of if not when, but markets should take note of Baileyâs warning that there are some âhard yardsâ ahead.

Still, I feel a benevolent sort of jealousy. âLucky sods,â I think, whether they are in Cornwall or the Costa del Sol. Like many others, I have been walking the same streets since March, but Iâve been dreaming of the Greek sea. I miss its particular clarity; shades of glittering aquamarine. Salt on my lips washed off with delicious cheap, thin white wine. Last year, I was there, reading Emily Wilsonâs translation of the Odyssey as I watched fishermen shell prawns on the harbour front. It feels like a hallucination, now.  Holidays are a luxury. As with gardens, the pandemic has demarcated the haves and the have-nots. Some people have lost their livelihoods, others are able to carry on holidaying as usual. There will be some anger at those who travelled abroad, but I also wonder how many of these censorious types have second homes, or can afford preposterously expensive UK holiday lets.  After encouraging people to go abroad without there being any comprehensive airport testing in place, the government now wants us to take a âstaycationâ, a term which used to mean staying in your house while not working, but which has now been rebranded as taking your holidays in the UK. Yet again, citizens are blamed for the decisions they have made, when the governmentâs message has been muddled and inconsistent and without thought to the reasons why Brits, at a time when many people are struggling financially, are opting for cheaper foreign getaways.  There are powerful arguments against going abroad at the moment. But who am I to condemn say, a care worker, who wants two weeks in Benidorm after a fraught and hellish few months? Does the person who delivered your groceries really deserve to be shamed for his Jet2 jaunt to Paphos? At the same time, in Snowdonia, where I grew up, lots of lovely middle-class people have flocked there and are busy littering and freaking out local people, many of whom are still trying to shield from the virus.  It wouldnât be Britain if there werenât a class double standard, but it still makes me sad. Weâve all been through a lot, and most of us have made sacrifices for the safety of others in our communities. Now we are all being instructed to make our own decisions, and others are casting judgment. Of course there are those who are behaving as though it is all over, but most of us are doing our best to weigh up the risks of everything we do.  Growing up, we didnât go on holiday much, though one gorgeous trip visiting family in Donegal is imprinted on my memory â white sand and silverfish, scorching sun, my first kiss outside an old workhouse. It was too expensive to go abroad, and my brother is severely disabled. He has never left the country. Sometimes I dream of making it rich and taking him to a villa (we would need two carers), just so he can see how warm and clear the sea can be abroad. Like me, he loves swimming. As a child, I would get brochures from travel agents and spend hours perusing the all-inclusive hotels with their giant pools and their waterslides, their all-you-can-drink pineapple juice and karaoke bars. I wanted to go more than anything.  Covid-19 is shrinking horizons for our holidays â perhaps for our lives too | Gaby Hinsliff Read more  We were lucky to grow up where we did, around lakes and forests and beaches, where at least we could get some of that holiday feeling at home. Many people live concrete-paved lives. They long for beautiful scenery, but mostly itâs the time. Thatâs what holidays are about, really: time. The hours we work means that we can spend months living alongside other people and feel that we have not really seen them at all. Put us on a cheap flight to Crete and after a few days we relax into ourselves. The stress dissipates. We look across a taverna table at their pink faces as they nurse a cold Mythos and shove courgette fritters into their gobs and we feel, well, love.  In the past few months, I have come to realise just how much I relied on holidays to keep me sane. Yes, we are in the middle of a pandemic, and yes thereâs the climate emergency to consider, but the draw is strong. I wouldnât go into a pub in central London right now, but Greece is beckoning me (âcome,â my Greek friend said, âwe need your British poundsâ). Itâs a case of cognitive dissonance, in the absence of effective government policy.  Will I go? It depends on the risk at the time to me and the risk Iâd pose to the country I would be visiting. Should they close the borders, I would not complain. Not if it saved lives. An ITU doctor I interviewed, exhausted from watching patients die, cried when she saw the photographs of packed beaches.  I understand her perspective, just as I understand the people (some of them doctors) who are desperate to get away, who feel strung out and sad and they just want to have a fag on a sun lounger while they watch their kids play in the spume, their crappy airport novel abandoned, its pages greasy from lotion. We all want a break from Covid-19, delusional as that may be. We all want some respite from the fear of this horrible disease. We all want to forget that it might be here to stay. It seems we just havenât accepted it yet.  â¢ Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett is a Guardian columnist",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/06/holiday-coronavirus-fantasy-greece-government-policy,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,c97c958b3ca1bfaa34e69df09aacd2ce3fc2a15ab7f961b87f74b5ead02c2039,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:15:30.081681,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 11:17:45 GMT",Modi's acolytes have reminded India's Muslims just what he thinks of them,"Mussolini confided in his son that one of his nightmares was that he would be put on trial at New Yorkâs Madison Square Garden, in case of capture by the Allies. Narendra Modiâs fantasy was to hold his victory rally there, as he did in September 2014, soon after being elected prime minister of India. Returning triumphantly to the heart of the very empire that denied him a diplomatic visa and revoked his tourist visa for an anti-Muslim pogrom carried out while he was chief minister in Gujarat in 2002, Modiâs presence at Madison Square Garden sparked off the rapturous belligerence of 20,000 supporters. Since then, through events like âHowdy Modiâ and âNamaste Trumpâ, Modi appears to have made America his second home and Donald Trump a buddy, a coming together of civilisations ancient and modern as well as a merger of two failed states with among the highest rates of Covid-19 infection in the world.  The coronavirus might have been expected to put a halt to Modiâs American fantasies, it being as difficult to leave the United States now as it is to enter India. Nevertheless, this didnât stop Modiâs Hindu right supporters in the United States â fronted by a group called the American Indian Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) â who decided to lease giant screens in Times Square on Wednesday 5 August to display images of the Hindu god Ram and a temple to Ram being inaugurated that day in India by Modi.  There was a demo and a counter-demo and, while the plan to project an image of the proposed temple on the high-profile Nasdaq screen in Times Square did not materialise, one digital board showing the temple aired over the Hersheyâs store for a limited part of the day. As their celebration of the temple appeared on a giant screen, the âIndian communityâ distributed sweets in Times Square. Protests were lodged with the mayor and with the billboard companies by a diverse range of groups, and were apparently successful in preventing the images from being displayed on a majority of the screens, including those on the Nasdaq building, but even the solitary airbrushed image of the Ram temple concealed far more than it revealed.  The temple construction is taking place in the provincial north Indian city of Ayodhya. This demolition was the high point of a long campaign by the Hindu right, so successful in creating an imagined grievance that it turned the BJP from a political oddity to the totalitarian behemoth it is today.  Modi knows how to unleash beasts as well as how to render them acceptable on a global stage, airbrushed and Disneyfied, while his engine of cruelty rolls on  Even before the mosque was demolished, Hindus in India and abroad were asked to donate bricks to build a Ram temple, based on the claim that the mosque stood on the alleged birthplace of Ram. Bricks, some made of gold, arrived from Britain and the United States as well as from thousands of villages and towns in India in response to this campaign. Yet rather than birth, violent death was the true shrine of this campaign. Around 2,000 people died in the spiral of violence set off by the demolition of the mosque; soon the vilification of Muslims had become an everyday affair in India. Even the Gujarat pogroms in 2002 were set off by an incident involving the death of Hindu pilgrims returning to Gujarat from Ayodhya after a celebration of the demolition of the mosque.  Not surprisingly, such belligerence produced nothing in the way of the sacred. In a scene in Ram Ke Naam (1992), Anand Patwardhanâs remarkable documentary of the Ayodhya campaign â and a film routinely prevented from being screened in India by Hindu-right organisations â one can observe the barrage of threats directed against Muslims by men marching toward the still existing mosque, even as an elderly Hindu pilgrim who has been visiting a nearby sacred site for years shakes his head in dismay and wants nothing to do with the campaign instigated by the BJP. In the decades since then, Ayodhya has spiralled further downhill.  The poet Vivek Narayanan, who has been working on a book of poems inspired by the Ramayana, the epic detailing Ramâs exploits, emailed me last December after a visit to Ayodhya. He described something that was âalmost a ghost town,â with crumbling houses, a population almost crazed by anger and deprivation, and soldiers guarding the temple construction site in a manner that made it feel âlike a maximum security prisonâ.  If this is what is being celebrated as Hindu culture in Times Square, it is because Modi and his acolytes know well how one hand washes the other. We see today an agile fascism of the 21st century. It understands well that in Ayodhya, in an India reeling from a failed lockdown and a thousand other miseries, the apparent victory in Times Square will have as much weight as the victory of the temple being constructed in India. Since 5 August also happened to be the one-year anniversary of the BJPâs unilateral suspension of the special status of Kashmir, a move that led to Kashmiris being subjected to suspension of all civil liberties, this brazen celebration will also serve to remind Muslims in India of their subjugated status in every way, a reminder that nothing is available to them in Modiâs India, neither history nor geography.  Mussolini was an old-school fascist who feared being stared at by an accusing crowd in New York, of appearing to them as something like a âcaged wild beastâ. Modi, far more clever, knows how to unleash beasts as well as how to render them acceptable on a global stage, airbrushed and Disneyfied, while his engine of cruelty rolls on, expanding his maximum security prisons from Kashmir and Ayodhya to India at large. In order for this not to continue with impunity, the beast will have to be caged. Hatred should never have been allowed to express itself in one of the most diverse cities in the world.  â¢ Siddhartha Deb is an Indian author and journalist.

If you have shares in Rishi Sunak, sell them now | Aditya Chakrabortty","For a hint of what the near future of this country holds, talk to Emily Pringle. At the end of June, she advertised a job with her home-fragrance firm, Notes of Northumberland. Based in pretty Alnwick, with lovely colleagues â 16 hours a week, working mainly in the shop. Pringle might ordinarily expect 40-odd CVs. This time, she was deluged: within a fortnight, almost 600 people applied.    Many lived more than 30 miles away, in Newcastle. Most were vastly overqualified, and a good number had PhDs. All were now fighting for part-time work in retail. âIt made me sad,â Pringle tells me. âThatâs not why they spent so long studying. But it says a lot about the state of the jobs market.â    Look around and these stories are unfolding all over Covid UK. A Manchester restaurant wants a receptionist: over the next 24 hours, almost 1,000 people write in. A south London pub seeks two bar staff: 500 candidates step forward.  Shocking numbers, for now. But by Christmas such vignettes will be piled higher than the snow because, if the official projections are correct, the UK faces a jobs crisis the likes of which it hasnât confronted for two generations. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts that this winter unemployment will rocket to levels last seen in the early 1980s under Margaret Thatcher, with nearly one in eight workers unemployed. Thought youâd been hurt badly by the banking crash of 2008? Just wait.  Here is the ultimate implication of the OBRâs analysis: if you are under 50, chances are you will never have been in a labour market as tough as the one that lies just ahead. The face of the 1980s recession was The Full Monty: male, middle-aged and on the scrapheap, alongside his heavy industrial employer. The face of the 2020 depression is more likely to be young, female and just let go from a restaurant â but in the early surge it will include a lot of people, from every walk of life.  Once the summer lull is over, an earthquake will shake Britain. Its early tremors can be felt already, as unemployment rises, yet few in the political classes have paused to consider the havoc it will wreak, let alone what might seriously be done about it. If anything, the government is helping to bring on the jobless crisis. This week, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has begun cutting the subsidy he gives employers to keep workers on the payroll. That scheme has helped protect 9.5 million jobs and its gradual withdrawal will immediately mean more P45s being handed out. Not that youâll hear much about it: Sunak prefers doing photo-ops to publicise his scheme to give voters half-price Happy Meals.  The government that had to be shamed into finding Â£120m to feed hungry kids over the school holidays happily chucks four times that â half a billion pounds â on a 13-day gimmick. Priorities, eh? Yet Sunakâs reward is ever more newspaper profiles. Last Saturday the Times magazine embellished its portrait of the chancellor with a Photoshopped halo.  Extending the furlough scheme would cost little â and benefit the whole of the UK | Garry Young Read more  Any pundits with stocks in the chancellor should cash them in now, because from this sunlit peak his standing can only fall. After doing many of the right things in March to save jobs, Sunak has done precious little since. The result will be to waste much of the Â£200bn he has spent to keep businesses and workers afloat.  The Treasury fully shuts its job retention scheme entirely at the end of October. Firms will be offered a small bonus to hold on to staff, but many will make redundancies. At that point, temporarily-idled employees who have been drawing 80% of their wages will crash through a trapdoor into the harsh world of unemployment benefits.  David Cameronâs government spent much of the past decade deliberately shredding the social safety net. âThis is not an easy life any more, chum,â boasted welfare secretary Iain Duncan Smith in 2012. He and his chums helped ensure the UK went into the current crisis with one of the meanest employment safety nets in the industrialised world. And while Sunak has raised some benefits, they remain abysmally low.  What awaits those unlucky millions who go from being âstriversâ, as George Osborne called them, to âskiversâ? A massive shock. Early surveys by the Resolution Foundation show that of those starting to claim universal credit since the lockdown, one in three are already falling behind on bills. Later this month, landlords will be allowed to evict tenants who canât pay their rent, and mortgage lenders will again be able to repossess homes.  Imagine what this adds up to: a graduate a couple of years out of university loses her job, then her rented flat then, if lucky, ends up back at her parentsâ with a mountain of debt. To keep up on the mortgage, a family goes from shopping at Sainsburyâs to queueing at the food bank. And the part-time lecturer with a PhD has no option but to try for that job selling scented candles.    Across the country, people who believed theyâd done the right things and thought they were secure will find they donât get the right outcome. People who trusted a government, a state, to look after them will learn differently. Those parts of the country that last December went blue may not flip back to Labour â they may instead switch to Nigel Farage, who has been busking hard over this pandemic. And as economist Paul Gregg observes, when the dust clears, those who will ultimately be hit the hardest will be the young, those from deprived areas, and especially minority ethnic people.  In her just-completed book, Abusing Power, journalist Kate Belgrave documents the toll the welfare state takes on those who need it most. She records how Paul, battling in his filthy caravan to keep himself presentable, is told by a housing officer, âYouâre too well-dressed to be homelessâ, while jobcentre staff interrogate Marsha, who has mental health problems, about her childhood abuse. The government suspended much of this bullying early in the pandemic, but soon enough it will restart.  The welfare system has been reconfigured to punish Other People, not to help People Like Us. It is not fit for an era of mass unemployment. But neither is much else about polarised, privatised Britain during this pandemic. An economy addicted to consumerism looks useless at this point â when the last thing anyone wants is cafes, hotels and consumer services. The low-paid precarious jobs fostered by Tory ministers over the past decade will be among the first to go in this depression.  Over the crises of the past 40 years, the political class has always offered a better tomorrow. Thatcher responded to industrial decline with a services revolution and a credit boom. Tony Blair promised a knowledge economy. Cameron urged us on in the global race. For all his bombast and bluster, Boris Johnson canât point to any sunlit upland just ahead.

I write this in the tiny walled Croatian city of Dubrovnik. Getting here was a dispiriting business. Heathrow felt unsettlingly odd: eerily empty, yet too busy. Walking in there, I donned a mask and didnât remove it until I left the terminal building at Dubrovnik, only to be asked by the taxi driver to put it back on when I got into his cab.  The entrance to the restaurant in the hotel resembles scenes from MASH, when the doctors scramble to be ready for incoming wounded. Masks and latex gloves are hurriedly donned so we can be cleared to commence the dissection of the breakfast buffet.  The weather has been unusually poor, but the old town is enchanting in any light. And a guide called Roberto De Lorenzo has made me see tourism in a different light. He is from a long line of residents of the old town. I said how nice it must be for him to have a bit more space this year, without the cruise ships disgorging their human cargo every five minutes. But he had no truck with this line of thought.  âWhen the cruise ships come, and thousands and thousands of people are packed in here, in the summer heat, it feels to me like the most authentic experience you could have of Dubrovnik, as it was in the height of its trading powers. You think then it was quiet and peaceful? No, it was totally crowded and mad, just like it normally is here at this time of year. Who are we to complain? It was the lively interaction of crowds from around the world that made us great in the first place. If weâd stayed closed to the world, weâd still be a fishing village.â  I hadnât thought of it like that. Roberto is like a living embodiment of the great trading era.

I loved it there',"âThere were hard times,â JÃ©rÃ´me Boateng says as his mind drifts back to Bayern Munichâs wobbles at the start of the season. âItâs like being a child. As a child if I had no confidence, if you donât get trust from your friends, then you lose the joy of the game. Thatâs what happens now, even when Iâm older.â  Boateng, one of the finest defenders of his generation, could feel the spark ebbing away. Bayern were on the slide under Niko Kovac, a coach struggling to connect with a champion squad, and time finally appeared to have caught up with the old guard. Thomas MÃ¼ller and Manuel Neuer were under pressure and Boateng, aware that people were starting to view him as a fading force, wondered whether a change of scenery was required.  Men's transfer window summer 2020 â all deals from Europe's top five leagues Read more  âThere were thoughts at some stage,â he says. âDo I need to change now? I wonât play for ever and I want to enjoy football. I knew I still trained good and in my opinion â not everybody has to have the same opinion â I deserved a chance to play and to show that I can play at a high level. At some point if you see itâs not working between the sides then you have to make a clean cut. A nice cut, not a dirty cut.â  Yet Bayern, languishing in seventh place in the Bundesliga at one stage, have come roaring back since replacing Kovac with Hansi Flick in December. They have won their eighth successive title, thumped Bayer Leverkusen in the German Cup final and are one of the favourites to win the Champions League before the second leg of their last-16 tie against Chelsea at the Allianz Arena on Saturday night.  It is hard to find weaknesses in Bayernâs team. Their defence is solid and they have an intelligent midfield. The wingers, Serge Gnabry and Kingsley Coman, are excellent. Their Polish striker Robert Lewandowski has scored 51 goals for his club this season. Confidence is high and Boateng has felt the intensity return under Flick, who has revived Bayern with his expansive approach.  âHe brought back the joy for us as a team,â Boateng says. âEveryone can see we have a plan on the pitch. We enjoy playing together. He is really focused on the details. He is doing an amazing job.â  Boateng, who joined Bayern from Manchester City in 2011, feels hungry. He was in the team when Bayern last won the Champions League, beating Borussia Dortmund in the 2013 final at Wembley, and knows what it takes to become a European champion. Focus is key and Boateng says Bayern cannot afford to be complacent against Chelsea, even though they won Februaryâs first leg 3-0.  Bayern are not through quite yet and the disruption caused to the calendar by the coronavirus pandemic adds an awkward element. Whereas Chelsea finished their domestic campaign last weekend, losing the FA Cup final to Arsenal, Bayern have not played a competitive game since beating Leverkusen on 4 July.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest JÃ©rÃ´me Boateng says Bayern will not underestimate Chelsea despite taking a 3-0 lead into Saturdayâs second leg. Photograph: M Donato/FC Bayern/Getty Images  Boateng, who won the World Cup with Germany in 2014, is wary of rustiness. He stresses that Bayern still have to secure a spot in Lisbon, which will host the final rounds of the Champions League in a mini-tournament format from 12-23 August. âWe see Chelsea are in good form,â he says. âThey have improved. They will be stronger than the match in London. We have to be prepared. It starts at 0-0. Thatâs the next step. Donât talk about anything else.â  All the same it would take something extraordinary for Bayern to go out, especially with Lewandowski in scorching form. Lewandowski has never won the Champions League and would have been a contender to win the Ballon dâOr before this yearâs award was cancelled. âI have played for years now with him and this has been his best season so far,â Boateng says. âHeâs a world-class striker and would deserve to go for the Ballon dâOr. Thatâs unlucky for him and the rest who would be there. But I know him. Heâs really motivated for the Champions League.â  Becoming the best team in Europe is the aim for Bayern. Nobody in Germany can touch them; domestic success has come to feel routine. Although the Bundesliga is regarded as a talent factory for young players, it only enhances Bayernâs dominance when rivals lose their best players to the Premier League. Chelsea have signed Timo Werner from RB Leipzig and are trying to buy Kai Havertz from Leverkusen, while Manchester United are chasing Dortmundâs Jadon Sancho.  âThe Bundesliga teams give young talent time to grow,â Boateng says. âThey feel well treated in Germany. They have time to grow slowly. Sometimes as a young player you have times when you donât play so well. In some other countries I think it is really strict â they have a bad game, they are out for weeks. In Germany they take care of them.  âAll these players had really good seasons. Kai, Timo and Sancho are all really good talents. They have played for a long time now and I think they are all ready for the Premier League. Of course you have to show that first of all. Itâs not that easy because itâs a different league. The intensity is different. Itâs a different style of game. They have to see if they feel comfortable and like it there.â  It works differently for Bayern: they have signed the Germany winger Leroy SanÃ© from Manchester City. âHe will bring extra creativity,â Boateng says. âHeâs an outstanding player and is coming back from a long injury so maybe he needs a little bit of time to get back.

It was a time when the professional game in Europe was in turmoil. Trouble was writ large, with one threat of legal action following another with the frequency of knock-ons on a damp afternoon. Club owners, who quickly discovered that not only would there not be a quick return on their investments but they would also have to put in more and more because of unsustainable costs, decided in 1998 to take the then International Rugby Board to the European court charged with restrictive practices.  They did not get that far, but their complaints were eventually addressed. The French Rugby Federation and the Rugby Football Union, as they were free to do under the IRB regulations, allowed the clubs to negotiate commercial deals, including broadcasting, for their leagues â something that was later extended to the two European cup competitions â and run them.  The Breakdown | Vive la diffÃ©rence: French rugby tome still resonates 60 years on Read more  It meant clubs were no longer reliant on their unions selling the club game on the back of international rugby, but they have not become any more profitable, as the pandemic has highlighted. French clubs may be armed with a bumper television deal, but they are reliant on owners who as soon as they get involved in the sport apparently abandon the habits that helped them amass their fortunes.  And so their battleground has switched to the right of World Rugby to govern. The French clubsâ umbrella organisation, Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR), sent a letter on the eve of last weekâs council meeting when a vote on extending the Test window was to be held, declaring its intention to take legal action because of the âcatastrophicâ damage the move would cause to the Top 14.  Never mind that the clubs would have their Rugby Championship players throughout September and October with the tournament being postponed until the following month, LNR questioned the right of World Rugby to make the decision and demanded to know the individuals who had a vote.  The letter has not been followed up. There was no support from Premiership Rugby, where the majority of owners are focused on salvaging the season when it resumes next week rather than squandering money on lawyers, although it was curious that the news of LNRâs threat broke in England, suggesting there is an outlier there who does not feel bound by collective decision-making.  LNR complained that it was not part of the decision-making process, although its president, Paul Goze, was among the most vocal of the 50 participants during a virtual meeting at the end of June which was called to discuss the shape of the game in the future and involved players and clubs as well as unions.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Paul Goze is the outspoken president of the Ligue Nationale de Rugby. Photograph: Dominique Faget/AFP via Getty Images  The Top 14 and Premiership Rugby have been offered places in a compact working group which is being set up to look at the feasibility of a global calendar that would align games in the hemispheres, something that would not enhance their case in any legal claim that World Rugby was not inclusive.  LNR should get on with it and sue, although would it make its legal challenge in France, Ireland â where World Rugby is based â or elsewhere? When the Premiership clubs pulled out of Europe in 1998-99, pending the European court hearing, they expected the French to follow.  They did not, not least because under French law the clubs are only allowed to play in tournaments sanctioned by their governing body. Breaking away was never an option so was last weekâs letter of intent a serious threat or an attempt to squeeze the FFR, which is hosting the 2023 World Cup, out of more money because players will be on international duty for an estimated 100 days next season?  As unions battle to absorb losses piled up in the lockdown with even the richest of the unions, the RFU, forced to take a scythe to he game in the community, does not need the expense and distraction of a court case. Yet World Rugby, which is made up of 127 unions, keeps having its authority challenged by clubs in one or two countries. A ruling is needed.  The Breakdown | Northern exposure is timely but Japan see their future in the south Read more  At the June meeting, Goze was contemptuous of a global season that meant the European club campaign would start in January and run through the summer, which he insisted was not a time for rugby. He had clearly forgotten that during this century, there has been a Top 14 match in every month of the year, July included.  The argument is not being fought on principle. The prevailing feeling at World Rugby last week was that LNR was looking for financial compensation having agreed to a Test window of five, rather than six, weeks, a handout that would come from the community game.  This is a time when the game throughout the world is facing a fight for survival. French clubs are not, as they claim, facing a catastrophe because there are six Tests this autumn â but some unions would without them.  That the RFU has been forced to clobber its community game, just as Australia did at the start of the decade after opting to invest heavily in its professional game because players were being lured to Europe and Japan, shows this is an existential crisis.  The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.  Of course the club game is important, and France has a rich history, but international rugby has to come first. If a union falls, so does the game within its borders and that is why a global season â in which tournaments would be played in blocks and would, by removing overlaps, tempt clubs to take the strain off their wage bill by agreeing to central contracts â should be seriously considered.  It would remove the stress point, the battle over players, that has been the cause of so much posturing and writ-waving.

Atalanta, AtlÃ©tico Madrid, PSG and RB Leipzig have already secured their places in the mini tournament in Lisbon later this month but there are still four last-16 ties to complete, starting with games in Manchester and Turin on Friday night.  Manchester City v Real Madrid, Friday 8pm BST  Manchester City hold a 2-1 advantage against La Liga champions Real Madrid, who must score twice at the Etihad to have any chance of progressing. Madrid are not the attacking force they once were â Barcelona scored 16 goals more than them in the league this season â and Zinedine Zidane will no doubt set up his side to exploit Cityâs weakness on the counter rather than going at the hosts from the outset.  City had to come from behind to win at the BernabÃ©u with two goals in the last 12 minutes, but they were good value for the result, with Raheem Sterlingâs introduction in the second half proving the catalyst. Sergio AgÃ¼ero has been included in Cityâs 25-man squad for the Champions League but he has been ruled out of this game, leaving Pep Guardiola with a big decision about who should lead the line. Bernardo Silva operated as a false nine in Madrid, with Gabriel Jesus out on the left. Guardiola will probably try to spring another surprise on Friday.  Cityâs forwards will not have to worry about facing Sergio Ramos, who was sent off late in the first leg and is banned. Real Madrid have won 15 of the last 16 matches the centre-back has missed through suspension, but he is important in big games â in both boxes. Ramos has scored 13 goals this season, including five since the restart. His role as the clubâs penalty taker helps top up that tally, but this Real Madrid team are not exactly free-scoring. Ramos and Karim Benzema were the only two players to score more than four league goals for the club this season. Zidane will need another big performance from his star striker, who has enjoyed perhaps his best season in a Real Madrid shirt. Prediction: Manchester City to win on the night and qualify.  Juventus v Lyon, Friday 8pm BST  Lyon pulled off the biggest surprise of the first legs when they beat Juventus 1-0 back in February. However, they come into this game having played just one competitive fixture in the last five months: the Coupe de la Ligue final, which they lost to PSG on penalties. While Lyon have been missing out on Ligue 1 action in France, Maurizio Sarriâs side have won the league in Italy.  Leading Juventus to their ninth straight Serie A title was a triumph for Sarri, but the Old Lady were beaten by Napoli in the Coppa Italia final and only stuttered over the line in the league, finishing just a point above Inter after losing three of their last four games. They rested players towards the end of the campaign but this Juve team is not the dominant force of old in Italy.  PSG and Lyon warm up for Champions League in Coupe de la Ligue final Read more  Sarriâs side did not come out on top in any key metric â bar points, of course â in the league. They did not score the most goals, take the most shots, have the most possession, concede the fewest goals, concede the fewest shots or have the highest pass accuracy. The four teams that finished directly below them in the table all scored more goals. So much of Juveâs attacking play goes through the 35-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo. Paulo Dybala has been in fine form since the restart, but their midfield in particular looks suspect.  By contrast, Lyon have real emerging talent in that area, with Houssem Aouar and Bruno GuimarÃ£es the pick of the bunch. If Lyon can match Juventus for fitness, there may be an upset on the cards. Memphis Depay has returned after a long-term injury to give his team a boost, so expect another even battle. Prediction: Lyon to go through on away goals.  Barcelona v Napoli, 8pm Saturday  The first leg of this tie finished 1-1 in Naples. It was no classic, with just 15 shots, but Napoli will feel they had the better of the chances and should now be going to Camp Nou with a lead to protect. As it is this match is finely balanced between two sides that have fallen well short of their best in recent years.  While Barcelona were surrendering their league title to Real Madrid with relatively little fight after the restart, Napoli were having an even worse time. Having been Juveâs closest challenger in recent campaigns, they fell to a seventh-place finish this season. At least Barcelona can rely on Lionel Messi. Napoli, by comparison, really need a goalscorer. Their last nine goals have been scored by nine different players.  Around the world with ZÃ© Maria: from Brazil to Parma, Inter, Kenya and back Read more  Both of these teams have unfamiliar problems in attack. Barcelona are not as creative or incisive as they were at their peak. They are taking fewer and fewer shots every season. They only took 13 shots per game this season â the fourth year in a row that this figure has decreased. Lecce, who were relegated from Serie A, and Southampton both finished the season with more shots.  By contrast, Napoli took loads of shots but did not score many goals. They had 18.1 shots per game this season; only Manchester City (19.6) and Atalanta (18.7) had more in Europeâs top five leagues). Yet, Napoli were far from prolific. Arkadiusz Milik was their top scorer in Serie A this season with just 11 goals. They have certainly improved since the appointment of Gennaro Gattuso late last year, adding a Coppa Italia title to their trophy room, but their inability to convert chances is a problem. They lost 12 league matches this season, having lost just 14 in the previous three seasons combined.  BarÃ§a will be missing both Sergio Busquets and Arturo Vidal through suspension and Napoli could be without Lorenzo Insigne as the winger is struggling with a thigh injury. Prediction: Barcelona to win the game and go through.  Bayern Munich v Chelsea, 8pm Saturday  Having just lost the FA Cup final to Arsenal, Frank Lampard could probably do without a trip to Munich. Bayern were superb in the first leg at Stamford Bridge, winning 3-0 and surely guaranteeing their place in the quarter-finals. They have carried that form over the break to saunter to another Bundesliga title, winning every single match since the restart. They have not lost a game in 2020.  Hansi Flick has rejuvenated a side that seemed to be in a state of regression. In Thomas MÃ¼ller and Robert Lewandowski they have two forwards who are showing no signs of letting up in their thirties. Lewandowski scored 34 goals in the Bundesliga this season and MÃ¼ller finished the campaign with 21 assists. Serge Gnabry and converted full-back Alphonso Davies provide width going forwards, enabling Bayern to mix up their attack.  The view from the pubs at Griffin Park as Brentford miss out on promotion Read more  If Chelsea are to achieve the near impossible and win by three goals in Munich, they need to open up and attack. But that is not a good idea with their defence. A generally positive season could end in an ugly fashion. Chelsea have not kept a clean sheet in an away match in the Premier League since before Christmas and they conceded more goals (14) post-lockdown than any other team in the division. Having bolstered their attack in the transfer window already, improving their leaky defence is perhaps a bigger priority than trying to turn around this tie.

The energy industry regulator is expected on Friday to announce a sharp reduction to its cap on standard dual-fuel energy tariffs, which could knock between Â£85 and Â£100 a year from the average energy bill.  Ofgemâs energy price cap, which is designed to guarantee a fair price for energy customers, is expected to fall in line with weaker wholesale market prices following record low demand for gas and electricity during Britainâs Covid-19 lockdown.  Ofgem lowered its cap on average dual-fuel energy bill by Â£17 ahead of the summer months â from an average of Â£1,179 to Â£1,162 â for 11m households that use a standard variable energy tariff to buy their energy.  But industry analysts believe the cap will fall significantly more for the months from October to March because energy companies have been able to buy cheaper gas and power from the market in advance of winter.  Robert Buckley, at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight, said: âWe are expecting to see a significant decrease to the default price cap in Ofgemâs announcement, with a drop of potentially up to Â£100.â  The price cap plunge was expected following the âsignificant fall in wholesale pricesâ which were a direct result of the Covid-19 lockdown and the subsequent slump in energy demand, he added.  âFor example, when the lockdown was announced on 23 March, the day-ahead power contract dropped from Â£30 per megawatt-hour to Â£10/MWh on 20 April, where it hit an all-time low,â Buckley said.  Michael Lewis, the chief executive of E.ON UK, said he expected the price cap to fall by âat least Â£85 from this autumnâ.  âThat dramatic fall in demand for energy â including oil and gas â caused wholesale energy markets to fall rapidly since the price cap was last amended at the start of this year. Because of this we expect a significantly lower level when Ofgem updates the price cap next month. Such a move also means customers should see the benefit of lower bills in time for the colder months of the year,â he said.

The government gave permission on Thursday for the reestablished colony to remain in the area, the first wild breeding of beavers in 400 years and the first legally sanctioned reintroduction of an extinct native mammal to England.  Up to 15 family groups of beavers are now estimated to live on the Otter, after seven years in which their future success did not always look assured. Peter Burgess, director of conservation at Devon Wildlife Trust, which has overseen the reintroduction trial, told the Guardian: âThere have been some sleepless nights, and it was very stressful in the early stages. We knew the benefits, but things were hanging on a knife edge over securing the licence at the beginning.â  The beavers started out as interlopers, when a family group were found to be living on the River Otter in 2013, their origins unknown. They were threatened with removal, but the Devon Wildlife Trust and community groups stepped in and tried to show the beavers were European, rather than north American, and eventually gained a licence for a five-year trial, which was extended in February to conclude this month.  Beavers alter the landscape and ecosystems in and around waterways, with their dam-building helping to reduce pollution and boosting local wildlife populations, including fish and amphibians, according to a study from Exeter University. As the UKâs climate changes under global heating, droughts and devastating floods are likely to become more common, and beavers can help with both: their damming slows the speed of floods downhill when there is too much rainfall, and helps provide water storage that stops rivers running dry during droughts.  The dams also filter out pollutants and stop topsoil being washed away.  Key to the success of the River Otter project was getting local people and farmers involved and explaining the benefits beavers can bring, as well as providing support when needed, said Burgess. There were several incidents of localised flooding of farmland, when the landowners were concerned, but by providing expert support the reintroduction team were able to resolve the problems.  âIf landowners know thereâs someone they can pick up the phone to, it really helps,â Burgess said. âAnimals are much more likely to be welcomed if that is the approach.â  Play Video 1:13 Beavers in England: footage released of three mammals in River Otter â video  Beavers can grow to 20kg, but contrary to popular misconceptions, live on an exclusively vegetarian diet and do not eat fish.  Richard Benwell, chief executive of the Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: âItâs great to see that the reintroduction of beavers in this trial has resulted in a win-win for the local area, boosting wildlife and tackling man-made problems. The trial clearly proves the benefits of nature-based solutions to dealing with flooding, water quality and resilience to climate change.  âWe hope to see more such welcome projects introduced by government as part of flooding, water and climate planning.â  However, Phil Jarvis, chair of the environment forum at the National Farmersâ Union, warned that farmers would want to see an âexit strategyâ, as well as adequate funding and a long-term management plan, before any expansion. âBeavers can have a significant local impact on the countryside and farming; from creating dams that can undermine riverbanks, to impeding farmland drainage with waterlogged fields becoming unsuitable for grazing and cropping; all lead to serious implications on our ability to produce food,â he said.  âWe must see a well-thought through exit strategy if any major issues occur.â  The government said on Thursday it would consult later this year on the possibility of further reintroductions, and a national approach to the issue. An increasing number of farmers and conservationists are considering rewilding schemes for their land, and there are calls for reintroductions of animals from boar to lynx and wolves. A survey of members and supporters of the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust on lynx reintroduction received 4,500 replies, of which 68% were in favour.  No more releases in the wild will be allowed until the consultation is complete. Rebecca Pow, environment minister, said: âWe are firmly committed to providing opportunities to reintroduce formerly native species, such as beavers, where the benefits for the environment, people and the economy are clear.  âBut we also understand that there are implications for landowners, and take care to ensure that all potential impacts are carefully considered.â  â¢ This article was amended on 6 August 2020 to clarify in the first paragraph that the beaver colony discussed is the first to live wild in England for hundreds of years, not the UK.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/06/englands-first-wild-beavers-for-400-years-allowed-to-live-on-river-otter,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,9b060e3c0fff46901fcf221b06a2b9e1fbdbd0a17d70acabc3f98dd16aeb6036,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The number of visitors to UK retail destinations dropped by 39.4% in July compared with the same month a year ago, according to figures from Springboard, a data company that tracks footfall at consumer hotspots.  Despite an improvement of almost a fifth from June, in the best month for visitor numbers since February, the figures suggest intense pressure remains for the high street as people continued to stay away from town and city centres amid the ongoing health risks from Covid-19.  Non-essential shops began reopening in England and Northern Ireland in mid-June, and in Wales and Scotland later that month. Hotels, pub and restaurants in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland followed suit in July, though customers were only allowed back inside Welsh pubs and cafes this week.  Shoppers shun high streets in England and Northern Ireland, data shows Read more  With social distancing measures in place, consumers are now gradually returning to towns and city centres. However, Springboard said that during the first full month without tough lockdown measures, bricks and mortar destinations only managed to attract six out of every 10 people who visited last year.  The latest snapshot comes after growing numbers of big high street names announce a raft of shop closures and job losses, as retailers, pubs, hotels, restaurants and tourist attractions face a sharp decline in income caused by the pandemic.  Consumers are increasingly spending online, while a lack of tourists from overseas and office workers venturing into town and city centres has had an impact on visitor numbers.  The figures precede the launch of the governmentâs eat out to help out restaurant discount scheme, which has led to a sharp rise in visitor numbers since the start of August. However, coronavirus infections are starting to increase in some parts of Britain, leading to local lockdowns and fuelling concern among consumers.  Springboard also said it was too early to tell if the mandatory wearing of face coverings had affected footfall, because it was brought in at the end of the month.  The reopening of non-essential shops had the biggest impact on high street and shopping centre footfall, although both locations still have much more ground to make up on retail parks, where car parking and large shops make physical distancing easier.  Compared to a year earlier, July footfall was down by 47.2% on the high street, by as much as 42% in shopping centres and 19.9% in retail parks. In central London, which is more reliant than anywhere else in the UK on tourists and office workers, visitor numbers remained 69% lower than in 2019.  Retail sales in the UK have recovered close to pre-pandemic levels driven by the release of pent-up demand, as shoppers made purchases in June that had been put on hold during lockdown. Spending on food, DIY and at garden centres rose sharply, although sales of clothes are still sharply down on a year ago.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/06/shoppers-steer-clear-of-high-streets-despite-lockdown-lifting,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,c8a6cb57f7258027a34c9d230b5f190b974a3948ccd02f97e54508d463305e06,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

In the second evidence session of the new all-party parliamentary group (APPG) for coronavirus led by a cross-party group of MPs, Downing Street was accused of being âasleep at the wheelâ and of mounting a âsluggishâ response to the coronavirus.  In testimony on Wednesday, which at times left APPG members visibly emotional, four relatives from Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice â a group of 1,450 people who have lost loved ones as a result of the pandemic â described the deaths of their loved ones.  The founder of the campaign, Jo Goodman, showed MPs a picture of her smiling father, Stuart, holding copies of his first published book shortly before he died after contracting Covid. Explaining that while he was 72, suffered from heart issues, mild asthma and was undergoing diagnosis for cancer, she stressed that he âstill had a huge amount to live forâ.  She added: âMy dad did begin isolating a week or so prior to lockdown. However, he had a scheduled appointment to receive his cancer diagnosis on 18 March. So he was in a crowded waiting room full of vulnerable patients, there was no social distancing and staff werenât provided with any PPE whatsoever. This is five days before lockdown.â  The following week he began his chemotherapy treatment, Goodman explained, but a few days later he started to develop coronavirus symptoms. He died on 2 April in hospital, with his shielding letter arriving nine days after his death. âAs a family we felt that too little had been done by the government, and too late, to protect my dad and people like him,â she said, leading her to set up the campaign group.  She added: âI feel that at the start of the pandemic the government was very much caught asleep at the wheel and Iâm not entirely sure the government has fully woken up yet.â  Goodman revealed that earlier letters to the prime minister, Boris Johnson, highlighting the inquiry call and requesting a meeting with bereaved relatives in the group had been turned down, saying she felt they had been âswept under the carpetâ. She urged Johnson to âspeak to usâ so that âbereaved familiesâ voices are heardâ.  Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice is calling for an urgent, wide-ranging, judge-led public statutory inquiry. Last month, Johnson pledged to hold an independent inquiry but no details of the format, scope or timing of the inquiry have been released.  Eight Tory MPs and peers â including former ministers David Davis and Harriett Baldwin â are among more than 50 politicians who have joined the APPG, which is holding a rapid inquiry over the summer into the governmentâs response to the Covid-19 pandemic as the official UK death toll tops 46,000. Liberal Democrat MP and chair of the APPG inquiry, Layla Moran, said: âIt is unacceptable that bereaved families have been met with such a wall of indifference from No 10. The prime minister must agree to listen to families who have lost loved ones to coronavirus and take their concerns on board.â  During the evidence session on Wednesday, Labour MP Sharon Hodgson was seen wiping her eyes during testimony.  Hannah Brady, 24, whose 55-year-old father, Shaun, who had no underlying health conditions, died from Covid in May after spending 42 nights in ICU on a ventilator, also told the APPG: âDad had a lot of reasons to live; his daughters, his family, his community, his charity work. But he only needed one reason to die: the governmentâs sluggish response to the threat of Covid-19 to our country.â  Fighting back tears, psychotherapist Kathryn de Prudhoe held up a picture of her 60-year-old father, Tony Clay, explaining that he died in hospital from Covid 23 days after the picture was taken. âHe was fit and healthy and had no underlying health conditions that we knew of,â she said, explaining that he had flown to the UK from his rural home in France on 13 March , hoping it was safer than being in mainland Europe.  âMy dad was on a low dose of blood pressure medication and he had a family history of heart disease and it appears now that they were risk factors he was unaware of. I believe that with clearer messaging, more honest communication about who was at risk, and earlier lockdown, travel restrictions, border controls, test, track and trace, and a health service that was equipped to attend to people other than the most critically ill, my dad would still be alive.â  Meanwhile, during the evidence session people who have endured long-term forms of Covid-19 also spoke about the debilitating impact of the disease. Claire Hastie, founder of the Long Covid Support Group which has more than 15,000 followers on Facebook, said she had been left wheelchair-bound due to the virus. The 48-year-old single mother-of-three, whose children have all caught the virus, told the APPG: âI used to cycle 13 miles a day on my commute and now I canât even walk 13 metres.â  A government spokesperson said: âThis has been an unprecedented global outbreak and every death from the virus is a tragedy. The government has acted to protect lives, incomes and the most vulnerable in our society. In the future there will be an opportunity for us to look back and learn some profound lessons. But at the moment, the most important thing to do is to focus on responding to the current situation.â",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/05/asleep-at-the-wheel-families-of-covid-19-dead-lament-no-10-response,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,29eca5b921a230d288a9a0d00c8f8d768d1918eacf6917ea261ba761a139c488,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The Welsh language commissioner, Aled Roberts, expressed concern about the trend and called for the devolved government to take urgent action to reverse the fall.  Three years ago ministers in Wales launched a plan to almost double the number of Welsh speakers by 2050, with a key plank of the strategy being a steady increase the number of professionals teaching through the language.  But the commissionerâs report says: âThere has been a striking reduction in the last five years in the number of newly qualified school teachers (NQTs) who can speak Welsh or are able to work through the medium of Welsh.â  There has been a drop overall in the number of NQTs in Wales, the report points out. But it continues: âThe 23% reduction of NQTs able to speak Welsh, and 27% reduction in those able to work through the medium of Welsh, far exceeds the 8% reduction in total NQTs.â  According to the report, there were 285 NQTs able to work through the medium of Welsh last year, compared with 388 in 2015.  Roberts said: âIn order to be close to meeting the targets set by the government, we need a radical increase in the number of teachers in Wales able to teach through the medium of Welsh. Urgent action is required.â  Roberts said it was worrying that a âsignificant numberâ of teachers who are fluent or fairly fluent in Welsh do not teach in Welsh. He said this included people who grew up in English-speaking households, left school able to speak Welsh fluently but do not have the confidence to teach in the language.  The commissioner makes a string of recommendations including setting targets relating to Welsh language skills for providers of teacher training and doing more to promote grants to encourage more people to learn to teach through Welsh.  Dilwyn Roberts-Young, the general secretary of the Welsh teaching union UCAC, expressed concern at the figures. He said: âThe Welsh language commissionerâs report rightly emphasises the need to have a clear vision for recruiting and retention of teachers and to facilitate pathways to learning Welsh and developing existing Welsh language ability.  âIn attracting potential teachers to the profession there is a need to look at broader issues of appropriate salaries, reduced workload and clear career pathways, which can ensure that teaching in Wales is a valued profession.â  A Welsh government spokesperson said recruiting Welsh-medium teachers remained a priority. The spokesperson said the government provided âsubstantial financial incentivesâ and ran marketing campaigns to attract new Welsh-medium teachers.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/06/fall-in-welsh-capable-teachers-risks-missing-language-target-report-warns,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,3691f80e96e6d6370a9c07fb663cfaeea0c385b42efd261059d58efaea66db76,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The Runnymede Trust found that people from BAME backgrounds faced greater barriers in shielding from Covid-19, with employment, public transport, and multigenerational and overcrowded households all risk factors.  Those from BAME backgrounds are over-represented in Covid-19 diagnosis, severe illness and deaths. A Public Health England report published in June found people from Bangladeshi backgrounds faced the greatest risk of dying from the disease.  The findings of the survey of 2,585 adults in Britain, including 750 from BAME backgrounds, suggest that one of the main reasons ethnic minorities are at greater risk of dying from Covid-19 than their white counterparts is that they are more exposed to coronavirus.  BAME communities â in particular Bangladeshi, Pakistani and black African groups â are more likely to live in larger, multigenerational or overcrowded households, reducing their ability to shield and self-isolate.  BAME workers disproportionately hit by UK Covid-19 downturn, data shows Read more  They are also over-represented in key worker roles: 28% of BAME respondents classified themselves as key workers, with the highest percentage among people of black African backgrounds (38%), compared with 23% of white British people surveyed.  Previous studies have shown that people from BAME groups are over-represented in these jobs, particularly in frontline health and social care roles.  People from minority ethnic backgrounds were also more than twice as likely as white people to have had to use public transport during lockdown, increasing their risk of exposure to the virus.  BAME key workers were more likely to report feeling they faced additional risks through not having adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) at work. This was highest among respondents from a Bangladeshi background (50%).  BAME people were also more likely to feel they were being given tasks that exposed them to the virus, and to say they had been ignored after raising concerns about safety.  Furthermore, the report found important government public health messaging aimed at reducing the transmission of coronavirus, including key slogans such as Stay Home, was not reaching all BAME communities.  BAME respondents were also less likely to be aware of economic measures including the furlough scheme, and measures allowing those out of work because of the crisis to claim universal credit, and making statutory sick pay available from the first day of self-isolating.  The Runnymede Trust said these risk factors helped explain why certain groups had been disproportionately affected during the pandemic. Dr Zubaida Haque, the interim director of the trust, told the BBC: âWhile we have all faced the same storm, we are not in the same boat.  âOur findings explain why we are seeing outbreaks in places like Leicester, densely populated areas with multigenerational households. Many people are also struggling to pay bills, so have to leave their homes to work. Temporary housing and financial support should be made available to facilitate those who need to self-isolate.â  Recommendations include risk assessments for BAME employees and improvements in the NHS test-and-trace system reaching the most vulnerable, including working closer with local authorities, which already have trusted relationships with their communities.  The Department of Health and Social Care said: âWe know that Covid-19 has had a disproportionate effect on people from BAME backgrounds, and, following the findings of the Public Health England report, the equalities minister is now taking forward vital work to tackle these disparities and protect our most vulnerable communities from the impact of the virus.â",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/05/british-bame-groups-face-greater-barriers-than-white-people-in-avoiding-covid-19,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,324fc4b65ee67897d32f4bf45f8ef932f150c76d395bc2fcc5d835811dba757b,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The first minister said all pubs and restaurants in the city had to close from 5pm on Wednesday, as she barred people from visiting other households indoors and urged residents to avoid non-essential journeys greater than five miles.  Health officials in NHS Grampian named 32 pubs, restaurants and golf clubs visited by some of the 54 people infected in the outbreak, as the scope of their test-and-trace investigation widened to include several businesses in Aberdeenshire.  The health board said a further 36 infections had emerged overnight in the Grampian area, although it remained unclear how many were directly linked to the Aberdeen cluster, which began late last week at the Hawthorn Bar in the city centre.  NHS Grampian announced on Wednesday evening that it had suspended all visits to hospitals in Aberdeen with immediate effect, including Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the cityâs childrenâs and maternity hospitals, to protect patients and staff.  While hospitals in Aberdeenshire and Moray were unaffected, the NHS board said the ban extended to anyone in Aberdeen who was a designated visitor for patients in hospitals outside the city, even if less than five miles from their home.  The Aberdeenshire businesses involved in the NHS Grampian investigation included the Cock & Bull gastropub close to Donald Trumpâs golf course near Balmedie north of Aberdeen, the Aboyne golf club 30 miles west of Aberdeen and the Marine hotel in Stonehaven, 16 miles south of the city.  As Police Scotland confirmed it would increase patrols in Aberdeen to enforce the lockdown, Sturgeon said that extending the lockdown to other places was a live issue.  âThere will be ongoing analysis of the âtest and protectâ data to see whether it may be necessary to extend these restrictions to some parts of Aberdeenshire,â she said. âBut we will only do that if we deem it necessary and we havenât taken that decision yet.â  A local MSP, Lewis Macdonald, said expanding the lockdown was logical. âThe whole point of test and trace is to trace and [administrative] boundaries should play no part in determining the extent of the lockdown,â he said.  âThe virus doesnât respect boundaries and nor should the actions taken to contain it. It is important action is immediate and itâs effective.â  Sturgeon said urgent action was essential to prevent a much wider outbreak. âI know this is deeply, deeply unwelcome news for people in Aberdeen and Iâm deeply sorry that weâre in this position,â she said during her daily coronavirus briefing.  âWe need to take decisive action now in order to prevent a larger outbreak and further harm later on.â  She said the restrictions, which followed a local lockdown around five towns and villages in south-west Scotland last month, and an outbreak affecting 13 people in Inverclyde late last month, would be in place until they are reviewed next Wednesday.  The lockdown would not affect hotel restaurants that serve those staying at the hotel or takeaways, while the ban on non-essential travel would exclude those who needed to travel for work and education. She also urged people not to travel into Aberdeen unless it was essential.  Sturgeon said she still hoped Aberdeenâs schools would reopen on 17 August. Any employers whose staff had been previously furloughed during the UK-wide lockdown could be put back on furlough for the duration of this local lockdown.  The Hawthorn has been closed for a deep clean, but anxieties about the behaviour of some Aberdonians accelerated over the weekend after footage emerged of large groups of mainly younger people drinking in close proximity at an outdoor bar on Union Street, the cityâs main shopping street.  Sturgeon said the identification of numerous bars and pubs in the outbreak showed the outbreak was rapidly accelerating, she said, with cases appearing to double every two days or so, and it suggested drinkers were going on pub crawls.  âOur precautionary and careful judgment is that we need to take decisive action now, difficult as that undoubtedly is, in order to try to contain this outbreak and prevent further harm later on,â she said.  âAs I said earlier, this is about doing all we can to ensure our children can return to schools next week. Acting now, we judge, gives us the time and the space to protect the ability of our young people to return to education.â  Tracy Black, director of the business organisation CBI Scotland, said: âAberdeen wonât be the last local area that faces renewed restrictions in the coming months, so the Scottish government must do everything it can to provide clear, timely advice and appropriate support to firms and individuals.

Only one-third (34%) of UK white-collar employees have gone back to work, lagging far behind their European counterparts, where almost three-quarters of staff (68%) have done so, according to analysis from US bank Morgan Stanleyâs research unit AlphaWise.  French and Italian companies have led the charge in bringing their teams back to the workplace, as 83% of French office staff have returned, followed by 76% in Italy.  In England, companies have been urged to encourage employees to return to their workplaces from this week by Boris Johnson, although early reports suggest only a relatively small number have heeded the call thus far. The recommendation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is for staff to continue to work from home where possible.  It is unclear whether the UKâs slower return to the office could be related to the earlier impositions of lockdown and subsequent easing of restrictions in the four other European countries.  In all five European countries, office workers have continued to work remotely for longer than employees based in other kinds of workplaces.  Technology, including high-speed internet and video conferencing apps, has enabled successful working from home for many companies which usually occupy offices, and as a result firms have been more reluctant to ask their employees to return.  Half of all British workers surveyed (52%) have returned to their normal workplace, compared with 82% of French employees and 72% across the major European economies surveyed.  Workers in London are much more likely to continue to work remotely than their counterparts in other European capitals including the Paris region, Madrid, Berlin or Rome.  Almost three-quarters (69%) of employees in the British capital have not returned to their workplace, compared with only 26% of workers in Paris, and just 22% of employees based in Barcelona.  Similarly, about half (49%) of London office workers are working from home for five days a week, compared with 33% in Madrid, and 30% in Rome and the Italian region of Lazio.  The Morgan Stanley survey was conducted in mid-July, before the government updated its guidance for businesses.  Boris Johnson told companies in England it would be up to them to decide from 1 August when and how to bring back staff and also scrapped the previous guidance to avoid public transport.  However, recent analysis by the Guardian showed that several of Britainâs largest office occupiers have not heeded the governmentâs call.  Many companies cited uncertainty about asking their employees to use public transport and the need for childcare during school summer holidays as reasons not to end remote working before September at the earliest.  The government is keen to get workers back into corporate buildings to support smaller businesses in many towns and cities, from sandwich shops to dry cleaners, that provide services to the countryâs army of office workers.  High street retailer WH Smith announced on Wednesday it would cut 1,500 jobs because of struggling sales in its travel business, which includes branches at airports, as well as small kiosk-style stores in bus and railway stations.  Sandwich chain Pret a Manger said in July it would permanently close 30 outlets and could cut 1,000 jobs after sales plummeted as a result of continued working from home.  Workers across mainland Europe have similar views on where and how they will work in future.  The vast majority (82%) of more than 4,300 office workers questioned in all five countries who have worked from home during the pandemic would like to continue remote working.  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk  Yet employeesâ desire to work remotely does not necessarily spell the end of the office.

Public Health England (PHE) issued the alert to drug treatment services and healthcare providers about the availability of illicit tablets being sold as benzodiazepines, such as Xanax and diazepam, which can be prescribed to treat anxiety or insomnia.  Most of the tablets causing concern are blue, but do come in various colours, and may stain peopleâs mouths, PHE said, while some are marked or known as DAN 5620, T-20, TEM 20, Bensedin and MSJ.  PHE is aware of 12 cases in the past four months where the drugs have been toxicologically confirmed in pills linked to either hospitalisation or death and the agency is tracking around 30 cases where information is not yet fully available. Since the alert was issued, PHE has had more reports, showing the pills are in circulation across the country.  The Guardian heard from a man who spent four weeks in a coma after taking a T-20 tablet. âI took two of them T-20s and it put me in a coma,â he said. âThey wiped me out. Donât buy them, donât take them.â  Coronavirus lockdown caused sharp increase of insomnia in UK Read more  Another man said he was detained in a mental health hospital after taking T-20s, which he bought for Â£1 each. âI took about 10 or 15 a day for three weeks. I was hallucinating, seeing things that werenât there. Seeing my dead family members and stuff walking down the street, I was talking to people who werenât there.â  In April, as the Covid-19 pandemic unfolded in the UK, drug experts warned that people who use drugs were increasingly turning to benzodiazepines as an alternative to other drugs that were short in supply.  The alert said two different groups of people appear to be increasingly using illicit benzos: dependent opioid users, and teenagers and young adults.  The alert said: âThere is significant evidence from toxicology results of illicit tablets being sold as diazepam, temazepam and alprazolam linked to recent hospitalisations and deaths, and from police seizures, that some illicit drugs sold as benzodiazepines are causing harm.â  Dr Rachel Britton, director of pharmacy at We Are With You, which provides drug and alcohol treatment services in 80 locations in England and Scotland, said: âYou canât get Xanax prescribed on the NHS so if someone offers it to you itâs extremely likely to be illicitly produced.  âTesting has shown that these fake pills can often contain different substances in differing strengths, meaning the chances of overdose are far higher.  âDue to the dangers, we are urging people to avoid taking these drugs. Unlike opiates, there is no readily available overdose reversal drug for these fake tablets within communities. The drug used to reverse benzodiazepines is carried by ambulance crews and in hospitals so itâs vital that anyone feeling unwell after taking these tablets seeks medical help.â  In many cases where hospitalisation or death has occurred, other drugs were involved.

On Wednesday, the White House said it was stepping up efforts to purge âuntrustedâ Chinese apps from US digital networks, calling the Chinese-owned short-video app TikTok and messenger app WeChat âsignificant threats.â  TikTok faces a deadline of 15 September to either sell its US operations to Microsoft or face an outright ban. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said a US campaign called âClean Networkâ would focus on five areas and include steps to prevent various Chinese apps, as well as Chinese telecoms companies, from accessing sensitive information on American citizens and businesses.  In the run-up to Trumpâs November re-election bid, US-China ties are at the lowest ebb in decades. Relations are strained over the global coronavirus pandemic, Chinaâs military buildup in the South China Sea, its increasing control over Hong Kong and treatment of Uighur Muslims, as well as Beijingâs massive trade surpluses and technological rivalry.  Disinformation seeded by foreign actors has emerged as a burning concern for American politicians and technologists since the 2016 presidential election, when Russian government-linked actors pumped hundreds of thousands of deceptive messages into the social media ecosystem.  Many have spent the past four years trying to avoid a repeat of 2016, with companies like Google and Facebook issuing regular updates on how theyâre combating online propaganda.  In an interview with state news agency Xinhua on Wednesday, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi accused Pompeo of trying to âdrawn an iron curtainâ and create new divisions, calling actions against TikTok a âa textbook case of bullyingâ.  âAnyone can see through clearly that the intention of the US is to protect itâs monopoly position in technology and to rob other countries of their proper right to development,â said Wang.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/aug/06/google-deletes-2500-china-linked-youtube-channels-over-disinformation,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,2d8c57b48c060a45a13be10c14ba3d3b2c04cfc519dd9c4805298d2b4e135069,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Seven workers at the Ok Tedi mine near the Indonesian border have tested positive to Covid-19. The mine has traced the infections back to a single worker who is believed to have contracted the virus from a person who had flown from Port Moresby to Kiunga on a commercial flight late last month.  âThe employee is currently working in our operations, travelling to and from work on buses. It is likely that more people have been infected, giving rise to an unacceptable risk of accelerated transmission within the Ok Tedi workforce,â the mineâs chief executive Musje Werror said in a statement.  Ok Tedi mine â a hugely profitable gold and copper mine worth billions to the PNG governmentâs already-parlous finances â will be shut for âat least 14 days to limit further transmission and allow contact tracing, isolation and testing procedures to be implementedâ.  PNG has now recorded 153 confirmed cases â low by global standards â but a record jump of 39 in a day, and up from 11 just three weeks ago. There have also been two deaths.  Professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Papua New Guinea, Dr Glen Mola, said PNGâs new case numbers were to be expected, and would worsen. Covid-19 was slow to reach PNG initially, he said, and the country is now showing the rising trends most countries were exhibiting two or three months ago.  âIn August we will have hundreds of positive test infections and perhaps thousands in September to December. But we must stay calm and handle things as best we can; fear of the epidemic could be worse than the actual epidemic itself,â Mola said.  âLetâs hope we can âflatten the curveâ sufficiently to allow our health system to not fall over, but without locking down the country so much that the whole country âfalls overâ economically.â  A significant number of cases have been recorded among health workers in the capital, Port Moresby, raising concerns that medical staff are not being given adequate protective equipment or that hygiene protocols are failing.

Currently, 86 inmates and 21 members of staff have tested positive for Covid-19, according to the Malawi prison authorityâs spokesperson, Chimwemwe Shaba. There are 71 cases in one prison in Blantyre alone.  However, campaigners believe the true numbers are likely to be higher.  Seven organisations have written to the government to request the decongestion of prisons, noting that a space which is supposed to accommodate 5,000 prisoners is currently holding 14,000.  Victor Mhango, executive director for the Centre for Human Rights, Education, Advice and Assistance, said: âCovid-19 is a big problem in our prisons. The figures that are coming from there are from a small sample that has been tested. Had they tested each and every prisoner, you could be surprised. The situation is just huge.â  In the letter to the president, Mhango suggested the president consider a number of factors. âWe are talking of terminally ill prisoners. We have so many prisoners with TB [tuberculosis]. We have been hearing from health experts that if this virus can is contracted by someone with certain diseases, the possibility of someone dying is very high. We are also taking of old age, we have some people are 65, 70, 80 years old who are in prison.â  Currently, Malawi has registered 4,361 Covid-19 cases with 128 deaths and 2,047 recoveries, according to the health ministry. But many people believe this number is an underestimate due to low testing capacity.  Shaba said there had been ongoing discussions between the authorities concerning the situation and he believes some of the prisoners could be pardoned. âOne of the challenges is an obvious fact that our prisons are congested and the virus can easily spread. The second challenge is the lack of testing kits since we donât have adequate kits to intensify both random and mass testing.â  The new president of Malawi, Lazarus Chakwera, has acknowledged that Covid-19 is a serious challenge, pointing out that the pandemic could affect his ability to keep his election promises in the short term.  Speaking to the Guardian, the minister of homeland security, Richard Chimwendo Banda , acknowledged that the situation in the prisons is deteriorating because of overcrowding. âIt pleased the president to form a special committee to look into the matter.

The research assessed nearly 7,000 animal communities on six continents and found that the conversion of wild places into farmland or settlements often wipes out larger species. It found that the damage benefits smaller, more adaptable creatures that also carry the most pathogens that can pass to humans.  The assessment found that the populations of animals hosting what are known as zoonotic diseases were up to 2.5 times bigger in degraded places, and that the proportion of species that carry these pathogens increased by up to 70% compared with in undamaged ecosystems.  Humans populations are being increasingly hit by diseases that originate in wild animals, such as HIV, Zika, Sars and Nipah virus. Since the coronavirus pandemic began, there have been a series of warnings from the UN and WHO that the world must tackle the cause of these outbreaks â the destruction of nature â and not just the health and economic symptoms.  In June, experts said the Covid-19 pandemic was an âSOS signal for the human enterpriseâ, while in April the worldâs leading biodiversity experts said even more deadly disease outbreaks were likely unless nature was protected.  The new analysis is the first to show how the demolition of wild places, as the worldâs population and consumption grows, leads to changes in animal populations that increase the risk of disease outbreaks. The research demonstrates that disease surveillance and healthcare needs to be ramped up in those areas where nature is being ravaged, the scientists said.  âAs people go in and, for example, turn a forest into farmland, what theyâre doing inadvertently is making it more likely for them to be in contact with an animal that carries disease,â said David Redding, of the ZSL Institute of Zoology in London, who was one of the research team. The work is published in the journal Nature.  Redding said the costs of disease were not being taken into account when deciding to convert natural ecosystems: âYouâve then got to spend a lot more money on hospitals and treatments.â A recent report estimated that just 2% of the costs of the Covid-19 crisis would be needed to help prevent future pandemics for a decade.  âThe Covid-19 pandemic has awakened the world to the threat that zoonotic diseases pose to humans,â said Richard Ostfeld, at the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, US, and Felicia Keesing at Bard College, US, in a commentary in Nature.  âWith this recognition has come a widespread misperception that wild nature is the greatest source of zoonotic disease,â they said. â[This research] offers an important correction: the greatest zoonotic threats arise where natural areas have been converted to croplands, pastures and urban areas. The patterns the researchers detected were striking.â  The reason for species such as rodents and bats simultaneously thriving in ecosystems damaged by humans and also hosting the most pathogens is probably because they are small, mobile, adaptable and produce lots of offspring rapidly.  âThe ultimate example is the brown rat,â Redding said. These fast-living species have an evolutionary strategy that favours large numbers of offspring ahead of a high survival rate for each one, which means they invest relatively little in their immune systems. âIn other words, creatures that have rat-like life histories seem to be more tolerant of infections than do other creatures,â said Ostfeld and Keesing.  âIn contrast, an elephant has a calf every couple of years,â said Redding. âIt has to make sure that offspring survives, so it is born with a very strong and adaptive immune system.â  The analysis found that small, perching birds were also disease hosts that do well in habitats suffering from the impact of human activities. Such birds can be reservoirs of diseases such as West Nile virus and a type of chikungunya virus.  Humans have already affected more than half of the Earthâs habitable land. Prof Kate Jones, of the University College London, and also part of the research team, said: âAs agricultural and urban lands are predicted to continue expanding in the coming decades, we should be strengthening disease surveillance and healthcare provision in those areas that are undergoing a lot of land disturbance, as they are increasingly likely to have animals that could be hosting harmful pathogens.â",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/05/deadly-diseases-from-wildlife-thrive-when-nature-is-destroyed-study-finds,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,1a9f6227f86c537fd3b86e6fe15639cdc160f7a6b4a56c533fd5288fd754d89e,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

A report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) into an outbreak at a summer camp in Georgia suggests children â even asymptomatic cases â may play an important role in community transmission of Covid-19.  The claim contradicts a number of earlier studies where the consensus appeared to be that children rarely transmit the virus between themselves or to other people.  This week 260 employees in one of Georgiaâs biggest school districts were barred from entering their schools to plan for reopening because they either had the virus or had been in contact with an infected individual.  The disclosure comes after an official report of what appeared to have been a âsuper-spreaderâ event, also in Georgia, where more than 200 teenagers attending an overnight YMCA summer camp were also infected.  Although the camp, involving about 600 young people, followed sanitation rules including staff wearing masks, campers were not required to, and local health officials said ârelatively largeâ groups of children aged between six and 19 slept in communal cabins.  According to a report by Georgia health officials and the CDC, the outbreak occurred in late June and was identified after a teenage staff member developed symptoms. After testing 344 attendees, 260 were found to be positive.  Equally troubling, according to the report, was the fact that â contrary to earlier theories about the spread of the disease in children â younger children, as well as those who spent longer at the camp, appeared more likely to be infected.  The CDC report said: âThe findings demonstrate that Sars-CoV-2 spreads efficiently in a youth-centric overnight setting, resulting in high attack rates among persons in all age groups, despite efforts by camp officials to implement most recommended strategies to prevent transmission.â  The report added: âAsymptomatic infection was common and potentially contributed to undetected transmission, as has been previously reported. This investigation adds to the body of evidence demonstrating that children of all ages are susceptible to Sars-CoV-2 infection and, contrary to early reports, might play an important role in transmission.â  Amid a vigorous debate in the UK and elsewhere about the reopening of schools, the Georgia events have highlighted how little is known about the spread of Covid in younger age groups, with much of the focus in recent months on older and more vulnerable populations.  Part of the issue, as the Harvard epidemiologist William Hanage explained last month, is that many countries closed schools early in the pandemic, leaving little opportunity to study if and how the virus spread among children, and studies that had been made of children and transmission were sometimes problematic.  âHousehold studies have typically found that children are rarely infected and rarely transmit. But those household studies all suffer from bias, which is that they start by identifying a person who was infected and then testing the people around them.  âNow, because children are much less likely to have severe disease or even noticeable symptoms at all, that means that an adult is more likely to be identified as the index case. And then when you go around and you sample the kids, you find the kid and you assume that the adult must have transmitted to the kid.  âThe other thing about it is that the closure of schools and other interaction, other actions that people have taken as part of social distancing, limit the opportunity of children to make contacts along which the virus could transmit. So, weâre not seeing the types of interactions that we might expect if schools are opened.â  Hanage summarised the conundrum to the Guardian: âIf community transmission is low, the costs to kids of keeping schools closed are much greater than keeping them open.  âHowever if community transmission is high or increasing, opening schools can only add to it. Itâs not clear by how much ... After all, the fact that kids have much less severe disease means that in the event of a large transmission event in an elementary school you are much more likely to detect the adults than the kids.â  The recent events in Georgia also appear to mirror the experience of Israel, where a rapid and full reopening of schools has contributed to a resurgence of the virus there.  Israel was seen as a success story at the start of the pandemic after imposing a strict lockdown in March that curbed the spread of coronavirus. However, measures were gradually eased, with the government keen to limit the financial fallout and get parents back to work, and children returned to school in May.  But by the end of that month coronavirus was spreading through classrooms and authorities shut about 100 schools before the summer break, ordering thousands of pupils and teachers into quarantine.  The hardest-hit school was Jerusalemâs Gymnasium Rehavia, where 153 students and 25 staff tested positive, with some criticising the handling of the outbreak.  âAt the entrance to the school, everyone just collected and entered as we were all close to each other,â said one pupil, Amit Sason, quoted by the Jerusalem Post.  The need for greater social distancing at schools and workplaces was highlighted last month by Israelâs public health chief, Siegal Sadetzki, when she quit in protest at the governmentâs handling of the crisis.  And while the government has imposed some new measures, such as closing malls at weekends and limiting attendance at places of worship, summer schools have stayed open.  In Jerusalem, Anya Zhuravel Segalâs children, aged three and five, have been among those attending summer programmes as they wait for the school year to start in September.  âI really want them to open and I want things to be as normal as possible. I think the danger to our mental health [of staying at home] is more detrimental than the virus,â said Zhuravel Segal, who works as a fundraiser.  But after being encouraged by the governmentâs initial response to coronavirus, she said officials had âlost the wayâ.  âThe way this crisis has been handled over the past two months has been my biggest disappointment in Israeli public life,â she said.  â¢ This articleâs headline was amended on 6 August 2020 to one more appropriate to the text.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/05/covid-19-may-spread-more-easily-schools-than-thought-report-warns,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,40da35d3a83bd6c7da95cae5f41c0a331251712944a61ecd3129ba25bd977ab5,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

In off-the-cuff remarks at the White House on Tuesday, Trump called the blast a âterrible attackâ.  âIâve met with some of our great generals and they just seem to feel that this was not some kind of a manufacturing explosion type of event,â the president told reporters. âIt was a bomb of some kind.â  Visual guide: how explosion caused mass casualties and devastation across Beirut Read more  Soon after, CNN quoted Pentagon officials as saying there was no evidence of any attack, raising the question of where Trump got his information. Lebanese officials were reported to have sought urgent clarification from US diplomats.  The defence secretary, Mark Esper, said on Wednesday: âMost believe that it was an accident as reported.â But he added that the Pentagon was still gathering information about the explosion.  In a statement about Beirut, the state department referred to the âhorrible explosionâ but made no mention of an attack.  The Beirut government says the explosion was caused by a warehouse full of ammonium nitrate igniting, though the initial cause of the fire is still unclear.  The White House gave no guidance on Wednesday as to whether Trump had received a top secret intelligence briefing, had seen something on Twitter â or just made up the claim and imagined a conversation with US generals.  On Wednesday the president said the question was still unanswered.  âI can tell you whatever happened, itâs terrible. But they donât really know what it is.

I donât think anybody can say right now.â  âIâve heard it both ways,â he added.  It has become the norm for US officials to quietly correct the thicket of mistakes and lies embedded in Trumpâs daily discourse, but applied to a fragile and volatile corner of the world, the stakes are higher.  âI would advise against listening to Donald Trump at the best of times, let alone the worst,â Tom Fletcher, a former British ambassador to Lebanon, said.  âYou canât show up unprepared for the Middle East. Careless messaging from the White House has consequences, even when no one takes the tweeter seriously. I hope future American presidents will try to help put out fires in the region, not fan them.â  The Democratic senator Chris Murphy said on Twitter: âBefore the explosion, Lebanon was already in dire crisis, with a collapsed economy and sectarian tensions at a boiling point.  âI canât imagine anything worse right now than Trump making unfounded claims of an âattackâ,â Murphy added. âCould set off something truly awful in Lebanon.â  The worst nightmare looming over the Trump administration is that the president might shoot from the hip at the White House podium during a nuclear standoff.  In his documentary-style novel, The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks Against the United States, academic and nuclear expert Jeffrey Lewis imagines a scenario in which the US slides into a devastating conflict, propelled by the presidentâs impulsive tweets and remarks.  âI would feel a lot better if the real world looked less like my book,â Lewis said on Wednesday.",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/05/donald-trump-beirut-explosion-remarks,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,e47803c6906195eb304140db78d45e4ef02745e8f86ffd136fd8adc572fa8fe1,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

According to reports by the BBC and the Globe and Mail, Merdan Ghappar, a successful model on the e-commerce platform Taobao, was detained after having spent over a year in prison on a drugs charge his supporters said was trumped up.  In January, the 31-year-old Uighur was taken back to Xinjiang by police where he was hooded, shackled and held in a crowded police cell with 50-60 prisoners.  Videos and text messages reportedly sent by Ghappar provide a detailed account of his detention and the shocking conditions he says he witnessed, including teenage boys being hooded and beaten, and of the widespread use of âfour-piece suitsâ â combined restraints that are criticised by human rights groups.  Ghappar has not been heard from since March.  Other text messages revealed how children as young as 13 are targeted as part of Chinaâs efforts to suppress the Muslim minority groupâs religion and culture, with a document calling on children to ârepent and surrenderâ.  âA third of the room was taken up by chairs for the duty cops. The rest was men on the right, women on the left, divided up and locked in cages,â Ghappar wrote of the police cell in his texts, which were translated by James Millward, a professor of history at Georgetown University in Washington DC.  âAnd from head to toe, they were all wearing four-piece suits. This so-called four-piece suit was a black cloth bag over the head; handcuffs; shackles; and a steel chain between the handcuffs and the shackles.â  The Globe and Mail (@globeandmail) Inside a Uyghurâs âquarantineâ room: Video shows shackles, filthy conditions and propaganda https://t.co/9qitTHeqdY  In his texts, Ghappar described being made to wear the âfour-piece suitâ, being threatened, and held in unsanitary, and dangerous conditions, with prisoners besieged by lice and sharing unwashed eating utensils to consume âthe leftovers after the cops had eaten, made into rice soupâ.  Moved to an isolated cell for several days, Ghappar said he could hear the screams of people being interrogated nearby.  âOne time I heard a man screaming from morning until evening. This was psychological torture to me â I was afraid, would the next one be me?â  Other prisoners were taken away on minibuses and Ghappar, suffering a cold, was taken to hospital, and then to an isolated room in a neighbouring compound where his belongings were returned to him, including by mistake his phone, which he used to contact his relatives.  A video, which Ghappar sent to family in Europe, shows his hand handcuffed to a thin bed in a small and empty room, while propaganda announcements play in the background over a speaker system.  The BBC said his messages continued for a few days before ceasing about five months ago, and that authorities had provided no formal information about his location or the reason for his detention.  His uncle, Abdulhakim Ghappar, told the BBC he believed Ghappar was detained because he had family outside China who are politically active. âHe was detained just because I am abroad and I take part in protests against Chinese human rights abuses,â he said.

The bill to reform the stateâs children and adolescentsâ rights law proposed fines and the possible closure of stores for selling soft drinks and sweets to children. It in effect puts sugary items into the same category as cigarettes and alcohol.  âItâs important to finally put the brakes on this industry, which has already sickened our country and our children,â said Magaly LÃ³pez DomÃ­nguez, the Oaxaca lawmaker who presented the bill. â[The industry] gets into the most remote corners of the stateâ â known for its mountainous topography â âwhere thereâs often not even medicines, but thereâs Coca-Cola.â  LÃ³pez DomÃ­nguez presented her bill more than a year ago, but said the Covid-19 pandemic had given lawmakers an extra push to limit soda sales.  âThis health emergency makes it even more evident the damage caused by the consumption of these sugary drinks,â LÃ³pez Dominguez said. âIts approval was timely.â  How one of the most obese countries on earth took on the soda giants Read more  The Oaxaca bill comes as Mexico struggles to slow the spread of Covid-19 and public officials pin their pandemic problems on Mexicansâ unhealthy habits â starting with soft drink consumption.  Coronavirus tsar Hugo LÃ³pez-Gatell has branded soft drinks âbottled poisonâ and blamed their consumption for causing 40,000 deaths, along with high incidence of diabetes, obesity and hypertension â all Covid-19 comorbidities.  Mexicoâs drinks industry â a powerful lobby and big advertiser â accused LÃ³pez-Gatell of âsatanising a strategic economic activity and a product that is the preference of millions of Mexicansâ. It said in a statement that government statistics showed Mexicans consumed only 5.8% of their daily calories from soft drinks.  Some critics and public health experts accused LÃ³pez-Gatell â who has equivocated on recommending mask use and pursued a policy of not testing or contact tracing â of searching for a villain as the countryâs virus figures showed few signs of improving. Mexico has registered more than 49,698 Covid-19 fatalities, recently passing the UK as the third-worst country for deaths.  âOur health authorities have not made mask use obligatory and refused widespread testing to detect, trace and contain contagions. Instead Dr LÃ³pez-Gatell has decided to adopt a new strategy: finding scapegoats,â Xavier Tello, a doctor and healthcare consultant, wrote in the newspaper Reforma.  No one denies the grip Mexicoâs drinks industry has on the country. Mexicans drink 163 litres of soft drink a year per head â the most in the world â and consumption starts young. A survey by El Poder del Consumidor â a consumer advocacy group and drinks industry critic â found 70% of schoolchildren in a poor region of Guerrero state reported having soda for breakfast.  Some 73% of the population in Mexico is considered overweight, and related diseases such as diabetes are rife.  âWhen you go to these communities, what you find is junk food. Thereâs no access to clean drinking water,â said Alejandro Calvillo, director of El Poder del Consumidor.  Mexico approved a sugar tax of 1 peso per litre (roughly five US cents) in 2014 and studies found it diminished consumption by 7.5%, according to researchers. But money raised by the tax has not gone toward public health as promised, Calvillo said.",https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/06/mexico-oaxaca-sugary-drinks-junk-food-ban-children,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,edb29a22d3684cb8752db233cf99251429d063d1af574b2dc589929b0a9796da,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The likes of Sia and Pharrell have deftly glided from backroom hitmakers to pop behemoths. Others, such as Keri Hilson and Julia Michaels, have struggled to find their footing in the upper echelons of the charts where their songwriting credits so often appear, instead forging fruitful careers as pop underdogs. Nine years into his career as a solo artist, the UKâs MNEK finally scored his first No 1 last week.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest The artwork for Jaguar.  This is the precipice on which Victoria MonÃ©t finds herself. Despite releasing a number of EPs since 2014, the 27-year-old is best known for her writing credits, specifically her seven-year collaborative relationship with Ariana Grande. Their work together on the latterâs Thank U, Next album netted them Grammy nominations and gave Grande her only two solo US No 1 singles to date. As Sia did with Rihanna, MonÃ©tâs distinct melodic phrasing helped to shape Grandeâs instantly identifiable, skittish cadence.  For her next move, MonÃ©t could have easily made a naked bid for the big leagues. But her latest project (sheâs avoiding the term âalbumâ), Jaguar, is something of a side step. Unlike the wide sonic berth of her previous EPs, which left her struggling to break through the stripped-back R&B, dancehall rhythms and beats reminiscent of Timbalandâs heyday, Jaguar is as sleek and refined as its namesake, the production luscious with live instrumentation and brass. By eschewing popâs current see-what-sticks approach, MonÃ©t can build a luxury brand of her own design.  She demonstrates her self-assurance by lacing Jaguarâs poppier moments with striking idiosyncrasies. After a languid intro of stacked, reverb-laden vocal harmonies, the title track slides into a chugging groove punctuated with jubilant horns a la Bruno Mars. Experience, clearly indebted to Off the Wall-era Quincy Jones, finds MonÃ©t brushing up against 2020âs appetite for disco nostalgia. But amid the plush retro production of SG Lewis, who also aided fellow sequinned revivalist Dua Lipa on her latest album, MonÃ©t and guest vocalist Khalid find their voices smothered with a cosmic, phasing filter that blurs their sound until they become almost indistinguishable from the production â a bold, beautiful choice. Punchy immediacy is key to success on streaming and social media platforms, but MonÃ©t refreshingly gives each song space to breathe.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Victoria MonÃ©t: Experience ft Khalid and SG Lewis  Similarly, she declines to soften her lyrics. âLife is but a dream / Here we are inside of it and youâre inside of me,â she sings on the hazy, X-rated bedroom R&B of Moment, before suggesting that her partner âland it like a plane on my back if you canât hold itâ. Oral sex is paradisiacal on Dive, which cascades like a waterfall. âI just wanna see what your head game like,â she purrs over a chorus of squeaking bed springs and orgasmic groaning, directing her lover to: âLick the beach / Fuck the shore / Make me scream / All aboard.â The practicalities of getting sand in delicate areas notwithstanding, MonÃ©t makes what could be cringeworthy sound genuinely sumptuous.  Victoria MonÃ©t: the Ariana Grande songwriter making bed-quaking R&B Read more  And more often than not, the hyper-sexualisation is pointedly fun: Touch Me, a mix of Janet Jackson-style confessional and SZA slow jam, winks at queer women (âGirl itâs been too long / And when you rock them short nails thatâs lowkey sentimental / No keep âem cut though so there ainât no incidentalsâ). On the sultry Ass Like That, she sends up the fetishisation of black womenâs bodies by giving herself full autonomy over her own.

His theme was the death of one his predecessors as archbishop, St Alphege, hacked to death by the Danes in the early 11th century â the only martyr in the role so far. âThere will soon be another,â Becket declared. Four days later, a quartet of knights arrived drunk, on a perceived mission from the king, and dashed the archbishopâs brains across the cathedral floor. It is easy to see how, knowing his time was up, Becket might identify with Alphege. In The Book in the Cathedral, however, Christopher de Hamel argues that the two had something more tangible in common: an elaborately jewelled psalter â a book of psalms â once owned by Alphege and later treasured by Becket.  The cult that sprang up around Becket after his death spread widely and swiftly. Within three years he was Saint Thomas, and Canterbury would become one of the most visited pilgrimage sites in Europe. When the Reformation came, however, Becket fell out of favour, his relics â bones, clothes, a soiled handkerchief â destroyed as the baggage of an old form of superstition. One curious quirk of relic veneration is that books rarely make the cut. Becketâs library then, shelved unassumingly in a passageway in the cathedral, was spared the reformersâ zeal. Instead it was cherrypicked by Matthew Parker, archbishop to Elizabeth I, who in turn left his own library to his former college at Cambridge.  Illustration of the murder of Thomas Becket. Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images  This is where De Hamelâs intervention begins. In the Parker Library at Corpus Christi college is a psalter dating from the late Anglo-Saxon period. On the final page, a 16th-century inscription â deemed spurious by previous scholars â links the book to two archbishops: Becket and âNâ. The Book in the Cathedral is an exercise in bibliographic detective work, identifying âNâ and overturning the judgment of earlier cataloguers. De Hamel â author of the wonderful Meetings With Remarkable Manuscripts â shows us all the tools of the bibliographerâs trade: dating handwriting, identifying pigments, noting the rust marks left by nails from a now-lost ornate binding. This is done with a lightness that belies De Hamelâs pre-eminence as a manuscript scholar â the telling is brisk, with a light foxing of anecdote, even as the evidence is rigorously lined up.  Hearing of the knightsâ arrival, Becket attended to the stagecraft of his martyrdom, collecting his cloak, his surplice, his ring of office, before going to meet his assailants. Whether his treasured psalter, a material connection to Alphege, was among this symbolic paraphernalia is unknowable now, but De Hamel offers it as a tantalising possibility. This year marks the 850th anniversary of Becketâs murder. The identification â or rehabilitation â of his psalter, the book he carried with him into exile, possibly held at his death, is a timely and enjoyable tribute.  â¢ The Book in the Cathedral: The Last Relic of Thomas Becket is published by Allen Lane (Â£9.99).

2020-08-06 13:15:39.188035,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 07:00:02 GMT",Star Trek: Lower Decks review â breezy yet forgettable animated spin-off,"Despite being set in the same universe as Gene Roddenberryâs landmark series and its myriad film and television offshoots, Star Trek: Lower Decks, an innocuous new animated series about a crew of up-and-coming Starfleet crew members, never leans on its own mythology. The lead characters are young goofballs who work on the crew of the USS Cerritos, a ship specializing in âsecond contactâ, which means they visit new planets after the A-team has already done the more prestigious work. Their jobs are routine and bureaucratic. They usually involve paperwork. None of the characters resemble Captain Kirk or Mr Spock, mentioned here only in passing and usually as the butt of a joke. Instead, Lower Decks smartly creates new, original characters who are funny, relatable, and fully independent of their source material. If Star Trek werenât in the title, you might not even notice the similarities.  Itâs also radically non-serialized, with each episode representing its own comic adventure for our bumbling protagonists. There is Boimler (voiced by Jack Quaid), a rule-following aspiring captain; Mariner (Tawny Newsome), his rebellious co-worker who specializes in making more trouble than Boimler can clean up; Rutherford (Eugene Cordero), an engineer with a new cyborg implant heâs struggling to adjust to; and Tendi (NoÃ«l Wells), the crewâs newest recruit, who is all bubbly enthusiasm. There are also various captains and commanders, and each episode features a smaller assembled crew piloting down to a new planet, getting into trouble with a new race of aliens, and making it back to their spaceship having learned a lesson about teamwork.  Or something. Lower Decks is a little too breezy for its own good, and it moves so quickly through its various plots â each episode feels like it was fastidiously edited to remove any dead air â that it leaves no lasting impression. In the seasonâs first episode, Boimler has been tasked by his superiors with keeping tabs on Mariner. He discovers her selling what he thinks are weapons to some local aliens and disrupts the sale, but it turns out the weapons were only farming equipment, and Boimlerâs mistake offends a local monster, putting the duo in peril. It all happens so fast. The characters are endangered and back on their ship in about two minutes, which hardly leaves the viewer any time to get involved.  Thereâs something admirable about how fiercely committed Lower Decks is to being low-stakes entertainment, which is difficult to achieve in an era in which there is pressure on all creators to be political. Try as we might, no critic will be able to find a hidden agenda here. âAll they care about is glory,â Mariner muses about their superiors, which is the closest Lower Decks ever comes to critiquing the powerful. Itâs a significant change from Roddenberryâs original series, which had its feet firmly planted in the civil rights era. It promoted racial diversity and multiculturalism in both its casting and its themes. Even the latest Star Trek movie featured a hint â OK, one shot â of a gay romance. Lower Decks could be seen as continuing that legacy by casting Newsome, a black woman, as one of its leads, but its interest in identity politics, or any other kind, stops there.  The problem is itâs not really interested in anything. Itâs a comedy show without gags or setpieces. The voice actors â most of whom are members of the Upright Citizens Brigade comedy improv family â do their best to imbue the dialogue with real comic timing. Recalling her encounter with ârectal insectoidsâ, Mariner jokes: âI got chewed out, but his ass got chewed up!â Itâs not quite a joke, but Newsome sells it so hard youâll end up laughing regardless. Less effective are the occasional self-referential quips, as when one character finds themselves accosted by tribal warriors. âAh, circled by spears, this is a classic,â Mariner says. âWhat am I, Kirk?â Itâs a kitchen-sink approach by the writers, trying every style they can muster without landing on any actual comedy.  The disappointments of Lower Decks are particularly frustrating because, in theory, this is exactly the kind of approach to intellectual property that we need. For years now, critics and fans have fantasized about a studio or network taking a real chance with a franchise. A real neo-noir Batman, or a romantic comedy starring Black Widow and the Hulk. Instead, we get a repetitive cycle of origin stories. But here at long last is a series that is willing to cast the old myths aside and explore a hidden corner of its world. It could have been the start of something great, if that hadnât been the last risk this particular series ever took.",https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/06/star-trek-lower-decks-review-animated,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,340908e05fdef318763bb18d75bcd8533d36eda4dc1ac0976cd8157f7366df8f,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:15:39.553101,"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 14:06:08 GMT","The teacher, the baker and the snack-box maker: meet the small firms going online for the first time","Despite never selling online in the 10 years since he cofounded his artisan bakery Bread Source, Steven Winter was left with little choice when the coronavirus lockdown was announced in March. As restaurants closed, the wholesale arm of the business disappeared, and he had no idea what was going to happen to his four shops or his market stalls across Norwich and Aylsham. âAt that point there was no furlough scheme. All I was trying to do was pay my 30 staff,â Winter says.  The response to the new website, which launched at the start of April, blew him away. âIn the first week or two, we were up to 200 orders a day,â he says. âWe sold 10,000 loaves, 25,000 pastries and 10 tonnes of flour online over two months.â The team expanded their range to include other staples such as eggs, milk, butter and coffee, which were dropped off to customers across Norfolk using the bakeryâs two delivery vans.  Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze, has been paired with Steven Winter.  Winter was also mindful of making good food available to his hospitality colleagues, many of whom had lost their jobs. He introduced a National Loaf scheme, inspired by a product conceived by the Federation of Bakers in 1942 to keep the country fed during the second world war. Today, Winter is selling the nutritious loaf for Â£1 and he is now hoping to expand the initiative nationwide.  The Bread Source is not alone in exploring online channels for the first time. Research by the Federation of Small Businesses has found that 16% of SMEs developed a new website or increased their online presence because of lockdown. A GoDaddy survey also found that one in five microbusinesses (those with fewer than nine employees) have set up online for the first time in the past three months, and almost all (82%) say they will maintain their digital presence in the future.  Sakshi Anand, senior director for GoDaddy UK, says Covid-19 has provided many small businesses with the impetus to get online, driving whatâs becoming known as a second digital revolution: âOne of the biggest barriers is people think itâs really complicatedâ, she says about launching a website. âMost microbusiness owners run finance, the technology and marketing, theyâre doing everything. But once you start seeing sales coming or you see other businesses who are thriving from it, you realise itâs something you definitely need. And with GoDaddyâs drag-and-drop marketing tools, you can have a fully functioning website online in 24-48 hours.â  For Winter, itâs been transformational â the online demand covered the sales the bakery would have made if it had been business as usual. Heâs keen to make the businessâs digital channel a permanent feature, and will be using this opportunity to develop an email marketing campaign for the 5,000 customers on the bakeryâs database, experiment with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, and explore widening its audience beyond the local market. Heâll be supported by Rosie Mills-Smith, Bread Sourceâs marketing lead, GoDaddy Guides â a 6,000-strong team providing bespoke support to small business owners â and a suite of digital tools. He and Mills-Smith are mindful of the need to scale their new retail channel in a sustainable way. âI think probably the hardest thing has been going from dealing with three or four enquiries a day on social media and via email, to literally thousands more,â says Mills-Smith.  In Bath, yoga and meditation teacher Lucy Stone has been inspired to launch her new website because of the popularity of her free guided meditation videos, posted on Facebook during the pandemic. âWhen I started there were 10 or 15 people and then each video was getting 1,000 views. It was amazing,â she says.  Meditation Rocks is the third business for Stone, who also runs Yogadoo, providing yoga classes for children at school, and The Hive yoga studio. Although the yoga studio has been offering classes online during lockdown, it was the demand for meditation guidance that skyrocketed and made Stone realise she should launch her own separate offering. âThey were massively outperforming yoga, by around 400%,â she says. âAnd it was mostly people trying meditation for the first time â¦ seeking out ways to look after themselves.â  Nadia Narain is Lucy Stoneâs mentor  Sheâll now work with GoDaddyâs Guides to design and launch a dedicated website for Meditation Rocks. She plans to provide guided meditation for children and adults via free videos, and to offer more in-depth courses, for which sheâll charge. Sheâs also open to the idea of launching a blog and adding an online shop to sell merchandise.  One of the challenges she knows sheâll face in growing her brand is attracting new customers, and dealing with the image of meditation. âYoga has come a long way in the past 15 years or so, itâs become very cool,â she says. âMeditation is still playing catch up â¦ thereâs a lot of misunderstanding about what it is and what it does.â  But she wonât be alone as she makes plans for Meditation Rocks. To help Stone and, indeed, Steven Winter at Bread Source to nail their digital futures, weâve paired each of them with a mentor who can offer expert advice.  Stone will be supported by yoga and meditation teacher Nadia Narain. With a client list that has included Rachel Weisz, Kate Moss, Jools Oliver, and the Arsenal football team, Narain has been teaching yoga since 1996. She was one of Triyogaâs original teachers when the studio opened in London in 2000. She is also an author, has a range of DVDs, developed her own perfume and aromatherapy candles, and recently launched an online course promoting self care during lockdown, with her sister Katia.  âI always think of yoga as my love,â says Narain. âAnd Iâm so lucky that I get to do it.â She enjoys mentoring other teachers and says monetisation is something a lot of people ask her about.  âThe thing I feel I do the best with teachers is to bring out their voice. That authenticity is super important. All you can do is bring the deepest, most authentic part of yourself [to class] and let that shine through.â  The mentor paired with Winter is Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze. He has led the healthy-snacks company for the past seven years, as it expanded into markets such as the US, Ireland and the Netherlands, and into UK retail outlets including Boots, WH Smith and Waitrose.  Today it has a 200,000-strong subscriber base, and a product range of 400 different snack combinations. Fletcher believes itâs the ideal time for small, local businesses to make an impact online, even if theyâre working with limited budgets. âWhen Graze started [in 2008] it cost big bucks to do what we did. But a lot of that cost has gone away. You can now do quite sophisticated things very cheaply and without a lot of technical knowledge.  âThe wonderful thing about digital is itâs intuitive,â he adds. âSo go and spend Â£20 on marketing. If it works well, spend Â£40 the next day. If nothing resonates, maybe you change things around and try something a bit different ... The obvious advantage that small businesses have is agility, and the ability to set off in a new direction. But I think weâve crossed the Rubicon with Covid-19. People want to buy local, people want to know whoâs behind the business. Theyâll back you if they buy into who you are and what youâre trying to do.â  Anand agrees, citing GoDaddy research that found 63% of customers say theyâre more likely to shop at small local businesses during the pandemic, and 67% of those intend to continue doing so in the future. âMore now than ever, people have realised the importance of supporting small businesses,â she says. âThat community spirit has really shone through this crisis.â  GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

Photograph: visualspace/Getty Images  Starting a business and planning for its future once involved bricks and mortar, shelves, tills and customers walking through your door. Not so today. Even before the coronavirus lockdown limited peopleâs trips to retailers in the flesh, online shopping was flying high. According to the Global Ecommerce Market Ranking 2019, the UK has the worldâs fourth largest e-commerce market in revenue terms, and the third highest percentage of online shoppers, at almost 80%. And itâs set to continue. Research by the analysts Retail Economics last year found that 53% of retail sales were expected to be online by 2028. In the wake of lockdown, it seems likely this trend will only accelerate.  From promotions to gift cards: how a great website keeps customers coming back again and again Read more  Given the way that we shop is changing, it has never been more important for retailers to get online. In a survey for the website builder GoDaddy, a fifth of micro businesses said they had gone online for the first time during lockdown and nearly half that their use of digital and social media tools had increased.  For some, e-commerce has always been part of the plan. The artisan hot chocolate company Knoops opened its first store in Rye, East Sussex, in 2013, and went on to open a London store in February this year, with more planned. But head of marketing Anna Chapman says that having an online presence was always a key part of the companyâs strategy. âChocolate has a broad appeal, and we wanted to be able to reach people in their homes, especially those who didnât live near our stores,â she says.  The companyâs website centres around its hot chocolate maker, the Knoopifier, with owners getting access to online subscriptions for pouches of âKnoopifierâ chocolate buttons delivered to their home. The website has always been an important part of the companyâs strategy, but Chapman says that lockdown emphasised this further.  âWhile our doors were closed, it was obviously the only way we could take any revenue at all, and we were able to focus our efforts entirely on our website and social media channels,â she says. âThis importance will remain â the majority of retailers now accept that an omnichannel approach is vital. Our current situation has been an extremely stark reminder of its importance.â  For other SMEs, while a website may have been part of their business, using it to sell is a recent addition. Rob Wilson, âchief toasterâ at Toast Ale, a craft beer brewer that uses bread which would otherwise be wasted, says that despite having an online presence, it wasnât really part of the businessâs strategy.  âWe very much focused on building our brand online but our routes to market were bars, pubs, restaurants and retail â 70% of our business was on-trade, about 30% was in conventional retail environments, and a fraction of a percent was online,â he says.  But when those sales channels were cut off during lockdown, Toast Ale, which donates its profits to sustainability charities, was forced to shift its sales online. âWe started to rebuild our website and have far more focus on a more functional online shop. It has massively transformed our business and helped us survive â itâs become a huge opportunity to reach a whole new audience. We just hadnât thought about it as a sales channel and now weâve suddenly realised its potential.â  Similarly, Chris Fryer, founder of the vegan pie business Magpye, hadnât really explored e-commerce, instead selling pies from his converted horse box at events and supplying local pubs in the north of England. âWe had a full calendar of events booked. We were supplying pubs with pies and had just expanded, dropping off to four or five pubs twice a week. Then our income stopped â it was a cliff-edge.â  Like Wilson at Toast Ale, Fryer realised quickly that he would have to shift to e-commerce and has been similarly amazed by the effect it has had.  âAt the moment weâre just doing local deliveries across the north east but weâre looking into expanding. Our plan potentially is to sell our horsebox and become a web-based pie shop,â he says.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Online tools - such as those offered by GoDaddy - make it easy to create a web store and process orders. Photograph: svetikd/Getty Images  When it comes to setting up an e-commerce site, there is an increasingly wide range of tools available to business owners from a range of sources. They include web hosting companies such as GoDaddy, which has created Open We Stand â a portal of resources for small businesses during lockdown. Fryer says that while he has some experience building websites, it was quicker and easier to turn to readymade tools with GoDaddy.  âI had the domain registered with GoDaddy but had done nothing with it. Once it became clear we would have to move online I started looking into it. I could have gone down the route of coding it from scratch but it would have taken a week or two, especially things like payment options. With the GoDaddy tools it took half a day, then I spent a day or two testing and it was ready to go. Although we didnât use the option, I knew GoDaddy would build the site for you for free if you needed,â he says.  âThey do a free three-month trial, so thereâs really nothing to lose by having a go. The admin side, monitoring it, doing the orders is all quite simple, so even if youâve got no skills whatsoever I donât think many people would struggle with it.â  At Toast Ale, the switch was led by COO Louisa Ziane, who has experience of managing websites. Wilson is adamant that the work has paid off, with e-commerce proving an âamazing opportunityâ, not just now but, he believes, in the future. âI would say that at current rates weâre looking at probably half a million pounds of revenue coming from our online shop. Last year as a business we took around Â£1m in total, so that shows that it is very quickly becoming a significant part of our business.â  GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

Photograph: Trinette Reed Photography/Stocksy United  Picture the scene. Youâre keen to find out more about a product so you google it, and the search results bring up various mentions â¦ but there doesnât seem to be any online links to the company that produces it. After a few more tries, you give up with a shrug.  The fact is that without a website, a business doesnât exist â or, as Descartes might have it: âI link therefore I am.â Itâs a concept that Stuart Prescott, the co-founder of a freeze-dried fruit brand, 5th Season, understands implicitly: âItâs expected that a business should have a website; if they didnât, you might not trust them,â he says.  With a background in product development and marketing for the likes of Pepsi and Kettle Chips, Prescott knows what it takes to make a successful brand. âIf you look at the small businesses that have got big â Graze, Huel, Grenade â they were online-only for a number of years,â he says. âWhat that meant is that they had a really great relationship with their consumers, so as soon as they went into Tesco, for example, or another retailer, they were a huge success.â  Launching your business online also allows you to test and learn more affordably than if you were to open a bricks-and-mortar store. âThe plan was always to set up online initially,â says Andy Walker, who launched Gingerbread Bakery in February, just as pandemic preparations were ramping up. Featuring personalised notes and packaging, Walkerâs brownies and other baked goods make handy long-distance gifts, so the timing has actually panned out OK. (Not that you can please everybody: âSomeone did complain to me yesterday about being called Gingerbread Bakery even though we donât sell any gingerbread yet,â he says.) Customers enter their message directly on to the website and Walker fires up the oven to order.  An IT software developer by trade, Walker resisted the temptation to personally engineer every facet of his site. âI know how much work generally goes into e-commerce so I knew it could be a long-winded process, and thatâs why I started to look at off-the-shelf solutions. I donât want to be writing code. I could â I could spend eight or nine hours a day developing my own website â but thatâs not what I wanted to do, I wanted to bake brownies.â  Unlike 5th Season, which brought in an external company to create its website, Walker researched the self-build options and decided to go for GoDaddy.  âIt just seemed the most logical to me. It could do everything that I needed without it being too technical. This was âclick and doâ,â he says.  By using GoDaddyâs Websites + Marketing, which has been made free during the Covid-19 pandemic, Walker benefits from a whole suite of tools, including search engine optimisation (SEO), email marketing, blog analytics and social media stats. This keeps him incredibly close to his business performance, whether heâs seeking to identify best-sellers or regular customers.  So far, so successful â but what if youâre selling a service, not a product? And what if that service is all about bringing people together, at a time when no one could leave their house? As the country closed in on itself in March, Lizzy Eaton, the founder of an events agency, Oddity Events, began sharing virtual hints and tips via her business blog. This grew into a series of weekly webinars and, to her surprise, created new business leads too.  âI didnât think I would be selling any of my services during this time, but because of my blog and my website I have been able to,â says Eaton. Off the back of her online marketing â which, like Walker, she runs through GoDaddy Websites + Marketing â she was approached by a brand consultancy firm who wanted to run a virtual event.  âBeing online has helped us surviveâ: how e-commerce can kickstart your small business in lockdown â and beyond Read more  For Eaton, digital will remain a core part of her business even as restrictions are lifted. âYou can integrate online to make your events more sustainable by, for example, not flying in speakers from across the world, or you can have all of your assets on a website rather than printing out reams of paper,â she says.  âEven in normal times, I speak a lot to clients about how we can make our events more inclusive,â she says. âI talk about it in terms of physical inclusion for people with disabilities, and cultural inclusion. For me, the digital aspect of events and event design is actually more inclusive than some physical events.â  Eaton says she is currently writing a proposal for a project in 2022 and sheâs already thinking of ways to make it âa hybrid eventâ with both physical and digital elements.  So, what would these entrepreneurs say to small business owners who havenât got a website yet? Eaton, who sees her website as the shopfront for her events business, is emphatic: âJust go for it and donât be scared, because the beauty of online is that you can change things.â  Walker at Gingerbread Bakery plans to do just that, firstly by growing his online customer base and perhaps following up with a shop or cafe one day, too. And who knows, by then he may even sell gingerbread.

Photograph: Maskot/Getty Images  Most businesses these days will have some form of social media presence, but many may not be making the most of the opportunities it provides. Not only does it open up a huge potential customer base â half the worldâs population is now on social media â it also gives companies the perfect opportunity to build and retain loyalty among existing customers.  Like all aspects of technology, social media is constantly evolving. So while a small business may have set up a Facebook or a Twitter account a few years back and thought that was a case of âjob doneâ, new social media platforms such as TiKTok have been developed since then, while Instagram and YouTube have become vital parts of a holistic social media ecosystem.  Beyond the platforms themselves, trends have also changed in terms of what users want, how they interact with brands and whatâs important to them. Customers have now become fans, emotional ties to brands are a thing and thought-leadership can make you an influencer. Content is still king, and shareability is vital.  But as well as all this modern stuff â the basics are still important too.  âOn the high street you wouldnât have a shopfront with a broken window, peeling paint, rubbish everywhere and goods randomly thrown on displays, and expect to thrive,â says PR and social media expert Mike Crutchley.  As someone who helps businesses improve and overhaul their social media strategies, he says first impressions count.  âSocial media channels must be up to date with everything from posts to contact details and opening hours,â he says. âHigh-quality images and videos, as well as good grammar and spelling are as vital as creating engaging posts.â  The tools that allow businesses to make this happen have never been more accessible, and there is now an opportunity to try some of them out free of charge. Customers of the website builder GoDaddy are currently receiving a complimentary 90-day premium subscription to the mobile app Over, which gives them access to simple templates for creating sleek and effective social media content.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest High quality images and video are vital on social media. Photograph: Stocksy United  Shareability matters  Sometimes the things that work best on social media are the simplest. You can have all the metrics and dashboards in the world, but if people donât engage and share your original posts then youâre missing a huge potential source of customers.  When Dutch-born Londoner Annemarie Plas saw people in countries throughout Europe clapping for their healthcare workers she was inspired to help set up something similar in her adopted home, and so created clapforourcarers.co.uk with GoDaddy.  Scaling up quickly could well have proved a challenge, but with the astute use of social media things have gone from strength to strength.  âI just put together a small image and posted it on my socials such as Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, and sent it to all my UK friends by WhatsApp, I also made a small website and an Insta page,â says Plas.  Freeze-dried fruit and brownies: how having a website kept these businesses thriving when lockdown hit Read more  Her efforts to spread the word were given a huge boost when her campaign was picked up by influencers such as the Beckhams and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, who shared it to their followers.  The first clap happened on Thursday 26 March at 8pm and became a weekly event, being covered by the national media and circulated widely on social media too, right up to the final clap on 28 May.  Although Plas has a background working for media agencies, she had neither the time nor staff support that other organisations might be able to draw upon. So she decided to keep things simple and made shareability a big part of her strategy.  âI understood the importance of having simple and engaging messaging. I used a hashtag and made the image easy to share on any social channels.â  Her simple and consistent messaging has resulted in the #clapforourcarers hashtag being shared more than 139,000 times on Instagram alone.  Becoming an influencer  âSome influencers get a bad reputation,â says Masha Zvereva, founder of Coding Blonde. She set up her blog back in 2015, when she was trying to learn some coding skills to make her more employable. She originally registered it with GoDaddy, which she then also used as a hosting provider.  Through that blog, as well as Instagram and YouTube, Zvereva has amassed a loyal following and is now regarded as an influencer in the field of women in tech, entrepreneurship and personal growth.  âInfluencers can be perceived as fake, superficial, salesy etc, but what people donât see is the hard work that goes behind being able to make a living off of this business model and growing your business,â she says.  Quality content is paramount according to Zvereva. Whether youâre filming a video for YouTube or writing a thought leadership piece, it has to add value beyond simply advertising your skills to the wider world.  âAnyone can become an influencer if they want to, but Iâd recommend approaching it from the standpoint of adding value to an audience,â she says.  âWhatâs the purpose behind your blog? How will you be impacting peopleâs lives and who is your target audience? And finally, why should it be you?â  Building a brand  Many people might still associate social media in a business context purely with selling, but its importance when it comes to building a brand canât be overstated.  This is something Zaffrin and Brian OâSullivan, co-founders of the vegan skincare company Five Dot Botanics set out to do well before their company launched.  Establishing it on Instagram even before they had products to sell, they were able to develop a loyal audience.  âSocial media has allowed small brands like mine to build a brand. Historically it would not have been possible to launch a beauty brand without millions of pounds to acquire customers through marketing,â says Zaffrin.  Before setting up those social channels though, their first move was to register a domain name and get a URL through GoDaddy. Then it was time to get the ball rolling with social media.  The stories the OâSullivans shared werenât all about success, but about the challenges they were facing. This honesty helped create a situation where people were rooting for them. The couple were also able to get 600 people signed up to their newsletter email list so there was already an eager customer base waiting for when the products were ready.  Once the social channels were up and running, the OâSullivans set up an internet landing page using GoDaddyâs services â and they were in business.  Social continues to be at the heart of their marketing. As well as using Instagram for brand-building, Zaffrin posts to Pinterest and Facebook, although she says the latter works best for business if youâre willing to put money behind it â paying for targeted ads, for example. Otherwise the other platforms can be effective without budget, simply by skilful use. Zaffrin uses LinkedIn to raise her business profile and publish articles, and is curious about TikTok, saying it is âone to watchâ.  âOur audience are our fans,â she says. âThey root for our success, and our customers on social tell us every day what they think and what they want. We are constantly listening to them, whether theyâre letting us know how they are using our products or coming up with ideas for new ones.â  GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

2020-08-06 13:15:40.389251,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 08:00:03 GMT",The Argos catalogue: why Britain's love affair with The Book of Dreams had to end,"How much do people in England love Argos? The answer comes from a surprising source: information concerning the riots that swept the country in the summer of 2011. When rioters fancied chucking a brick through a shop window and seeing what they could walk out with, Argosâs premises were the most commonly targeted. More people wanted to steal stuff from Argos than anywhere else.  That is not something about which Argos boasts â most-looted shop in England, 2011! â but it is a measure of how British people perceive Argos: the place that has everything (even if, in reality, the shops have only things that will sell immediately, or stuff that has been ordered for collection by customers). Why do we think Argos has everything? Because of its catalogue, âThe Book of Dreamsâ.  Last week, though, Argos announced the dream was over: after almost 50 years and 93 editions, totalling more than 1bn copies, the catalogue is to cease publication. Although there will still be a Christmas gift guide, it is the end for the printed edition â which had swelled to nearly 2,000 pages in its later years. From now on, you will need to go online, or browse on the in-store screens. No more lying on the sofa with a pen, a catalogue and a precariously balanced cup of tea.  People remember as children circling the toys they wanted in the catalogue. Photograph: Michael Hay/retromash.com  The grief was immediate and real. âSo farewell then, Laminated Book of Dreams, Wipe-Clean Almanac of Aspirations, Sanitised Lexicon of Possibility,â tweeted the comedian Bill Bailey. âI, like so many others, will briefly mourn your passing before instantly kowtowing to our new Touch-Screen Overlords.â The rapper Slowthai â perhaps best known for brandishing a model of Boris Johnsonâs severed head at last yearâs Mercury Prize ceremony â noted: âArgos is gonna stop printing its catalogue. I spent most [of] my childhood circling shit I was never gonna get.â  There is a temptation to view the Proustian rush of the Argos catalogue as a uniquely British phenomenon. That is not so, notes the American writer Robin Cherry, author of Catalog: The Illustrated History of Mail-Order Shopping. âDuring the second world war, they used to send Sears catalogues to injured American soldiers, because it would remind them of their homes,â she says. âAnd the whole âdreamâ idea? Neiman Marcus [in the US] was the first to do that â it started the âhis and hersâ Christmas gifts thing.â She notes that Neiman Marcusâs Christmas catalogue was such a big seasonal event that the broadcaster Ed Murrow â when not trying to end McCarthyism â would produce an annual report on what the department store had anointed as the yearâs must-have present.  Itâs a window back to the past, a time machine â a snapshot of the culture of that particular year  Still, no cult of catalogue collectors exists in the US quite like that of the Argos catalogue collectors in the UK. Currently, there are people on eBay asking Â£20 for the most recent edition, doubtless expecting the stores to have been emptied after Argosâs announcement. Michael Hay, 44, is one such collector, although Argos catalogues are just one element of the cultural ephemera he celebrates on his website, retromash.com. It is the catalogues that people enjoy the most, he says. âWhen people come round my house they always get excited about them,â he says. âAnd they get the most hits on my website.â But he has been surprised to discover the nostalgic hit they deliver is not just a âremember Spangles and white dog poo?â piece of whimsy: he also gets calls from the families of those with Alzheimerâs or dementia, who have found that showing them catalogues helps them link their present with their past. âThat can be very beneficial. Itâs nice to help in that small way.â  Hayâs collection began early in the last decade, when he bought a copy on eBay. âIt snowballed from there. I got some from friends who found them in attics. Iâve been contacted by people who used to work for Argos and had stashes of them and then sent me their collections.â He has every issue bar one (âWhich Iâm hoping to get next weekâ), up to 1994: he is not interested in modern Argos, only in its history. âItâs a window back to the past, a time machine. Itâs not just a random collection of pictures of items â itâs a snapshot of the culture of that particular year,â he says.  âCatalogues are useful tools for looking at society,â says Steve Miles, a professor of sociology at Manchester Metropolitan University, specialising in the sociology of retail. âThey are historical documents from a world that has rapidly changed, and taste is a very important aspect of that. Taste isnât about what you consume or your aesthetic approach; our tastes demonstrate our aspiration to belong to a particular sector of society. We assert our place in society through what we buy, so a catalogue is a way to assert ourselves.â  Flick through old Argos catalogues online and you see precisely what he means. You can trace some of the paths of social change through these pages. Take one catalogue at random and you could construct the set for an entire period drama from it: the 1982/83 edition, for example, celebrates the passage of pine from effete Scandinavian wood to mainstay of the home, with both âpine for the kitchenâ and âpine for the bedroomâ. This being the golden age of the Breville sandwich-maker â when millions of Britons believed the perfect sandwich was toasted, sealed at the sides and containing a filling approximately the temperature of molten gold â you can choose from 12 separate sandwich-makers (though only three child car seats, because children â letâs be frank â matter less than sandwiches).  An Argos catalogue from 1976-7. Photograph: Argos  That edition also featured the first Argos listing for what would eventually destroy the catalogue: the home computer, although not a brand you would be likely to choose for your next laptop: âThe home computer from Texas Instruments â itâs a whole new way to learn.â The following year, TI was still there, but joined by two new computers â the Vic-20 and Mattelâs Aquarius. The real business by 83/84, though, was the new fad of electronic gaming: there are nine pages of listings for electronic games, with 34 more for the old-fashioned stuff: board games, dolls, action figures and the like.  To leaf through an Argos catalogue is a sensory experience, too. Jingles and slogans come flooding back as you see the products: âWeebles wobble but they donât fall downâ, âThe great smell of Brutâ, âBraun Independent â anytime, anywhereâ. The catalogue feels as though it symbolises something more profound than kids circling what they want for Christmas, but what?  âIt was symbolic of a particular period in history when consumption became a key element of how we identified ourselves,â Miles says. The catalogue was a way to forge our identities based on aspiration and with it, âmade the link between choice and freedomâ, he says. The idea was that âthrough its freedom of choice, and through consumption, we could somehow achieve a degree of fulfilment. The end of the catalogue demonstrates we are moving beyond that.â  Implicit in that reading of the Argos catalogue is its class dimension. Argos â with its gold watches, its affordable jewellery, its music centres and DIY pages â was a working-class shop. One could go further: it was the shop that embodied the Thatcherite dream of bringing the working class far enough into the middle class that they need never vote Labour again (not, naturally, that Argos was driving this, merely reflecting it). Although born in the 70s, Argos came of age in the Thatcher years: the company was bought by British American Tobacco in 1979; in 1990, it was demerged and floated on the stock market. It did as its customers did: it bettered itself.  What people aspired to in 1995-6. Photograph: Argos  Although the catalogueâs selling point was price â âBuy it at Argos and pocket the difference,â proclaimed the covers of the early editions â it made sure it did not exclude the middle classes. âIt was hugely democratic, and thatâs a factor in its success,â says Lucie Greene, a brand adviser and cultural forecaster. âIt doesnât have class associations in the same way as John Lewis, which could not be more middle class. Argos is quite universal, and itâs baked into peopleâs collective memory of commerce from quite a young age.â  Argos has also been one of retailâs great innovators. Natalie Berg, founder of the consultancy NBK Retail, moved to the UK from the US 15 years ago and at first was baffled by the Argos catalogue (âI had a hard time getting my head round why someone would want a leopard-print all-in-oneâ), but she frequently uses it to illustrate forward-thinking business practices. âArgos, in my view, was knowingly ahead of its time,â she says. âIt was the analogue version of Amazon and, even today, I think it is one of the few high-street retailers that keeps Amazon on its toes.â She observes that click and collect â now a mainstay of online shopping â was pioneered by Argos; she notes its merging of the physical and digital retail worlds; she says that Argos is usually quicker than Amazon; and she predicts: âMore shops in future will look like Argos â they will have less selling space, and stores will become mini-warehouses to meet demands for anything.â The digital revolution, she says, has made Argos more universal in terms of appeal. âIt could be less of a value retailer, and could instead compete based on convenience â basically Amazon with stores. Thatâs clearly why Sainsbury bought it [in 2016].â  Thereâs another little oddity, though. The big buzz in retail now is making things âexperientialâ, so going shopping is about more than shopping. Retailers want to give you experiences that make you return â demonstrations of skills, pop-up cafes, that sort of thing. I suggest to Berg that the Argos catalogue was actually primitive experiential retailing, in that what people remember is not queuing up to collect the goods, but the hours spent at home picking them: that is what all the mournful tweets dwelt on. Berg isnât so sure, although she says: âI definitely give my kids a catalogue to keep them quiet, and I suppose thatâs tapping into something.â Greene, though, sees the parallels, noting the high-end catalogues that look like coffee-table books and serve not so much as sales tools but as lifestyle porn. They are all experience, no retail â Argos served a not dissimilar function.  What killed the Argos catalogue, almost certainly, was that it was no longer worth the cost of printing against the sales it directly generated. But what made it lose its central place in everyday life was the way social media transformed so many peopleâs sense of self, so the act of consumption became less about having what everyone else has and more about having things no one else has. Miles and Greene both bring up this theme. Greene says: âWe got taught to be consumers in the 50s, to want things and think about trends, but trend has given way to this sense of constant curation, and brands being an expression of your identity and taste. Everyone wants to some degree to be a tastemaker, so you donât want to buy stuff everyone else has.â Miles observes that we are undergoing a shift to sculpting our identities not from the products we display, but âthe things we engage inâ.  The public grief about the end of the The Book of Dreams, then, is not so much about losing the chance to look at carriage clocks, toolkits and electric blankets, but more about mourning how we have changed. (âWhen was the last time you really flicked through an Argos catalogue?â Berg asks. Well, probably not since my kids got more interested in screens than physical objects).  Everything passes, and everyone changes, as even Hay would acknowledge. âWe wallpapered one of our bathrooms with pages from old Argos catalogues,â he says. âBut thatâs going to be redecorated.â Farewell, The Book of Dreams.",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/06/the-argos-catalogue-why-britains-love-affair-with-the-book-of-dreams-had-to-end,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,3ba56391bc6ef8e96492fd303a2c988d9063083064fc3b544fa03a4466ea6dc0,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:15:40.574543,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 09:00:04 GMT",Can loneliness be cured with a pill? Scientists are now asking the question,"Shortly after relocating to Texas from California three years ago, Cheryl Webster started hosting a game night at her home as a way of meeting new people. They stopped meeting due to Covid-19, and Webster has only heard from one person in the group in the months since they were able to play.  Eventually, she decided to pick up the phone herself â but nobody called back.  âI think thatâs the hardest part about loneliness,â she said. âIs it my fault? Am I not a very nice person? Or is there something wrong with me?â  Webster, 65, is a proactive doer who volunteers regularly and has even helped finance the education of several friendsâ children. She sits on the board of the Austin housing authority and the chamber of commerce, and is sure the Christian business leadersâ group she meets with monthly would say flattering things about her. Though divorced and childless, Webster is not a Havisham spinster â putting herself âout thereâ comes naturally. And so she supposes many people in her life would be surprised to learn that sheâs lonely. Despite following the advice of experts to ward off the feeling, her heart still aches.  Webster is not alone. A growing number of people share her affliction â so much so that some governments are incorporating loneliness into their health public policy. To help people like her, a number of scientists are researching medical solutions, such as pills and nasal sprays. But will treating loneliness like a disease, rather than an existential question, work to ease their pain?  â¢ â¢ â¢  There is no standard definition for what, exactly, it means to be lonely. In his book Loneliness, the neuroscientist John Cacioppo described it as a perceived social lack, a âsubjective experienceâ, making the point that one need not be physically isolated to feel painfully lonely (ever been alone in a crowded room?).  Everyone experiences loneliness to varying degrees throughout life, and common circumstances contribute to situational loneliness: the death of a loved one, moving to a new city, being the new kid at school, divorce, loss of mobility or illness.  Chronic loneliness has a different flavor to it. In her book A Biography of Loneliness, the cultural historian Fay Bound Alberti wrote that it has little to do with being alone: âIt is a conscious, cognitive feeling of estrangement or social separation from meaningful others; an emotional lack that concerns a personâs place in the world.â It is harder to define, and harder still to treat, especially the longer the feeling lasts.  In 2014, Cacioppo and his wife and research partner, Stephanie Cacioppo, reported in a journal article that feeling socially isolated can raise levels of the stress hormone cortisol, disrupt sleep, and also lead to long term health consequences, such as earlier morbidity. Julianne Holt-Lunstadâs 2015 study found that loneliness was âmore dangerous than obesityâ.  For individuals like Webster, who says sheâs felt âlike the odd one outâ her entire life, the potential physical health effects of an already emotionally painful experience are a double whammy.  A few years later, in 2017, the former US surgeon general Vivek H Murthy sounded the alarm, deeming loneliness an âepidemicâ. His concerns were supported a few months later by Cignaâs 2018 Loneliness Survey, based on the UCLA Loneliness Scale, a questionnaire which asks respondents to indicate whether each of 20 statements describes how they often, sometimes, rarely or never feel. For instance: âI am unhappy doing so many things alone;â; âthere is no one I can turn toâ; âmy interests and ideas are not shared by othersâ.  The results found that nearly 50% of Americans said they sometimes or always felt alone, and one in four rarely or never felt that others understood them (in the 2020 survey, 61% of Americans report being lonely, an 11% increase in just two years).  Those catchy statistics kicked off a spate of alarmist news articles about loneliness. Soon after, the UK appointed Tracey Crouch as its first minister of loneliness. According to a government press release, by 2023, general practitioners in England âwill be able to refer patients experiencing loneliness to community activities and voluntary servicesâ â prescribing social solutions in much the same way they prescribe medications.  Over the past few years, social interventions such as therapy groups, get-togethers and special benches that invite lonely people to sit down and meet others have proliferated throughout North America and Europe to address the problem.  The solution, however, might not lie in meeting casual acquaintances more often. Science says that it is meaningful relationships that ease loneliness, not a full social calendar. This led some researchers to turn their interest towards medicine: could a pharmaceutical treatment help lonely people form the meaningful relationships they crave?  â¢â¢â¢  Inside the Brain Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Chicago, Stephanie Cacioppo hooks up subjects to electrodes to measure brain activity. Since May 2017, sheâs been conducting clinical trials, seeking the answer to loneliness in pill form.  Pregnenolone, a hormone produced primarily by the adrenal gland, has shown positive signs of reducing levels of anxiety that perpetuate, as the medical world puts it, perceived social isolation. June marked the studyâs estimated completion date.  For years, her husband had been writing about how loneliness can alter the way an individualâs brain works. In his 2008 book he wrote that âloneliness itself is not a diseaseâ, and that situational loneliness would never require âa remedy in the form of a pillâ, but that medications might benefit âindividuals caught in the feedback loop of loneliness and negative affectâ in order âto first bring their depression or anxiety under controlâ. But neither he nor his wife had broached the possibility of fighting perceived social isolation with medicine until a few years later.  John Cacioppo in 2016. He died in 2018; his wife, Stephanie, continues the research they had started together. Photograph: Lucy Hewett/The Observer  In a March 2015 review, they helped introduce the still-controversial notion that short-term pharmacological treatments such as oxytocin, in conjunction with psychotherapy, could help patients.  By December that year, the Cacioppos were focused on treating anxiety and depressive or aggressive behaviors with a version of a naturally-occurring neurosteroid (a steroid formed in the brain) called allopregnanolone. Studies, including some by the Cacioppos, had shown allopregnanolone to reduce anxiety and to promote the regeneration of brain cells, and was being considered as a possible therapy for PTSD, traumatic brain injuries and Alzheimerâs.  It went on the market last year as Zulresso, as a prescribed treatment for postpartum depression at about $34,000 a prescription (because of the secondary effects associated with taking it, the medication is only available through a restricted program.) The Cacioppos found that perceived social isolation, too, was probably associated with an impaired ability to synthesize allopregnanolone â which is how the current clinical trial started.  Meanwhile in Germany, Rene Hurlemann, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Oldenburg, began testing oxytocin about a decade ago. It is known as the âloveâ or âcuddleâ hormone because of its release while giving birth, breastfeeding and physical affection. Oxytocin could have salutary effects, Hurlemann hypothesized, on a number of conditions. He studied its presence in flirting couples, and then turned to its potential in treating social anxiety disorder and PTSD. Based on animal research, Hurlemann said, we know oxytocin is crucial to social bonds â could the hormone also be used to treat loneliness?  Hurlemann and Simone Shamay-Tsoory, a colleague from Haifa University, then began work on several studies of people whose loneliness is not caused by mental illness. (The literature is clear that while loneliness and mental illness can go hand-in-hand, and can mimic or commingle with depressive symptoms especially, it is distinct from depression.)  Their subjects undergo group psychotherapy, with a focus on discussing loneliness and participating in social activities. In addition, half of the participants undergo treatment with oxytocin, and the other half receive a placebo. Hurlemann and Shamay-Tsoory are hoping to discern whether oxytocin in the form of a nasal spray might accelerate the therapyâs treatment effects. Hurlemann says you would never prescribe oxytocin in the absence of psychotherapy â rather, the idea is that the spray could help speed along the bond between therapist and client, allowing therapists to treat more patients.  While he doesnât yet have conclusive results, Hurlemann said that the baseline oxytocin levels in the lonely people do not differ from the controllers, who arenât lonely. But introduce a social trigger, and things change.  The team developed an experiment wherein subjects had to complete an interview regarding topics such as the happiest moment in their life, and other positive memories. âNot only do individuals tend to release oxytocin in that situation,â he said, âthey have higher oxytocin levels afterwards and we could measure that. Whereas in the lonely people, this was not the case.â The lonely people had low oxytocin levels even after being confronted with positive memories â meaning lonely people experience a lower level of warm feelings than people who are not lonely, even when thinking about happy moments.  Hurlemann and his team found that there is a difference between lonely and non-lonely people in terms of activity in two brain areas, the amygdala â the brainâs fear center â and the nucleus accumbens â the brainâs reward center. Asked if this difference is permanent or if a lonely person could perhaps âfixâ the affected parts of their brain, Hurlemann said itâs too soon to know.  The study was on track for completion by the end of 2020, but due to Covid-19, it will take an additional 18 months.  â¢â¢â¢  Many psychologists, social scientists and therapists I spoke with expressed hesitance and caution about clinical solutions, favoring a psychotherapy approach to treating chronic loneliness.  Rachael Benjamin, a psychotherapist at Tribeca Therapy in New York, who leads a therapy group specifically for dealing with loneliness, thinks medicalizing it âmakes us feel more isolatedâ. She is not anti-medication and acknowledges that it can in fact be life saving â but it doesnât get to our most inner workings. âPills canât build intimacy,â she says.  âMany psychologists expressed hesitance and caution about clinical solutions.â The psychoanalysis couch of Sigmund Freud, as shown in the Tate Modern. Photograph: David Sillitoe/The Guardian  At his practice in Seattle, the psychotherapist Caleb Dodson treats loneliness with a method called existential analysis, based on the idea that by deeply understanding others, while remaining separate from them, lonely patients can learn, over time, to not be wounded by perceived social rejection. âThere are people that just wonât meet you where you are,â he says. âAnd that there is a lot of grief, but at the same time, in that grief, there is an intimacy that you can begin to cultivate with yourself, and the relationship with yourself [means] that you will never be lonely.â  In other words, being radically curious about the motivations and feelings of others can transform a lonely personâs experience of social pain.  Like Benjamin, Dodson is pro-medication in certain cases, and acknowledges that especially when treating clients with severe depression, sometimes medication is needed before their feelings and core issues can be accessed. But if the pendulum swings the other way and it gets to the point where medication keeps the client from âexperiencing their experienceâ, thatâs a problem.  It makes total sense that they would be developing a pill for this, because itâs such a common experience Caleb Dodson  He says: âIn a way, it makes total sense that they would be developing a pill for this, because itâs such a common experience, and because we donât know what to do with it, and itâs easier to give someone a pill than it is for them to go through therapy for â in my honest opinion, and the type of therapy that I do â years.â  Dodson says that while a loneliness pill could be helpful, âthe physicians would need to be educated and the patients monitored in relationship with the therapistâ. Obscuring or dulling the pain of loneliness could squelch the impetus to examine and learn from the feeling.  The sense of an âepidemicâ now drives popular discussion of loneliness â and that can itself skew possible solutions, according to Fay Bound Alberti, the cultural historian. She went so far as to call Murthyâs framing a moral panic, warning that âepidemic terminology is politically and socially powerful. It leads to knee-jerk political soundbites rather than thoughtful, historically informed discussion about what loneliness might mean.â  Bound Alberti also challenged John Cacioppoâs description of loneliness as an evolutionary, transhistorical phenomenon rather than a product of economic and social conditions. She argued that it is a modern phenomenon, born of an ever-increasing individualistic society. Thinking of it as an unavoidable, universal experience takes the pressure off of institutions and society at large, to do anything about it.  â¢â¢â¢  John Cacioppoâs research pace slowed for the first time in three decades when he was diagnosed with cancer in 2015, and took time off to treat it. Nevertheless, the work continued until his death in 2018. To cope with her grief, Stephanie Cacioppo went on long runs to produce endorphins in an attempt to ward off a grief-stricken depression, but sheâs hardly taken a break from loneliness research.  Until recently, she was recruiting for a study on how minorities experience loneliness. In November 2019, she co-authored a journal article proposing the possibilities of a genetic predisposition to loneliness and she told the Guardian last fall that she was cautiously optimistic that those in her study who received pregnenolone would report feeling less lonely than those who received the placebo. (Despite repeated requests and a preliminary conversation, she declined to be interviewed for this story.)  While some healthcare economists hesitate to put a hypothetical number on the potential market for loneliness drugs, Melissa Garrido, a health services researcher at Boston University, said pharmaceutical companies would be the greatest beneficiaries of pathologized loneliness. Itâs unclear whether any of them are currently backing any loneliness research, but people can already purchase some forms of oxytocin and pregnenolone for self-medication online, for around $.50 to $2.00 a dose from retailers such as Vitamin Shoppe, Walmart and Amazon.  Cheryl, the lonely game night host in Texas, says her âlife verseâ is Jeremiah 29:11: ââFor I know the plans I have for you,â declares the Lord, âplans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.ââ  She believes God has a plan for her, but admits itâs not a very satisfying one. âI know my joy is supposed to be in the Lord, but Lord, there are other things that I want to be happy about.â  These days, she doesnât talk much about how it hurts to not have children, to have not dated in 21 years, to be the one no one thinks to check on. She breezes past such topics and keeps a smile on her face, and before the pandemic, she made a habit of seeking out loners at parties and making them feel welcomed. Webster laughs and makes friends easily; people consider her popular.

Employers hit by Covid-19 are cancelling work experience or cutting back on graduate recruitment, leaving thousands of students to chase a shrinking number of opportunities.  Journalism graduate Alex Cutts missed out on internships at Sheffield Hallam University earlier this year. âThey had more than 1,000 applications, way more than they had for any of their graduate schemes in the past years,â she says. âIâm quite nervous about getting any work at the moment.â  Will 'clearing plus' really make it easier to apply to university? Read more  While this sounds daunting, missing out on work experience isnât the end of the world. Laura Bromley, a careers adviser at Lancaster University, explains: âThe types of people that employers are going to be looking for are the ones who were in a bit of adversity, but can show what they did to support themselves.â  Dan Hawes, co-founder of Graduate Recruitment Bureau, agrees. He says the key is doing what you can to answer the inevitable question: âWhat did you do during lockdown?â  Start with a skills audit  Itâs tempting to grab any training going but âdonât just do anything,â Hawes cautions. âTake a long look at the kind of skill set you need to build,â he adds. âLook for the gaps.â  Start by reviewing job adverts. Note which skills you already have, along with examples of when youâve used them. Then list those you need to work on, and use that to steer your efforts instead.  Get experience online  Virtual internships and remote work experience are a good option. Many universities and employers run schemes, so search for these first. They tend to be fiercely competitive but are usually paid, and will get you working on real projects.  Otherwise, see Inside Sherpa or Bright Network. These feature pre-recorded content and hypothetical tasks. The upside is theyâre available on-demand all year, plus international students wonât need to worry about visa limits.  Itâs easy to find professional training online, including workplace skills. Search FutureLearn and edX for free or low-cost options, or ask your tutors for recommendations.  Connect with peers  Career networks have thrived online during lockdown, and are more accessible for it. Chat forums and virtual coffee breaks are an ideal way to glean industry knowledge. Conversations with peers could also lead to work experience and training opportunities. Follow companies on social media or ask around online to see whatâs available in your field.  Hawes also suggests contacting your careers department. âThey may be able to connect you with the alumni society, which could be an untapped resource for finding work.â  Make your own experience  Bromley describes how one marketing student offered to help local businesses with promotions. That student learned about the job market, and was able to tell employers about times sheâd liaised with clients.  Hawes says that jobs arenât always advertised. Speculative applications may take a bit of luck, yet sometimes luck is all you need to get a foot in the door.  If you have a side business of any kind, tell employers what itâs taught you. The value isnât in the profits, itâs the experience you get from trying. Here, that could be everything from marketing to problem solving.  'I'm worried I'm not going to get a job': meet the corona class of 2020 Read more  Focus on skills over setting  âVoluntary work, no matter how small or insignificant, is a huge opportunity long-term,â Hawes says. Do IT is a good source for finding local roles. University societies are valuable, too. Some are dedicated to volunteering and fundraising. Others can lead to a range of professional skills, especially if you take an organisational role.  Bromley adds: âWhat are the issues and concerns in society right now? What can you do to support people? That could be organising community events or running workshops in schools. Start with what you know, and look for outcomes that benefit others as well as your CV.â  And donât overlook experience gained at home and from hobbies. These are good for showing off your soft skills â such as communication, creativity and persuasion. Frame them professionally on your CV by selecting examples relevant to the workplace.  Ultimately thereâs a wealth of places to get experience, Hawes says. âWeâve helped graduates before during downturns and theyâve come through it by being a bit more creative, a bit more proactive, and thinking laterally.â But he admits: âIâm not pretending itâs easy.â",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/06/how-can-i-boost-my-cv-if-i-cant-get-work-experience,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,081e31c0fc5b51dd5fbbe4ab978dae54d1c42f48d97c5cc61ee033181f006664,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

They booked a campsite in the Forest of Dean for two nights, and ordered âa load of random camping equipmentâ.  âWe hadnât had much time to prepare because work and been so busy,â Chandler said. âOnce we pulled all the stuff out of the garage, I thought, this is never ever going to fit. We got a puppy just before lockdown, so he was on my knee. The wine was under my feet, the kids were sat on all the bedding and pillows, and the back of the car was full.â  Chandler admitted she had been âdreadingâ the trip, as rain was forecast and she was hesitant about having to set up the tent. However, the family had an âamazingâ time.  âPutting the tent up was far easier that we thought, although it didnât take long for the dog to chew through one of the guy ropes,â she said. âSeeing the kids having the time of their lives was amazing, they had so much freedom, and we had time to read books, catch up on the news, and chill out.â  The family have already booked two further trips. âI canât see me giving up the villa just yet, but I can see us going camping for shorter breaks to get some time out,â Chandler said. âIt forces you to unwind, and thatâs really great.â  âI returned from a gruelling hike to find my tent in a bogâ  Facebook Twitter Pinterest John had never been on a camping trip before but found it cheaper than a usual holiday, and said the Lake District was âgorgeousâ. Photograph: Stewart Smith/Alamy Stock Photo  Two weeks ago, John, 27, and a group of school friends headed for the Lake District for a camping trip to enjoy a âCovid safeâ holiday together.  âI was very apprehensive at first, but this is the only way I could see them,â he said. âThis seemed like the safest way to maintain a distance but still share in the warmth of each otherâs company.â  John, who lives in Portsmouth, had slept in tents during musical festivals, but had never been on a camping trip before, and was in for a rude awakening.  âWe went on a hike up a nearby hill, and the path was steep and treacherous. Iâve been on walks before, and Iâm not out of shape, but this was a different beast. Part way up, the conditions got fairly bad, and we had the choice to keep going or go back down the horrible path. We carried on and didnât get an awful lot better,â John said.  âApparently it wasnât even a very big hill, one of the smallest in the Lake District,â he added.  When they returned, Johnâs tent had been soaked by a nearby river and the surrounding area became a bog.  âMy friend saw the tent first and started crying with laughter. Me and my girlfriend were both drenched and miserable. Weâd been holding on to the idea of a warm tent. We got in and salvaged what we could, mopped up and had to sleep in a damp tent. It was either that or drive six hours home into the night, so we thought we might as well just sleep in the puddle,â he said.  Despite this, John said he would go camping again.  âItâs not the sort of fun weâre used to in our normal lives, but it is good fun,â he said. âItâs cheaper than a usual holiday, and the Lake District is gorgeous, so really itâs not so bad.â  âI bought 33 camping items â the only thing that didnât come was the tentâ  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Kathrynâs camping plans are on hold until sold-out tents come back in stock.

We spent hours interviewing friends and family, and even had a spreadsheet.  âDebit card at the ready, we ordered everything from the tent to the spare pegs, the airbeds to the camping stove, the head torches to the she-wee, the sleeping bags to the rubber mallets.â  The family booked a campsite for the upcoming bank holiday and awaited their order. On Tuesday, they received an email from the store they had purchased the items from, saying that just one item was missing â the tent.  âIt was totally frustrating, but really funny,â she said. âEverywhere else is sold out, I think due to the demand from coronavirus.

The big challenge is figuring out how to make something a little healthier. Here, I have replaced some of that fat and sugar content with wholegrains, nuts and fruit.  I love coming up with new flavour combinations. Sometimes, I opt for contrasting flavours to create a balance that sings, like sweet and sour. Other times, as in this peanut butter sandwich number, I plump instead for complementary flavours to achieve a warm homogeneity. This pairing of fenugreek and cinnamon with the peanuts does exactly that. Perfect with a cup of tea.  Makes 14 biscuits  50g cooked quinoa  120g peanut butter, plus more for sandwiching  50g prunes  50g soft brown sugar  60g plain flour  30g wholemeal flour  Â¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda  1 tsp cinnamon  1 tsp ground fenugreek  Pinch of chilli powder  25g uncooked quinoa  Flaky sea salt  Put the cooked quinoa, peanut butter, prunes and sugar into a food processor and pulse until smooth. Add the flours, bicarb and spices, and blend until it looks like breadcrumbs. Tip out on to the counter, roughly knead into a dough, wrap in clingfilm and chill for 30 minutes.  In a dry frying pan, meanwhile, toast the uncooked quinoa until it pops, then remove from the heat and set aside.  Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas mark 5.  Remove the dough from the fridge and gently knead until pliable and not too crumbly. Roll out on a lightly dusted surface to 5mm thickness. Sprinkle the toasted quinoa and salt over the top and then gently roll it into the dough with your rolling pin. Cut into the biscuit shapes of your choice and transfer to a lined baking sheet.

At Meadowhall you can head back to town along the canal, or continue to Rotherham along the river (three miles). The path is mostly flat and wide, so is suitable for different levels of ability and there are public transport options (tram, train, bus) to easily return back to your starting point. Lots of options for food and drink at either end. Itâs surprisingly quiet given its location, with herons, kingfishers and even otters to spot, and local nature reserves to explore just off the route. Look out for the Spider Bridge.

Photograph: Michael Walters/Alamy  This is a stunning six-mile circular walk along the banks of the Nar, starting from Castle Acre village (free parking around the Bailey Gate and green). Set off heading away from the village, with the church on your left, and head down towards the priory (signposted) keeping the remains of the flintstone wall on your left. The tracks after this are narrow at times and not suitable for prams, thought there are some boardwalks. There are quite a few narrow plank bridges to cross. The chalk stream is beautifully clear and nice for a little dip if you want to. It is always very quiet â you rarely see more than a handful of people the whole walk, so itâs particularly good for social distancing. The full circle takes around two hours.

Lebanon is reeling from the extensive damage caused by the explosion on Tuesday evening, with the port area flattened and buildings further into the cityâs residential neighbourhoods damaged. Efforts to treat the injured have been hampered by the fact that hospitals are among the damaged buildings.  The blast was so powerful it was felt in Cyprus, 120 miles (193 km) away.  Lebanon president, Michel Aoun, said 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had been stored unsafely in a warehouse for six years. After an initial blast and fire in the port, it is thought that this was the cause of a second blast, with a massive fireball and white cloud sending a shockwave across the city.  Shop and apartment windows were blown out as far away as two miles (3.2 km) from the port, littering the streets with broken glass and causing hundreds of injuries.

Chinese fleet raises fears for GalÃ¡pagos sea life  'They just pull up everything!' Chinese fleet raises fears for GalÃ¡pagos sea life  Jonathan Green had been tracking a whale shark named Hope across the eastern Pacific for 280 days when the satellite transmissions from a GPS tag on her dorsal fin abruptly stopped.  It was not unusual for the GPS signal to go silent, even for weeks at a time, said Green, a scientist who has been studying the worldâs largest fish for three decades in the unique marine ecosystem around the GalÃ¡pagos Islands.  Alarm over discovery of hundreds of Chinese fishing vessels near GalÃ¡pagos Islands Read more  But then he looked at satellite images in the area where Hope was last tracked â more than a thousand nautical miles west of the islands â and noticed the ocean was being patrolled by hundreds of Chinese fishing boats.  âI began to look into it and found that at the very end of her track she began to speed up,â said Green, co-founder and director of the GalÃ¡pagos Whale Shark Project.  âIt went from one knot to six or seven knots for the last 32 minutes â which is, of course, the speed of a fishing boat,â he said.  The fishing vessels that Green saw on the satellite images are believed to belong to an enormous Chinese-flagged fleet which Ecuadorian authorities last week warned was just outside the GalÃ¡pagos Islandsâ territorial waters.  âI donât have proof but my hypothesis is that she was caught by vessels from the same fleet which is now situated to the south of the islands,â Green told the Guardian. She is the third GPS-tracked whale shark to have gone missing in the last decade, he added.  The Chinese fleet, numbering more than 200 vessels, is in international waters just outside a maritime border around the GalÃ¡pagos Islands and also Ecuadorâs coastal waters, said Norman Wray, the islandsâ governor.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest A female whale shark in the GalÃ¡pagos archipelago. âThe GalÃ¡pagos Marine Reserve is a place of very great productivity, high biomass but also biodiversity.â Photograph: Simon J Pierce  Chinese fishing vessels come every year to the seas around the GalÃ¡pagos, which were declared a Unesco world heritage site in 1978, but this yearâs fleet is one of the largest seen in recent years. Of the 248 vessels, 243 are flagged to China including to companies with suspected records of illegal, unreported and unregulated, or IUU, fishing, according to research by C4ADS, a data analysis NGO.  The fleet includes fishing boats and refrigerated container â or reefer â ships to store enormous catches.  Transferring cargo between vessels is prohibited under international maritime law yet the Chinese flotilla has supply and storage ships along with longline and squid fishing boats.  âThere are some fleets which donât seem to abide by any regulations,â said Wray.  One captain of an Ecuadorian tuna boat saw the Chinese fishing boats up close in early July, before the end of the tuna season.    âThey just pull up everything!â said the captain, who asked not to be named. âWe are obliged to take a biologist aboard who checks our haul; if we catch a shark we have to put it back, but who controls them?â  He recalled navigating through the fleet at night, constantly changing course to avoid boats, as their lights illuminated the sea to attract squid to the surface.  âIt was like looking at a city at night,â he said.  The longline fishing boats had up to 500 lines, each with thousands of fishhooks, he estimated, and claimed that some of the vessels would turn off their automatic tracking systems to avoid detection, particularly when operating in protected areas.  Chinese fishing practices first caught the attention of Ecuador in 2017 when its navy seized the Chinese reefer Fu Yuan Yu Leng 999 within the GalÃ¡pagos marine reserve. Inside its containers were 6,000 frozen sharks â including the endangered hammerhead shark and whale shark.  âIt was a slaughterhouse,â said Green, describing the images of the cargo hold. âThis kind of slaughter is going on on a massive scale in international waters and nobody is witnessing it.â  The seizure prompted protests outside the Chinese embassy in Quito; Ecuador fined the vessel $6m and the 20 Chinese crew-members were later jailed for up to four years for illegal fishing.  The arrival of the latest fleet has also stirred public outrage and a formal complaint by Ecuador as its navy is on alert for any incursion into Ecuadorian waters.  The Chinese embassy in Quito said that China was a âresponsible fishing nationâ with a âzero-toleranceâ attitude towards illegal fishing. It had confirmed with Ecuadorâs navy that all the Chinese fishing vessels were operating legally âand donât represent a threat to anyoneâ, it said in a statement last month.  Play Video 1:13 Chinese fleet vessels illuminate sea near GalÃ¡pagos to attract squid to the surface â video  However, Roque Sevilla, a former mayor of Quito, who is leading a team in charge of designing a âprotection strategyâ for the islands, said the fleet practices âindiscriminate fishing â regardless of species or age â which is causing a serious deterioration of the quality of fauna that we will have in our seasâ.  Ecuador would establish a corridor of marine reserves with Pacific-facing neighbours Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia to seal off important areas of marine diversity, Sevilla told the Guardian.  Protecting the Cocos Ridge, an underwater mountain range which connects the GalÃ¡pagos Islands to mainland Costa Rica, and the Carnegie Ridge which links the archipelago to Ecuador and continental South America, could close off more than 200,000 sq nautical miles of ocean otherwise vulnerable to industrial fishing, he said.  Shark finning: why the ocean's most barbaric practice continues to boom Read more  He added Ecuador had called for a diplomatic meeting with Chile, Peru, Colombia and Panama to present a formal protest against China.  âWhen the GalÃ¡pagosâs protected area was first created it was cutting edge,â said Matt Rand, director of the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy, âbut compared to other newer marine protected areas GalÃ¡pagos is now potentially lacking in size to protect the biodiversity.â  Milton Castillo, the GalÃ¡pagos Islandsâ representative for Ecuadorâs human rights ombudsmanâs office, said he had asked the prosecutorâs office to inspect the cargo holds of the Chinese ships based on the legal principle of the universal and extraterritorial protection of endangered species.  Chinaâs distant-water fishing fleet is the biggest in the world, with nearly 17,000 vessels â 1,000 of which use âflags of convenienceâ and are registered in other countries, according to research by the Overseas Development Institute.  Play Video 0:51 Footage shows Chinese fleet vessels transferring cargo in seas near GalÃ¡pagos â video  The fleet often fishes in the territorial waters of low-income countries, the report said, having depleted fish stocks in domestic waters.  Green said the âexplosion of lifeâ created by the confluence of cold and warm ocean currents around the GalÃ¡pagos Islands is exactly why the Chinese armada is hovering around the archipelagoâs waters.  âThe GalÃ¡pagos marine reserve is a place of very great productivity, high biomass but also biodiversity,â he said. The longline fishing technique used by the fleet catch big fish like tuna, but also sharks, rays, turtles and marine mammals like sea lions and dolphins, he added.  âThis is not fishing any more, it is simply destroying the resources of our oceans,â Green said. âWe should ask whether any nation on this planet has the right to destroy what is common ground.â",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/06/chinese-fleet-fishing-galapagos-islands-environment,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,4d7dd318202f716b403b3159c408aa2fd8aaa3b98fbfa8cf8a62379d7bd2cfb2,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

In a very big way. Since the English planning system was introduced in 1947, it has always been discretionary, meaning planning applications are assessed against a local plan on a case-by-case basis, with permission decided by a democratically elected planning committee of local councillors. The new system proposes to do away with all that. Land will instead be classified into three zones, with planning permission awarded automatically if proposals meet certain criteria.  What are the three planned new zones?  For growth New homes, hospitals, schools, shops and offices will be allowed automatically.  For renewal Proposals will be given âpermission in principleâ, subject to basic checks, largely on urban and brownfield sites.  For protection Preserving protected areas like the green belt and areas of outstanding natural beauty.  Boris Johnson cries 'nimbyism', but his planning changes will be disastrous | Simon Jenkins Read more  How would this speed things up?  The idea is that detailed local plans, which can take councils seven years to put together, will be abolished in favour of simplified housing plans and âdesign codesâ to be prepared within 30 months. If a scheme meets the code, it would automatically get permission.  The government is also proposing a âfast-track for beautyâ system to encourage developers to bring forward higher quality proposals â a recommendation straight from a commission headed by the late and philosopher Roger Scruton.  Is the planning system responsible for the shortage of homes?  There is no evidence that the planning system is an obstacle to house building. Records compiled by the Local Government Association show that about 90% of planning applications are approved, while there are more than a million homes with planning permission that have not yet been built.  How will the public have a say on new developments?  With difficulty. The move to a zonal system reduces the possibility for public input and democratic accountability by half. England currently has a two-stage process, where local councillors and the public can comment on both the formation of the local plan, and on individual planning applications.  The proposed reforms would give only one opportunity for democratic oversight, when the design code is first prepared. This could be many years in advance of particular schemes being given the green light.  What are the implications of moving to a zonal planning system?  In theory, a zonal system creates certainty: developers should be able to know what will and will not be allowed on a given site. Development in accordance with a code is automatically approved, as is any development not specifically prohibited by the code.  Such a system sounds simple, but it creates fertile ground for lawyers to battle over anything that might be considered novel or innovative, which might not be covered by the restrictive code. How good a zonal system is comes down to the quality and scope of the code, and an effective one takes years to hone. Because there is no flexibility to respond to new circumstances at the final consent stage, every aspect has to be considered in minute detail in advance and written into the zonal plan. The zoning resolutions for New York City, for example, stretch to more than 4,300 pages.  Our slum future: the planning shakeup set to blight English housing Read more  What about affordable housing and community infrastructure?  At present, developers contribute to affordable housing and things like parks and playgrounds through section 106 and the community infrastructure levy. Both of these would be scrapped and replaced with a new infrastructure levy that will be a fixed proportion of the value of the development, above a set threshold.  This sounds straightforward in principle, but there is no guarantee that developers will not be able to negotiate down their obligations on grounds of financial viability, as they do at present. The government is also proposing to extend the exemption from section 106 for small sites, to help developers âbounce back from the economic impact of coronavirusâ â meaning they wonât be obliged to provide affordable housing.  What is the first homes scheme?  The government is introducing a new âfirst homesâ scheme to offer new-build homes at a 30% discount for local people, key workers and first-time buyers. The discount will be locked into the home in perpetuity, ensuring future buyers can continue to benefit from it. It remains to be seen how this will be funded. Could it translate to another subsidy for house builders, in the mould of the help to buy scheme?",https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/05/how-the-planning-system-shakeup-will-affect-uk-housing,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,a76cb0f26b84591fd38fea846053bbecfce240bded022fb1ca86fdf7137b4214,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Hunger and neglect is what she finds  On a recent visit to the Navajo Nation, I sat with my parents in their garage while KTNN, a local Navajo radio station, played in the background. I listened to the beat of Navajo traditional two-step music and skip dance songs, thinking about the time in elementary school that my late grandmother stayed up all night to make me a traditional Navajo outfit for a fundraising event. In between songs, messages in DinÃ© encouraged listeners to stay home, pleading with the public to think of the safety and wellbeing of the Navajo Nationâs most vulnerable people: our elders.  Since the pandemic hit, memories and thoughts of my grandmother are ever present. The coronavirus, as of 4 August, has infected 9,139 people on the Navajo Nation and killed 462, many of them elderly.  What would it be like if my grandmother were here during Covid? I wondered. Could I keep myself from visiting for months? What would my family do to keep her safe?  When you grow up Navajo, at least for me, you are taught that elders are the pillars of the family, especially grandmothers. They are the keepers of our stories, history, traditions and culture. They connect us to our ancestors. They take care of us, and in exchange, weâre taught to look after them. When my late grandmother started to show signs of old age, I drove her to doctorsâ appointments, cared for her on weekends, and made sure she yearned for nothing.  Are elders around the reservation getting the attention they need during the pandemic? And, most importantly, do they have enough water and food? I decided to find out.  I began by interviewing people who live in the Northern Agency in north-west New Mexico, where my family is rooted. A large number of people over the age of 65 â nearly 350, according to Navajo Nation data â live in four remote communities along the foothills south of Shiprock. Dozens are 75 or older.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Edison Johnsonâs son lives just down the hill from him. Extension cords from his sonâs house are Johnsonâs only source of electricity. Photograph: Don J Usner/Searchlight NM  My first interviewee, a grandmother in her 70s, lives with her young granddaughter along a winding road in a small Navajo chapter in the rugged hills. When I arrived, the girl came running out of their cement home to greet me, then led me inside.  Her grandmother sat slumped over the edge of a stained mattress. I crouched nearby in an effort to maintain eye contact, taking care to maintain a safe distance. We talked about the pandemic, about life and death, and about her granddaughter. The girl had survived cancer and had lost her mother, while not yet 10 years old.  âIâm worried about my granddaughter,â the grandmother told me in DinÃ©. Tears ran down her cheek.  On this hot summer day, the two were alone, left to look after one another, something the grandmother takes pride in, and something they are used to. They have no running water or indoor plumbing. The grandmother has to trek to an outhouse, built on such uneven ground that she has tripped and fallen on numerous occasions, leading to a hospitalization. Now she has a wheelchair, which she has to use more and more often.  She is barely able to stand to make a meal. Her salvation â the only reliable food she and her granddaughter can get â comes from the local senior center, which delivers a lunch they share Mondays through Fridays. On weekends, they fend for themselves.  Other than a ripped couch, the home has little furniture. The girl has few toys. Her prized possessions are a few notepads, which are completely covered with drawings, one on top of the other, because sheâs used up every last page.  The grandmother said she and her son have taken care of the child since she turned four. When her son is away at his job, which is often, she is responsible for the girl.  âSheâs the only one that takes care of me,â the grandmother said. âWe take care of each other.â  Tears began to flood my eyes behind the surgical mask and Navajo scarf I wore. My voice turned shaky as I complimented her efforts to look after her granddaughter and thanked her in Navajo for sharing her story. Iâve been a journalist for almost 20 years, and it was the first time I cried on assignment.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Edison Johnson steps outside his home on the Navajo Nation, south of Shiprock. Photograph: Don J Usner/ SearchlightNM  I visited three other elders that week, at a peak of the Covid-19 crisis on the reservation.  Edison Johnson, a man in his 60s, lives in a dirt-floored shack with no running water, toilet, sink, kitchen â or electricity. He stores food in plastic coolers; he has no access to ice, so they keep nothing cool. Eating fresh food is almost impossible because there is no way to keep it from spoiling. He lives off of processed foods that keep without a refrigerator.  When he needs electricity, he runs a series of extension cords from his sonâs house to his own, at the top of a hill. âI wish I had an oven so I can make biscuits,â he said.  Elizabeth Woody, 70, gets her water from a faucet outside her house. She has no indoor toilet. If she needs to bathe, she explained, she fills a bucket with water and gives herself a sponge bath. Like the others I spoke to, she has no vehicle.  Why Native Americans took Covid-19 seriously: 'It's our reality' Read more  The elders complained very little. It was as if they had accepted this way of life â living in desperate conditions, largely ignored by their community and political leaders. They were used to not being taken care of.  And the few people in the community who advocated for them faced retribution, I was told. If people talked to the media, they feared they would lose their jobs. (Tribal employees and others remain anonymous in this column to protect them.)  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Sisters Elizabeth Woody and Mary Beach outside Woodyâs home on the Navajo Nation, south of Shiprock. Photograph: Don J Usner/ Searchlight NM  The grandmother said she had asked for assistance from her chapter, as local communities are known. Little help came. Some people advocated for her when she fell and injured herself: they demanded that the chapter build a level ramp to her outhouse. After a hard fight, she received an uneven slab of cement that was hardly better than the dirt she had before.  She did receive barrels of clean drinking water â but not from her chapter. Instead, it came from Water Warriors United, a Native-operated non-profit organization that delivers water to those in need.  Numerous other non-profits â some from as far away as California â have donated boxes of food to the chapters. The Navajo Nation, it is widely known, has some of the highest rates of hunger in the country; with a pandemic at hand, action was clearly needed to prevent a catastrophe. Throughout the past four months, the Navajo Nation president, Jonathan Nez, has handed out free food at most of the 110 chapters around the reservation.  But none of the elders I spoke to had received a food donation. They lived too far away. They had no one to pick up the boxes for them.  âAll in all, no one is caring for anyone. Theyâre just thinking about themselves,â a community worker told me. Some elders werenât even aware the free food deliveries were happening. They had no phone, television or computer. Their contact with the outside world came from Navajo radio stations such as KTNN. Some had no contact at all.  Even people who did manage to get a food box might go hungry. Some boxes only contained apples, oranges and onions, I was told. Others contained hard foods that elderly people couldnât eat because they so often had missing teeth. The boxes were supposed to feed people for a week, but some only held enough food for two days. Others included outdated toiletries that had expired in 2010. One source told me that she was so worried about the elders in her community, she often bought food for them out of her own pocket.

Photograph: Sharon Chischilly/Getty Images  Who was responsible? Chapter officials, neglectful family members, the community and â most of all â the Navajo Nation leaders, sources said.  And so I called the leaders. The only person to respond was Navajo Nation council delegate Amber Kanazbah Crotty, who represents seven chapters in the Northern Agency. Sheâs known as an advocate for senior citizens.  Crotty said she always has elders in mind, especially when looking at legislation. She asks herself, âHow is this going to support our elder population?â She said she makes a point to focus on elders because she believes that the way elders are treated is a reflection of how all DinÃ© should be treated.  Some elderly people do fall through the cracks, she said. She was working on a long-term solution â a case management system that would closely track eldersâ needs. But, to the best of her knowledge, food and other resources had been available to the elderly, even in remote areas.  âWe had food available for families in crisis or families that are testing positive while they isolate,â Crotty said. âThat would help elders with limited income, just making sure theyâre not exposed. So those are some of the immediate steps that weâre doing.â  Less than 24 hours after my interview with Crotty, one of my sources called me to say she no longer wanted to be named in my story. Her supervisor had spoken to her, and she and other employees were told to refrain from talking about the food shortages, especially to the media. âWe could lose our jobs,â the source said. Within the day, two community workers Iâd interviewed also backed out of the story.  Repeated follow-up calls and emails to Crotty went unanswered. My calls to local chapter officials also went unanswered. Attempts to reach the Navajo Nation president, Jonathan Nez, failed.  Throughout my time as a Navajo journalist, Iâve heard many stories of Navajo officials who stonewalled reporters or intimidated people who spoke out. Navajo Nation leaders often refused to answer questions from Navajo reporters and local media (although they showed little reluctance when it came to giving quotes to national media such as CNN and the New York Times).  I was aware of the frustrations. But to be shut out for a story about Navajo elders? That was something I never expected. I especially didnât expect it during a pandemic, when protecting elders lies at the heart of a public health campaign to slow the surge of Covid-19. I didnât expect it amid the constant messages to take care of our elders, which appear in Navajo Nation virtual town hall meetings, on Twitter, Facebook and television.  The reservation is my home. I have a deep connection and admiration for where my roots are planted. But itâs hard to ignore the darkness that coincides.  Now, when I listen to KTNN, I think of the elders I met, and wonder if theyâre listening, too. I think about the little girl who survived cancer and wonder what to send her for her birthday. (She wrote the date on a slip of paper and slipped it into my hand before I departed.) Five weekends have passed since I bid the grandmother and girl farewell. And every weekend since, Iâve wondered whether they have enough to eat and whether anyoneâs checked in on them. Iâve wondered if anyone else is wondering about them.

Keiko Ogura was eight years old when the Enola Gay, a US B-29 bomber, dropped a 16-kilotonne nuclear bomb on Hiroshima at 8.15 am on 6 August 1945.  An estimated 80,000 of the cityâs 350,000 people were killed instantly; by the end of the year, the death toll would rise to 140,000 as survivors succumbed to injuries or illnesses connected to their exposure to radiation.  Daughters of the bomb: my reckoning with Hiroshima, 75 years later Read more  Ogura, who was playing outside her home when the force of the blast swept her off her feet and knocked her unconscious, is one of a dwindling number of survivors who have made it their lifeâs work to tell their story. They hope, with increasing desperation, for a world without nuclear weapons.  âMy father had said that something didnât feel right that morning and told me not to go to school,â she said. The blast ripped the roof off the house she shared with her parents and two brothers, and destroyed much of the interior. But they had survived. âIt was dark and there was absolute silence. I didnât know what to do except crouch on the ground. All I could hear was the sound of my little brother crying.â  As evening fell, people who had been closer to the hypocentre a mile and a half away started arriving at their home. âThey had badly burned faces and hair, and their skin was hanging off. They said nothing â¦ they just moaned and asked for water.â  Ogura gave water she had fetched from a well to two people and watched in horror as they drank but then collapsed and died. âI didnât know that it was dangerous to give water to people in their condition. For 10 years I blamed myself for their deaths.â  Ogura is one of an estimated 136,700 remaining hibakusha â survivors of the atomic bombings â from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, including those who were in the womb at the time of the attacks. With an average age of just over 83, many suffer from chronic illnesses linked to their exposure to radiation.  More than 300,000 survivors have died since the attacks, including 9,254 in the past year, according to the health ministry.  A recent survey by Kyodo news agency found that more than three-quarters of survivors were âstrugglingâ to pass on their experiences, with many citing their advanced age. Only a fifth said they planned to continue sharing their stories.  Those like Ogura who have spent years talking to audiences in Japan and overseas, are frustrated by the lack of progress on nuclear disarmament, and fearful of a future without hibakusha testimony.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest A visitor looks at photographs of the Hiroshima bombing survivors, at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial museum. Photograph: Dai Kurokawa/EPA  âIn the beginning, it was really painful to remember those days,â said Ogura, who did not speak publicly about her experience for 40 years. âBut I wanted young Americans to know what their country had done. Iâm not blaming them for what happened, I just want them to know the facts, and think.â  Although he was only five at the time, Sueichi Kido recalls hearing the engine of the Bockscar, the American B-29 bomber that dropped a plutonium bomb on Nagasaki on 9 August, killing 74,000 people. âI remember someone saying that it didnât sound like a Japanese plane ... then there was a flash and a boom,â he told the Guardian.  âThere are things I remember very clearly about that morning and things I have no recollection of,â said Kido, a retired college teacher who, at 80, still serves as secretary general of Nihon Hidankyo, an organisation that represents survivors of both atomic bombings.  He was standing in front of his house a mile and a quarter from the hypocentre when the blast sent him flying through the air. His mother, who was standing nearby, was badly burned on her face and chest. âThere was nothing left of our neighbourhood,â he said. âEverywhere was black. I remember seeing charred bodies floating in the river.â  The man who survived Hiroshima: 'I had entered a living hell on earth' Read more  Six days later, Kido, his seven siblings and their parents sat around a wireless listening, for the first time, to the voice of their wartime emperor, Hirohito. âWe didnât really understand what he was saying, only that Japan had lost the war.â  This weekend, he will make his annual pilgrimage to Nagasaki from his home in central Japan, where he has lived for the past 40 years. âThere are not many of us left. Our time is coming to an end, and we all have to face up to that. But I will spend the rest of my life doing my best to make sure that I am part of the very last generation of hibakusha.â  Kidoâs determination is shared by Ogura, whose battle against survivor guilt has now been replaced by one against time.  âPeople like me wondered why they had lived when so many others had died,â she said. âI could never forget the two people who died in front of my eyes. But I will keep talking about what happened until my last breath, so that they and the other victims did not die in vain.â",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/06/to-my-last-breath-survivors-fight-for-memory-of-hiroshima-and-nagasaki,https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss,cc13a1891f77a7660e9910fea7be6674949d4f8894255d1b53a62abae7fb56d9,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:15:43.779117,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 00:00:42 GMT",'I don't care': young TikTokers unfazed by US furor over data collection,"Mauren Sparrow downloaded TikTok in March to pass the time during lockdown. Since then sheâs posted tutorials on crafting and videos of her two cats, Calcifer and Jiji, some of which have accrued millions of views and likes.    But with the Chinese-owned app now under fire over data privacy concerns, Sparrow, 29, and other young users have reacted with a resounding shrug.  Iâm so used to all social networks having my data that I feel itâs just the price I have to pay to connect with others Mauren Sparrow, TikTok user  âI donât really care that these corporations have my data as long as I know they have it,â Sparrow says. âAt this point, Iâm so used to all social networks having all of my data that I feel itâs just the price I have to pay to connect with others.â  TikTokâs future has been in flux for weeks after the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, hinted at a potential ban in early July. Most recently, Donald Trump approved of Microsoftâs efforts to acquire a part of TikTokâs business, but only if the deal was completed by 15 September. A price has not yet been arrived at but could top $10bn.  Threats of action against the app â which some US authorities fear could share user data with the Chinese government â sent shockwaves through the TikTok community, with many content creators rushing to launch live streams to direct followers to alternative platforms. Videos reacting to the potential ban ranged from technical tips on how to evade it, to anger at Trump, to indifference over data privacy.  âAm I the only one who doesnât care if China collects my data?â a user in one viral video stated. âLet [the Chinese government] have my data. They know me better than I know myself,â another joked.  TikTok is one of the worldâs most popular apps and has been downloaded roughly 2bn times, meaning a ban would not be easy, or popular. Forty-seven per cent of millennials and 59% of Gen Z â the biggest demographic on the platform â said the app should not be banned. Meanwhile, 25% of Gen Z users said they would be more likely to use TikTok if the US banned it. Just 9% said a ban would make them less likely to use it, according to a US survey from the market research firm Morning Consult.  âI think that there would be a riot if TikTok were somehow truly banned in this country,â Sparrow said.  The debate over TikTokâs future has also underscored the generational divide between the lawmakers legislating technology platforms and the people who use them. For Gen Z, which has grown up on Facebook, Snapchat and Instagram, having their personal data collected is a given. TikTok in particular thrives on oversharing, with young people using music to share embarrassing stories and photos of themselves, to the tune of millions of likes and comments. âSome of you are too comfortable on hereâ is a common refrain in the comments of videos.  On a more fundamental level, most do not believe they have the choice to opt out of data collection, said Josh Golin, the executive director of the non-profit Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood.  âIf you gave most young people a choice between protecting their privacy by getting off social media or staying on social media, they will stay,â he said. âBut what if you had a choice to be both on social media and have your privacy protected?â  With a historic hearing involving big tech firms last month and new data privacy laws in California and Europe, there have been incremental steps towards that goal. But many users are not in a hurry to force companies to change their data practices. Studies show Gen Z is more tolerant of targeted advertising and less bothered by surveillance. While 46% of Gen X and 45% of millennials are concerned companies will use their data against them, just 37% of Gen Z is worried, according to a 2019 survey from the marketing firm Mobile Marketer.  It feels ridiculous to worry about China when it seems everyone is literally recording us as we grow up Annie, 19-year-old TikTok user  Annie, a 19-year-old TikTok user who downloaded the app to pass the time during quarantine and now uses it daily, said she finds the US governmentâs focus on China âridiculousâ when US companies âdo the sameâ.  âOur personal data is collected by endless amounts of private corporations who just sell our details to the highest bidder,â said Annie, who asked to use a pseudonym to protect her privacy. âIt feels a bit ridiculous to worry solely about China when it seems everyone is literally recording us as we grow up.â  A spokeswoman from TikTok told the Guardian the companyâs security team was led by an experienced, US-based chief information security officer with âdecades of industry and US law enforcement experienceâ. All US user data was stored in the US, she added, with strict controls on employee access. The company has also released a series of informational videos on the app about how to keep user data private and secure.  While legislators worry, young users remain defiant about their plans to stay on the platform. Photograph: Rishi Deka/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock  âProtecting the privacy of our usersâ data is critical to TikTok,â she said. âWe know itâs not enough to build strong security protections; weâre also educating our community.â  TikTok does collect user data, but not significantly more than many US-based apps. While there are some legitimate concerns about the app â such as whether its content could be influenced by censorship in China or how securely the platform is coded â some have speculated that Trump is targeting TikTok in retaliation for his Tulsa rally, during which TikTok users organized campaigns to book tickets en masse then fail to show up, leaving thousands of seats empty.  Stunts like these, coupled with the appâs popularity in an election year, could make TikTok seem like a threat to the administration, said Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University.  âThere is a conservative side of TikTok, but the use of the platform for organizing, activating the masses and doing things to mess with the Trump administration is apparent,â he said.  But while legislators continue to fret, young users remain defiant about their plans to stay on the platform.  Nicole, a 16-year-old who lives in San Diego and uses TikTok as much as five hours a day, said she used it to stay connected with friends â especially during the pandemic. âI wouldnât leave even if Trump tried to ban it.â  She said her algorithm was geared toward her interests in spirituality, motivational videos and comedy and said TikTok âhas allowed people from different parts of the world to connect in ways I didnât think was possible.  âIt made us realize things we thought made us strange or weird were more common than what we thought.

Nobody, until maybe Susan Sontag, understood photography better than him. I went to the block where he grew up and found his house has been demolished and replaced by a condominium, an extraordinarily ugly, two-storey brick building with a wrought iron entrance. It was a horror of architecture.  I spotted these two boys at the end of the street and I knew I had found my subject. But you donât just creep up and take a picture, so I got talking to them. One of the boys was a mechanic, and they wanted to go for a drive around town but the car wouldnât start. It was a beautiful machine, all heavy steel and chrome from an era when American cars were just astounding.  The car didnât have a licence, so they had taken the plates from another vehicle. But they had run out of gas. I gave them a dollar to get it going and they ended up riding round the neighbourhood waving at people in total triumph for the rest of the day. They were only about 15.  Itâs an enormously emotional picture. The dog looks hurt, the kid looks hurt, he is physically dirty, and the car wonât start. But he isnât like the kids in Dorothea Langeâs work â you donât want to rush over and help him. Iâve never cared for those pictures. This isnât an image with a social message. It isnât a plea to buy this kid some soap or an announcement that âpoor white people need help, tooâ. Itâs just painful. The kid looks wounded and the viewer feels it.  I still feel like an outsider and Iâm proud of it. Iâm the least-known best-known photographer Danny Lyon  I was on fire when this shot was taken. I began in 1962 and, in the next seven years, I did everything Iâm known for. I shot marches of the civil rights movement in The Movement, I documented life inside the Texas prison system in Conversations with the Dead, and life in the Chicago Outlaws motorcycle club in The Bikeriders.  I have always liked outsiders. Rebellion has always been one of the finest characteristics of America. And I count the insurrection weâre seeing across the country today as part of that history.  People used to ask me why I was attracted to the outskirts of a society. But what was I supposed to photograph in suburbia? I find it stunningly boring. When I was growing up, it was all businessmen in drab flannel suits and fedoras who cared only about making money.  What has always interested me is emotion, and the first thing that happens when you ascend to the business class is you conceal your emotions. Iâve been reading Max Weber, the German sociologist. He captures extremely well how people who are âon the insideâ of a society function. The first generation of business people accumulate wealth, but the people who come after them just become like automatons, repeating the same processes for ever. I find something hateful about that world.  I was stunned to read 15 years ago that civilisation was in danger because of fossil fuels. How can you possibly explain to anyone why we are continuing the way we are? But the answer is always greed. Things will function that way until the destruction of life on Earth.  Even today, I still feel like an outsider and Iâm proud of it. Iâm the least-known best-known photographer, as someone once called me. Iâm still working, making films and photographing, though not at the pace of my youth. Photography is powerful â itâs practically an international language in the age of Instagram, but I still think itâs separate from other art forms.  Many years after I took the photograph, I gave a lecture in New York City with some of my work projected on to a screen behind me. When this image appeared, I gasped. Without thinking, I said: âI could never take a picture like this today.â I took this image 53 years ago, and I think the person who made the picture felt abandoned. I donât know why â I had parents, a girlfriend, a home, so it doesnât make sense. But I think that feeling was essential to this image.  Painters can change and rework their creations, but a good photograph is something you find. You seek out a vision. Thatâs why I got so excited when I looked down Ageeâs block in 1967. With a predatorâs instinct, I knew I had found something worth documenting.  Danny Lyonâs CV  Self-portrait, 1967. Photograph: Danny Lyon/Magnum Photos  Born: Brooklyn, New York City, 1942.

Beirut's governor has confirmed that 10 firefighters are missing following the blast  More footage of the burning warehouses taken from the roof of the building opposite shows the same warehouses on fire before they are blown to smithereens  An image of the warehouse taken some time before the blast shows the same sliding doors and white patch - though without writing on it - along with what appear to be the chemicals that exploded stored inside  The image emerged as:  Emmanuel Macron arrived in Lebanon, which was once ruled under French mandate, where he met with President Michel Aoun and visited the disaster site  French rescue teams, who are helping with the recovery, said there is a 'good chance' of finding survivors  Lebanese officials gave an investigating committee just four days to identify the culprits amid widespread anger at the government  Prince Charles and wife Camilla sent a heartfelt letter to the President of Lebanon, offering 'thoughts and special prayers at this desperately sad time'  Britain sent a Royal Navy ship to Beirut to help the city recover, along with a Â£5million humanitarian aid package and search and rescue teams  It was revealed that the warehouse was investigated as recently as December last year after a strange odor began coming from it, with a report concluding the 'dangerous' chemicals should be moved  Beirut Gov. Marwan Abboud said losses from the blast are estimated at up to $15billion  The tragic photo shows the final moments of firefighters sent to tackle a blaze at Warehouse 12 in Beirut's port before the chemicals stored inside exploded with the force of a small nuke - killing at least 137.  The image, verified by MailOnline, shows Mr Noon and Mr Hawa trying to prise the lock off a door beneath a sign that reads 'entrance 12', along with signs warning of hazardous chemicals inside.  The person who took the photo has been confirmed dead with the photo found on his phone. Beirut's governor has said 10 firefighters are missing after the blast, sparked when 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in the warehouse caught fire.  The image was being widely-circulated on Arab-language twitter accounts on Wednesday as people paid tribute to the firefighters, who are assumed to have perished.  Details from the image - such as the heavy grey sliding doors and white sign with Arabic writing - were also visible in a video taken outside the flaming warehouses as a fire, thought to have been sparked by a welder, took hold.  The video shows firefighters in similar uniforms to those seen in the photo as they assess the scene, seemingly unaware of the danger.  More footage taken from the roof of a building across the street shows identical warehouse buildings being consumed by smoke and flames, along with similar-looking signs on the warehouse doors.  That footage can be verified as genuine because it features a large metal support strut, that can be seen on the roof of a building opposite the warehouse in Google Satellite images.  Meanwhile a photo taken of the warehouse some time ago shows the same grey sliding doors, high square windows and white sign, though without an writing on it. That photo also purports to show sacks filled with ammonium nitrate that caused the explosion.  The second video also features other corroborating details seen in multiple pieces of footage from around Beirut, such as small explosions from what appear to be fireworks moments before the main blast takes place.  That video also features the moment the blast happens, obliterating the warehouse, badly damaging grain silos opposite, and sending out a shockwave that flattened nearby buildings and blew out windows across the city.  2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored within the burning warehouse exploded shortly after the images and footage were taken, leaving behind little more than a watery hole in the ground  The blast sent out a shockwave that pulverized nearby warehouses (pictured), shredded the interior of nearby buildings, and blew out glass panes across the city  An aerial image showing the devastation caused to Beirut's port by the blast, with costs estimated at up to $5billion  The blast almost completely destroyed the port along with a grain silo (pictured centre), which were an economic lifeline for Lebanon which was already suffering through an economic crisis  At least 5,000 people were wounded in the explosion which also left 300,000 homeless and caused damage estimated at up to $5billion, with half of Beirut's buildings affected.  Lebanon has placed every official responsible for the security of Beirut's port for the last six years under house arrest as it investigates a massive explosion which has devastated the city.  The country's political leaders vowed those responsible for the tragedy would 'pay the price', but customs officials pointed the finger of blame back at them - saying they were repeatedly warned of the danger but failed to act.  The dangerous load is understood to have been abandoned by Russian businessman Igor Grechushkin in September 2013 before eventually being transferred to the port where it remained for six years.  A ship carrying the load was detained en route from Batumi, in the ex-Soviet republic Georgia, to Mozambique, and never recovered.  On Tuesday evening a fire that started in Warehouse 9 before spreading to Warehouse 12, where the chemicals were being stored, igniting them and causing the blast.  Raghida Dergham of the Beirut Institute yesterday said: 'Storing Ammonium Nitrate in a civilian port is a crime against humanity that must not go unpunished.  'Condemnations are not enough. I'm safe but devastated. I lost friends. I lost my apartment. Had I been home, I would have lost my life.'  A view of the destroyed grain silo is visible through a blown-out window close to Beirut's port on Wednesday  Destroyed warehouses are seen near the port area in the aftermath of a massive explosion in downtown Beirut  Workers remove rubble from damaged buildings near the site of an explosion which brought devastation to central Beirut  People pick their way through the remains of their destroyed office building after a massive explosion in Beirut  An official source familiar with preliminary investigations blamed the incident on negligence. Lebanese citizens directed anger at politicians who have overseen decades of state corruption and bad governance that plunged the nation into financial crisis.  Director General of Lebanese Customs Badri Daher said the country's judiciary was told six times about the hazardous chemicals stored in a warehouse in the Lebanese capital.  Customs officials are understood to have asked authorities to move the dangerous substance from Hangar 12 due to the danger they believe it posed to the city and given to the army or sold to an explosives company.  'We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why,' Daher said.  Another source close to a port employee said a team that inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago warned that if it was not moved it would 'blow up all of Beirut'.  Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed those responsible will 'pay the price' as he declared a two-week state of emergency to deal with the crisis, urging all world leaders and 'friends of Lebanon' to donate aid to the country, adding: 'We are witnessing a real catastrophe.'  Documents published online suggested it could be given to the army or sold to an explosives company, but did not receive any replies, leaving the explosive cargo languishing in the now destroyed port area of the capital.  Ammonium nitrate is a chemical used in fertiliser bombs and is widely used by the construction industry but also by insurgent groups such as the Taliban and the IRA for improvised explosives.  Authorities have cordoned off the port itself, where the blast left a crater 200 meters (yards) across and shredded a large grain silo, emptying its contents into the rubble. Estimates suggested about 85 per cent of the country's grain was stored there.  Lebanon is highly dependent on imports, and the destruction of the port, along with the worsening cash crisis, have raised fears of shortages.  Two planeloads of French rescue workers and aid were sent to Beirut, and Macron was to arrive Thursday to offer support for the former protectorate. The countries retain close political and economic ties.  Other countries, including Greece, Qatar, Kuwait, Turkey and the European Union, have dispatched medical supplies, humanitarian aid and search-and-rescue teams.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599961/Hero-firefighters-trying-open-door-doomed-Beirut-warehouse-tragic-photo-named.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,b3d080e7f30d3dd415acfc0bf29b69349d80f3f01db84511296448eec9074a49,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

June Titterton-Fox, 61, wants to create the single-storey 'Field House' home in one of the two fields she owns in the Rutland village of Whitwell - and she has said it would be one of Britain's most energy-efficient properties.  The farmer, who has battled breast cancer and had two heart operations last year, wants the property to help her downsize with husband Andy, 57, from the five-bedroom house they currently own in the village.  But 15 neighbours have raised objections to the new '21st century farmhouse', claiming it would be a 'blot on the landscape' being in full view of the village's Grade II*-listed church and other local 'heritage assets'.  The local church, St Michael and All Angels, which stands on an elevated site in the village, is believed to date back to Saxon times and has existed on the site since at least the Domesday Book of 1086.  An artist's impression of the Â£400,000 three-bedroom eco-house proposed for a field in the Rutland village of Whitwell  June Titterton-Fox wants the home to help her downsize with husband from the five-bedroom house they own in the village  Mrs Titterton-Fox has said the 'Field House' home would be one of Britain's most energy-efficient properties  Neighbours are unhappy that the eco-home will be in the full view to the rear of the village's Grade II*-listed church (above)  A protest group called 'Whitwell Residents' has instructed solicitors to fight the case amid concerns that it 'could open the floodgates for similar projects gaining approval, thereby diminishing the rural assets of the county'.  Mrs Titterton-Fox, who has been a councillor on Rutland County Council since March 2017, has been left upset by people trying to stop her building the property in the village, which she said she had invested in for two decades.  She told the Stamford Mercury: 'I don't know why you'd object to something you can hardly see. There's been a concerted programme of intimidation through social media. It's really sad.'  Mrs Titterton-Fox, who has two sons and a three-year old grandson, added of her recent health scares: 'Going through that really makes you think about your future.  'We want to downsize to a three-bedroom property that will future-proof our requirements. It's all on one floor so as I get older I don't have to worry about stairs or falling.'  Fifteen neighbours have raised objections to the new '21st century farmhouse', claiming it would be a 'blot on the landscape'  Mrs Titterton-Fox hopes to create the single-storey 'Field House' home in one of the two fields she owns in Whitwell  Mrs Titterton-Fox has been left upset by people trying to stop her building the property (cross-section pictured) in the village  One resident wrote: 'Field House will... ruin the look of this unassuming village. The design is very innovative, in the correct setting it would not be a problem - but not in keeping with this village.'  And another said: 'The development will not add value, enhancement to the village or local surroundings, indeed quite the opposite. It will devalue all adjoining properties and will become an eyesore.  'The proposed location is totally inappropriate for this modern design building and will create noise and light pollution in addition to a significant loss of privacy to adjoining neighbours.  'The plans lack detail around key issues such as outbuildings, parking, visitor movements, plant and machinery storage and access to key services.'  'No regard has been made to the Heritage Status of the village and the fact the development will be seen from most vantage points of the village.  Mrs Titterton-Fox began renting the two fields in 2002 before buying them in 2004, and is now hoping to build the house  The application is likely to be considered by the council's planning committee in October or November this year  Neighbours are unhappy about the home being in full view of the village's Grade II*-listed church and other 'heritage assets'  Mrs Titterton-Fox, who began renting the two fields in 2002 before buying them in 2004, started farming with sheep before moving onto cattle and pigs â and she now sells surplus meat under the name 'June's Farm'.  Speaking previously to East Midlands website Great Food Club, she said: 'I have always been a fan of the TV series The Good Life so when an opportunity came up to buy a house in Whitwell with some land, we moved.'  But local residents have claimed the council gave Mrs Titterton-Fox preferential treatment by giving her a grant paying for 40 per cent of the Â£3,000 required for a pre-planning design review of the home.  However, the farmer said anyone in Rutland could get this grant and she did not apply in the end. Her application is likely to be considered by the council's planning committee in October or November this year.

Boris Prokoshev, who was at the helm of tanker Rhosus in 2013 when it had to make an emergency stop in Lebanon, said he wrote to Vladimir Putin regularly about the dangerous vessel after it was impounded.  Prokoshev, now 70, said Igor Grechushkin, the owner of the vessel and the ammonium on board, had 'washed his hands' of the vessel, leaving the crew and cargo stranded for months.  The crew were freed the following year and the ammonium placed in a warehouse where it sat for six years, until it was ignited by a fire earlier this week - causing a blast that has killed at least 137 people and wounded 5,000.  Boris Prokoshev (left and right), captain of a Russian vessel carrying 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate that ultimately caused the Beirut blast, says he issued warnings over the vessel  Prokoshev was at the helm of the Rhosus (pictured) in 2013 when it had to make an unscheduled stop in Beirut due to engine problems, where it was impounded for a year  Prokoshev explained that the Rhosus was en route from Batumi, in Georgia, to Mozambique with its dangerous cargo when it had to make an unscheduled stop in Beirut due to trouble with its radar and engine.  The vessel spent more than a year in port, with Prokoshev and a handful of Ukrainian sailors aboard, as the Lebanese tried to extract fees and fines from Grechushkin.  In the wake of the explosion, Grechushkin appears to have gone into hiding amid reports that he is being hunted by the secret services in Cyprus where he resides.  Prokoshev claims that he wrote to Putin 'every month' while the ship was being held, adding: 'The vessel's owner abandoned it.  'The owner abandoned the cargo, ammonium nitrate. It is an explosive substance. And we were abandoned too.  'We were living on a powder keg for ten months without being paid.'  He told Putin that he had been left in limbo with the explosive cargo by the Russian owner of the vessel.  He wrote: 'Our condition is worse than prisoners. A prisoner knows when he will be released. We do not know.'  During a year in confinement, Prokoshev said he wrote to Vladimir Putin every day about the dangerous cargo, urging the Russia state to intervene  Prokoshev accused businessman Igor Grechushkin, owner of the cargo, of 'washing his hands' of it - though said ultimate blame for the disaster lies with Lebanon  He was officially told that his appeal for Putin to act over the ship had been passed to the Russian Foreign Ministry.  He said the consul in Beirut had mocked him asking: 'What do you want - Putin to send special forces to be released here by force?'  Eventually the crew were allowed to go home after they successfully mounted a legal challenge in Beirut claiming that they were being detained illegally.  Then the ammonium nitrate was 'unloaded to the warehouse, under the responsibility of the (Lebanese) Ministry of Transport,' said the captain.  'I learned about this from sailors who came to Beirut. The ship eventually sank, two or three years ago.  'It had a small hole, it was necessary to periodically pump out water. And without a crew there was no-one to do it.'  Asked about this week's explosion, he said the Lebanese authorities were responsible.  'They are to blame. There was no point in arresting this ship. It was necessary to get rid of it as soon as possible,' he added.  And given they kept the cargo, they should have used it as fertiliser rather than leave the unstable load in the port.  The ammonium was eventually impounded by Lebanon, where it was allowed to sit in a warehouse for six years before it detonated during a fire, killing at least 137 people  'They could take out to the fields,' he said. 'If nobody claimed the cargo, it means that it is nobody's.'  The conditions on the ship have been recalled by those on board.  Semyon Nikolenko, hired as an electrical engineer on the Rhosus , said the management were 'not good', reported RT.  'It was my first contract, my first [sailing] experience â and a bitter one,' said the sailor, now living in Crimea.  Grechushkin was a 'sly' man who was 'all talk' and did not deliver on his promises.  At one point the sailors went on strike in a bid to demand action.  They barely had enough to eat, say those on board.  The crew were not paid and Grechushkin pleaded bankruptcy - but Prokoshev has disputed this.  The owner's son is known to have attended private school in Cyprus.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599983/Captain-ship-carried-explosives-Lebanon-says-warned-dangers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,7fa88e75154a493d3eb98fbf3c614eeac24306d267623b4331cdbd871fc6af2a,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Created in the 1820s, the garden features 3,500 rose bushes planted around a central fountain.  Blooming lovely: Windsor Castle is to open its East Terrace Garden to the public for the first time in more than 40 years  Royal paradise: The garden was initially planted to create a pleasing view from the royal apartments along the eastern facade  Final touches: A gardener prunes the roses of Windsor Castle's East Terrace Garden, which opens to the public on Saturday  It is thought the garden has been kept closed off because caretakers feared large number of visitors could damage the grounds. However this year the Covid-19 crisis means there are far fewer people making the journey.  The garden was initially planted to create a pleasing view from the royal apartments along the eastern facade of the castle.  'The first garden built here was created in 1824 during the reign of George IV. But before that, in the Middle Ages, it would have been the defensive ditch,' said Richard Williams, Learning Curator at Windsor Castle.  'To protect the castle walls, Charles II in the 17th century created this terrace that we're standing on and also put in bowling lawns because he really enjoyed bowling.'

During World War Two the garden was completely dug up in order to plant vegetables.

They grew sweet corn and tomatoes, beans as well, I think, all as part of the war effort - doing their bit.'  The current appearance of the garden is the brainchild of the Duke of Edinburgh.

And bailiffs could even be sent into the homes to seize and sell their possessions if ministers decide to support replacing the criminal sanction for licence-fee evasion with a civil penalty.  New call centres manned by 800 staff are being set up to deal with questions and some expected resistance from the over-75s about the fee.  It is estimated that it will cost the BBC Â£38 million in the first year and Â£13 million in subsequent years, reported The Daily Telegraph.  The BBC is putting tens of millions of pounds towards chasing pensioners for their license fee payments as the corporation has said it plans to âenforce the lawâ (stock photo)  Over the next five years setting up the additional services to make sure people pay their license fee will cost Â£90 million.  There are around 4.5 million over 75s who will have to pay the licence fee this year. If all of them do it will bring in around Â£700 million to the corporationâs coffers.  However the BBC faces a humiliating stand-off with tens of thousands of pensioners who âwill not payâ for a TV licence as result of its controversial new over-75s scheme.  A campaign group for pensioners revealed many thousands of older people could rebel against the fee.  The National Pensioners Convention predicted the ranks of those refusing to pay is likely to be swelled by pensioners under the age of 75 who would also not pay the charge in a show of âsolidarityâ.  Bailiffs could even be sent into the homes to seize and sell their possessions if ministers decide to support replacing the criminal sanction for licence-fee evasion with a civil penalty  But charities have aired their concern about the prospect of bailiffs being used to enforce payment of the fee if it changed from a criminal offence to a civil penalty.  Age campaigners told The Times that the prospect of debt collectors turning up at pensionersâ doors was 'distressing and frightening'.  And yesterday, charity Age UK criticised the BBC for sending out 'long and complex' letters to the over-75s about its new TV licence scheme.  The documents fail to make it clear when the elderly will get a demand for payment after millions lost their right to a free licence.  The changes in who pays the licence fee came into force on August 1 but the broadcaster has only just sent out the first letters telling the elderly what to do.  They will tell pensioners that if the BBC has not heard from them within two months, their licence will be cancelled automatically.  Bosses intended to launch the scheme in June but delayed it because of the Covid-19 pandemic.  What will the letter to the over-75s about the new TV licence say? The letter will tell pensioners that their licence will cover them from August 1 to the end of July next year. But it says those spreading the cost of the licence will have to do so over a shorter period 'for this licence only'. These payments will depend on 'when you respond and how long it takes us to set up your payment plan'. It adds if it has not heard from them within two months of them getting the letter their licence will be 'cancelled automatically without charge.' If people contact TV Licensing after the licence has been cancelled to say they need one, the new licence will be 'backdated to 1st August 2020' and they would need to 'pay the full licence fee over the duration of the new licence'. Advertisement  Age UK criticised the switch as 'complex' and described the 'bundle of papers' explaining it as 'quite long'.  It warned that those with dementia would face particular problems.  Charity director Caroline Abrahams said: 'The BBC can't be criticised for not giving older people much information about their new TV licence scheme but the problem is their plan is complex and the bundle of papers explaining it quite long.  'It's likely that some older people will get lost in the detail and wonder what they are supposed to do.  'The over-75 population is hugely diverse so while some will no doubt navigate the documentation with ease, others may find this impossibly hard.  'If they have families or friends to help, that will make a big difference but there are many older people on their own who cannot rely on support.  'The BBC's pack omits the one piece of information many older people will most want to see: When they are likely to receive a letter asking them to pay.  'In the absence of this, some will be concerned that they have somehow missed their letter and are liable to be found at fault.'  She said others will be 'adamant' they are not going to pay for a licence 'come what may'.  The community organisation Silver Voices is urging all over-60s to cancel their TV licence direct debits and instead offer to pay with monthly, backdated cheques.  The aim is cause chaos for TV Licensing's administration systems, which will make collection and enforcement unworkable - but avoid protesters risking prosecution by refusing to pay.  A group spokesman told The Times: 'It defies belief that, as a second wave of coronavirus marches over the horizon, the BBC are doing this. It shows a lack of compassion, a lack of empathy, a lack of understanding.'  And Jan Shortt, of the National Pensioners Convention, added: 'We cannot condone people breaking the law. But, individually, each member will take their own choice. There will be people who refuse to pay.'  The BBC says it has 800 additional staff to deal with queries from the over-75s and has dealt with more than 300,000 calls on the issue since March.  A spokesman said: 'Over-75s will start to receive letters about how to set up their new TV licence from today.  'No one needs to do anything until they have the letter, whether that's paying or applying for a free licence, and no one needs to leave their home.  'We are also working with hundreds of money advice and community organisations to reach older people.'  The BBC said 450,000 older viewers have applied for a free licence and those who have to pay can choose instalments.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8598327/BBC-threatens-pensioners-bailiffs-dont-pay-licence-fee.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,b87cb2bac0a2928ab34f900f96c7d2ef489c0259ffd815aa80bec1fc860796f1,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

'What we saw at the time was a wedding venue on Pinterest. What we saw after was a place built upon devastating tragedy.'  The comments have sparked debate on both sides of the Atlantic, with Twitter users torn over whether it is appropriate to 'ignore' the dark history of a dream wedding venue.  Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds made headlines this week when he admitted it had been a 'giant mistake' to marry wife Blake Lively on a former plantation. The couple tied the knot in 2012 at Boone Hall, pictured, a 730-acre estate in South Carolina that relied on slave labour  The issue could prove problematic for some stately homes and castles across the UK which have their own dark pasts rooted in the British slave trade.  Slavery and the British Country House, a book published by English Heritage in 2013, examined in detail the links between the nation's great houses and its colonial past.  Some, including Grade I-listed Harewood House, near Leeds, were built using money derived from slavery. Others were inhabited by wealthy businessmen in the trade.  Here, FEMAIL examines the dark histories of four popular British wedding venues.  HAREWOOD HOUSE, WEST YORKSHIRE  Harewood House, a Grade -I listed building in West Yorkshire, was built in the 18th century for Barbadian-born landowner Edwin Lascelles, 1st Baron Harewood. Edwin later acquired a vast portfolio of West Indian property. In just 14 years more than 2,947 slaves were acquired  Sitting in 1,000 acres, Harewood House, a Grade -I listed building in West Yorkshire, was built in the 18th century for Barbadian-born landowner Edwin Lascelles (left), 1st Baron Harewood. It was inherited by his cousin, Edward Lascelles, 1st Earl Harewood (right), a slave trader  Sitting in 1,000 acres, Harewood House, a Grade -I listed building in West Yorkshire, was built in the 18th century for Barbadian-born landowner Edwin Lascelles, 1st Baron Harewood.  At the time of its construction (1759-71), Edwin owned neither slaves nor plantations. However the wealth underpinning the estate derived from an immense West India fortune created by his father, Henry Lascelles (1690-1753), who owned a Barbados plantation (sold off in 1758) and set up a syndicate investing in slaving.  Edwin later acquired a vast portfolio of West Indian property. In just 14 years, between 1773 and 1787, more than 27,000 acres and 2,947 slaves were acquired, worth Â£293,000 (about Â£28.3 million).  Ties to the West Indies were strengthened still further when Edwin died childless and the estate was inherited by his cousin, Edward Lascelles, 1st Earl Harewood.  Edward made an incalculable fortune from buying and selling men and women out of Africa. He then locked them up for months on so-called factory ships, from which they were eventually dispatched to the New World. Many died on the voyage from Africa to Barbados, while countless others were murdered or executed when they rose in rebellion at their savage treatment upon arrival.  Today Harewood is an upmarket wedding venue and serves as a filming location. The Downton Abbey film and ITV series Victoria were both partly filmed on site. Part of the estate has been developed as the village in the ITV soap opera Emmerdale.  LEIGH COURT, SOMERSET  Leigh Court, in Abbots Leigh, Somerset, was constructed in 1814 by Bristolian businessman Philip John Miles. Philip John Miles was a major beneficiary of the Slave Compensation Act, in which slave owners were paid for enslaved people freed in the colonies  Built on the site of a house of rest for the monks of St Augustine's Abbey and then an Elizabethan mansion, the current Leigh Court, in Abbots Leigh, Somerset, was constructed in 1814 by Bristolian businessman Philip John Miles.  Leigh Court, in Abbots Leigh, Somerset, was constructed in 1814 by Bristolian businessman Philip John Miles, pictured  According to Madge Dresser, an Honorary Professor of History at the University of Bristol, Miles 'built on his father William's success as a planter and trader, to become Bristol's first sugar millionaire and its largest West India merchant'.  Writing in Slavery and the British Country House, Professor Dresser notes Miles' family business papers 'contain mortgages dating from the 1760s and 1770s for the Vallay, Rhodes Hall and other 32 Jamaican plantations containing hundreds of enslaved Africans'.  Philip John Miles was a major beneficiary of the Slave Compensation Act, in which slave owners were paid for enslaved people freed in the colonies. Records show he sought over Â£36,000 for over 1,700 slaves at plantations in Jamaica and Trinidad.  Leigh Court, a Grade II-listed property, is now a private conference centre and wedding venue.  STORRS HALL, CUMBRIA  Originally constructed in the 1790s for landowner and politician Sir John Legard, Storrs Hall was substantially remodelled and enlarged in 1808-1809 by John Bolton, a Liverpool slave owner and slave trader. Storrs Hall, pictured, is now a hotel  Originally constructed in the 1790s for landowner and politician Sir John Legard, Storrs Hall was substantially remodelled and enlarged in 1808-1809 by John Bolton, a Liverpool slave owner and slave trader.  Originally constructed in the 1790s for landowner and politician Sir John Legard, Storrs Hall was substantially remodelled and enlarged in 1808-1809 by John Bolton, pictured, a slave trader  Bolton's fortune originated in slave-related business. He began his career as an apprentice for the Liverpool West India partnership of Rawlinson and Chorley, Professor Jane Longmore, Vice Chancellor of the University of Cheshire, wrote in Slavery and the British Country House.  'In 1773 he was sent out to St Vincent and returned to the UK 15 years later when he began his own counting house and engaged in slaving and trade in West India produce,' Professor Longmore continued.  The Transatlantic Slave Trade Database shows him as participating in 69 slave voyages between 1788 and 1807. Initially (1788-1791) Bolton was one of a dozen or so partners in the voyages but subsequently he appears as the sole owner in the vast majority of them. His activity peaked between 1798 and 1805, in each year of which he sent at least five ships from Liverpool.  Storrs Hall, on Windermere, is now a private hotel which hosts weddings.  A Storrs Hall spokesperson said: 'Some of the more extreme stories about John Bolton's use of Storrs do not have any historically documented basis, they have however become part of folklore, as promoted by a local visitor attraction.  'He was the third owner of Storrs and extended the original building; when later owners turned it into a hotel in the late 19th century it was extended and more than doubled in size again. The debate about the heritage left by people who made their fortunes in the slave trade, is one that is right to have.'  FRAMPTON COURT, GLOUCESTERSHIRE  Set on 1,500 acres, Frampton Court hosts an annual country fare and is a coveted wedding venue. It has associations with slavery, although none as concrete as other properties  Set on 1,500 acres, Grade I-listed Frampton Court hosts an annual country fare and is a coveted wedding venue.  However Professor Dresser notes the estate has 'associations with slavery' although they are 'harder to determine with precision'.  The current stone mansion was rebuilt in 1730 by Richard Clutterbuck, who had inherited Frampton from his father William Clutterbuck, who in turn had been given the estate by his grandfather John Clifford in 1684.  Professor Dresser writes: 'Richard Cutterbuck made his fortune as the Bristol Controller of Customs and whose father seems to have served in the more lowly office of customs server before him.  'Given his role of regulating the merchandise going in and out of the port at the height of Bristol's involvement in the African trade, it is virtually certain that Richard Clutterbuck profited from it, either directly or covertly through loans, bribes or emoluments.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8595833/Would-ditch-dream-wedding-venue-history.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,eb43e92e665a3d809020cc328f32deb1744d82267ac3c39fd8e7a75b26d0fbcd,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

2020-08-06 13:15:57.181561,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 11:46:34 GMT",Coronavirus cases continued to fall after some lockdown measures were eased in June,"Coronavirus cases continued to fall after some lockdown measures were eased, a major study revealed today.  Some 123 Britons were diagnosed with the infection out of a sample size of nearly 160,000 people between June 9 and July 8 â an incidence rate of 0.07 per cent. This was down by almost half from May, when 159 people out of 120,620 tested positive (0.13 per cent).  Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the research showed 'we were able to keep rates of infection low as some restrictions were lifted'.  Non-essential shops were allowed to reopen on June 15, and ministers allowed single-person households to mix with other homes for the first time since the lockdown was introduced on March 23.  But the effect of the changes on July 4 â when the two-metre social distancing rule was halved and pubs, restaurants and cinemas reopened â won't be felt until the Imperial College London team's next report.  Cases appear to have slowly crept up since 'Super Saturday', according to the Government's official statistics. Around 800 people are catching the virus a day â up from a four-month low of 546 on July 8.  The same study also found more than eight in 10 people who tested positive for coronavirus in June and July had no symptoms.  Some 123 Britons were diagnosed with the infection out of a sample size of nearly 160,000 people between June 9 and July 8 â an incidence rate of 0.07 per cent. This was down by almost half from May, when 159 people out of 120,620 tested positive (0.13 per cent)  The REACT-1 study was carried out by Imperial, its sister NHS trust and the market research firm Ipsos MORI.  It is the largest research of its kind in the UK and involved testing a random 160,000 people with nasal and throat swabs to check for current infection between June 19 and July 8.  The study also found 81 per cent of the latest batch of patients were asymptomatic and showed no signs of the illness.  Normally, experts would expect around half of infected people to suffer from symptoms such a new, persistent cough, fever or a loss of taste or smell.  For comparison, 69 per cent of people who tested positive in the study's first period â from May 1 to June 1 â were found to be asymptomatic.  But it is likely a chunk of these asymptomatic patients went on to develop symptoms later because the virus has an average incubation period of five days.  However, the sheer volume of cases without symptoms highlights how difficult it is for public health officials to contain the virus' spread.  The report warned these people were likely 'a source of ongoing transmission' that are helping the disease enjoy a resurgence in the UK.  Thousands of coronavirus deaths 'will be wiped off the government's official toll' Thousands of coronavirus deaths are set to be wiped from the government's official count, it was claimed today. Health Secretary Matt Hancock last month ordered an urgent review into how daily death counts are calculated in England because of a 'statistical flaw'. Academics found a glitch in Public Health England's methods that meant ministers counted victims as anyone who died after ever testing positive for Covid-19 â even if they were hit by a bus after beating the disease months later. It would've meant that, technically, no-one could ever recover from the virus and all 265,000 of England's confirmed patients would eventually have had their deaths attributed to the disease. The blunder could see up to 4,000 deaths removed from England's official toll of 41,749, according to reports. Mr Hancock is set to bring the figures in line with Scotland and Northern Ireland, which only attribute deaths to Covid-19 if it occurs within a month of their diagnosis. The Health Secretary is expected to announce the new measurement by the end of the week following the two-week review into the counting fiasco. The statistical flaw was uncovered by Oxford University's Professor Carl Heneghan and Dr Yoon Loke, from the University of East Anglia. Professor Heneghan, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the prestigious university, told the Sun: 'It is a sensible decision. There is no point attributing deaths to Covid 28 days after infection. 'All it does is muddy the water. While deaths are falling in Scotland, PHE data suggests matters are worse in England. 'But if it's someone who picked up the virus in a care home in March and recovered, and last week died of a heart attack, what does that actually tell us?' Advertisement  But the study found that there was an 'increased infection intensity in and near London' during the same time period.  The capital had a prevalence rate of 0.15 per cent, which was more than double the national average (0.07 per cent). Twenty-three out of 15,750 Londoners tested positive.  The researchers estimate that, in total, there were 40,000 people in England with Covid-19 at any one time, compared with 74,000 in May.  They found that there were no difference in prevalence of the virus between different age groups or sexes.  But they said that people from black, Asian and ethnic minority (BAME) backgrounds were 'more likely' to test positive, although they did not reveal exact figures.  BAME people have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19, for reasons scientists can't quite pin down.  They believe it may be a mixture of social factors, including the fact BAME people are more likely to live in deprived areas, live in large households and use public transport, where they interact with more potential carriers of the disease  The report also found no difference in infection rates among health and social care workers compared to the general public.  This suggests measures to curb transmission of the virus in hospitals and care homes were working, the researchers said.  Mr Hancock said: 'This research highlights how, thanks to everyoneâs efforts and sacrifice, alongside targeted measures to counter the spread of this virus in health and care settings, we were able to keep rates of infection low as some restrictions were lifted.  'However, we must not be complacent. I urge everyone to get a test if you have symptoms, self-isolate and provide your contacts to NHS Test and Trace so we can continue to keep the virus at bay and get back to normal.'    Professor Paul Elliott, director of the programme at Imperial College London, said: 'Through our community testing programme, weâre beginning to build a more informed picture of COVID-19 across England.  'This surveillance programme is showing us the prevalence of infection between different demographics, age groups and ethnicities as well as giving us insight into how easing lockdown restrictions are affecting the infection rate.'  Reacting to the findings, Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious diseases expert at the University of East Anglia, said: 'The primary conclusion from this study was that there was a decline in prevalence between the first round (in May) and the second round and within both rounds one and two.  'This finding is not surprising as it fits exactly with the reports of pillar 2 testing positive results that are reported each day.  'There is general agreement that the relaxations in lockdown restrictions in early June were not sufficient to push the R value above 1.  'The REACT-1 study has shown that the rate of decline had slowed between round 1 and 2 suggesting that the relaxations in early June did allow the R value to drift up.  'The study does not enable any conclusions to be drawn about what impact any of the further relaxation from late June onwards may have had.  'Indeed, it is likely that the impact of any relaxation will not be seen in swab data for at least a week or two after implementation.  'The fact that pillar 2 reports are increasing does raise concerns that the R value has increased above 1 at least in some parts of the country.  'The big uncertainty at present is how much of the increase in pillar 2 positive reports is due to a real increase in infections and how much to increased testing. We will need to await the results of REACT-1 round 3 to be able to answer this.'  The figures add to mounting fears of a second wave in Britain, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson understood to be 'extremely concerned' about cases bubbling up in the UK and in other European nations that have relaxed tough lockdown measures.  France has warned it could lose control of Covid-19 'at any moment'.  But the number of patients being admitted to hospital has yet to spike, bolstering claims from top scientists that the outbreak is not getting worse and cases are only rising because more patients are being tested.  Just 109 coronavirus patients were admitted for NHS care across the UK on August 2 â a figure which has barely changed throughout July.  During the darkest days of Britain's crisis in April, around 3,500 patients were needing hospital treatment every day.  It comes as Aberdeen became the latest city to be put back into lockdown as pubs, cafes and restaurants were shut on Tuesday.  Officials last week imposed tough new restrictions on 4.5million people living in Greater Manchester and parts of Lancashire and Yorkshire to curb spiralling coronavirus rates.  Meanwhile, Leicester has been in its local lockdown for more than a month after becoming the first region to be hit with the regional restrictions.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599433/Coronavirus-cases-continued-fall-lockdown-measures-eased-June.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,9aff052d45c1a3cecf34ae8e524d105b42c31b57f79027a55a1190d03568b3e2,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Detail, real name Noel Christopher Fisher, was held on nearly $6.3 million bail, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.  The 41-year-old producer was charged on July 31 with 15 counts of sexual assault and five counts of felony assault, the statement said. He is accused of crimes between 2010 and 2018.  Detail, whose real name is Noel Christopher Fisher, was charged on July 31 with 15 counts of sexual assault and five counts of felony assault  Detectives submitted the case to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office in January, the statement said. It didn't provide other details.  'Mr. Fisher was just arrested some hours ago and I have not had an opportunity to speak to him or look at the charges. I am quite certain he will enter a not guilty plea and contest to the fullest all of these allegations,' his attorney, Irwin Mark Bledstein, said in an email late Wednesday night.  Detail won a Grammy in 2015 for co-writing the Beyonce and Jay-Z hit 'Drunk in Love' and has also produced hits for Lil Wayne, Nicki Minaj and Wiz Khalifa.  Detail's other hits include 'Sexy Can I' by Ray J, 'I'm So Paid' by Akon, 'How to Love' by Lil Wayne, '711' by Beyonce and 'We Dem Boyz' by Wiz Khalifa  Last year, a model and aspiring singer was awarded $15 million in a Los Angeles lawsuit that accused the producer of abusing and raping her.  A Los Angeles Superior Court ruled in favor of Kristina Buch who alleged Fisher raped her repeatedly and verbally abused her while acting as her mentor.  Detail is best known for producing Beyonce's Grammy-winning 'Drunk in Love'  In the months following the lawsuit, neither Fisher nor his attorney's responded to summons or filled any documents to argue against the claims.  Thus, allowing Buch to win the lawsuit by default.  According to the lawsuit obtained by Billboard, Buch met Fisher at a recording studio in December of 2016 after she moved from Indiana to Los Angeles to work as a model.  Buch says Fisher agreed to help launch her music career, but instances of violent sexual abuse began to happen soon after.  The lawsuit says Fisher committed various criminal acts, including sexual harassment, sexual battery, assault, gender violence and intentional infliction of emotional distress .  Fisher allegedly became, 'controlling and verbally abusive toward Buch, telling her that she needed to have sex with him and others to get ahead in the music industry' and called her a 'dumb white b****'.  The lawsuit also alleged Fisher 'viciously and violently' raped Buch on seven occasions, with two taking place in front of other people.  During one incident, Buch alleges Fisher told another victim, Peyton Ackley, to record the sexual assault.  Buch is one of six women who have publicly accused Fisher of similar allegations.  After Buch and Ackley's allegations became public in 2018, singers Bebe Rexha and Jessie Reyez claimed that Fisher had tried to inappropriately approach them.  Singers Jessie Reyez (left) and Bebe Rexha (right) have both previously said Fisher tried to inappropriately approach them  Bebe Rexha said: 'He tried to do the same thing to me when I was new artist. Glad these women came out. It's scary. He tried to with me, but I literally ran out of that studio. Karma is a b****' (pictured: Rexha performs on the runway during the 2018 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show at Pier 94 on November 8, 2018 in New York City)  Six other women have spoken out publicly accused Fisher (pictured) of abuse, including two former assistants  Jessie Reyez tweeted at the time: 'One night, over 6 years ago Noel 'Detail' Fisher tried this on me. I was lucky and I got out before it got to this. I didn't know what to say or who to tell. I was scared. Fear is a real thing. The girls that came out are brave as hell.'  Bebe Rexha tweeted: 'He tried to do the same thing to me when I was new artist. Glad these women came out. It's scary. He tried to with me, but I literally ran out of that studio. Karma is a b****.'

Adam Walker, 32, from Tennessee has been living openly as a transgender man since coming out in July, 2017 and is a father of two.  Adam admits it has been difficult for his eldest son James, ten, to understand because he remembers his mother, as opposed to Lincoln who was one when he started to transition and is now five.  The surgical technologist has had 'top surgery' which is a procedure to create a male-contoured chest, specifically, a double mastectomy with nipple grafts.  Adam Walker, 32, from Tennessee has been living openly as a transgender man since coming out in July, 2017 and is a father of two (pictured with his son Lincoln, who was one when he started transitioning and is now five)  Adam, pictured now with his son James, ten, who initially struggled to accept his father's new identity after he came out  Adam said: 'I remember telling James, then seven, that I was going to be a boy.  'He said, ""No you're not. You don't have a penis"".  'I didn't go into a lot of detail because of his age. Lincoln, then one, was way too young to understand.  'It took over two years for both of the boys to call me ""Dad,"" I kept correcting them from November 2017 until February 2020.  Adam underwent top surgery - a double mastectomy with nipple graft - in order to get closer to being his true self in 2019  Adam said the only thing he liked about his life prior to his transition were his two pregnancies. Pictured: Pregnant with his younger son Lincoln before transitioning  'Then suddenly Lincoln started saying ""Daddy"" and James copied - after a couple weeks of reinforcement, I was Daddy to him too..  'I hated it when they called me ""Mom"". It was so awkward because people used to stare.  'I am a happier person now and in that respect it has improved my relationship with the boys.  'Lincoln and I have a great relationship. I'm all he has really, so he's attached to me big time.  The father-of-two said his relationship with his two sons has improved tremendously since his transition  Adam pictured recovering from his double mastectomy. Adam, who was disowned by his family, said he was happier than ever  Adam (pictured prior to his transition) said he wants his boys to know about the different genders, sexuality and acceptance  'I think me deciding to transition put a strain on my relationship with James, but I think he'd agree that he'd rather have a happy dad than a dead mom.  'Living a lie is not worth living and I hope this teaches my boys that. I also reinforce that I will love them and be here for them no matter what they tell me.  'I encourage both boys to be whoever they want to be.  'I grew up so isolated and I want my boys to know different genders, sexuality, and most of all acceptance.  'I am still a human being with feelings and I'm just trying to raise my boys right!'  Adam with James during his pregnancy with Lincoln. The father-of-two explained he came out as a lesbian before realising he was a man  Adam said he used to despise everything 'girly' in his past life. He also felt 'gross' as female and realised he was transgender thanks to a lesbian relationship (pictured during pregnancy with Lincoln)  Adam recalls despising everything 'girly' but adored being pregnant.  He grew up in a strict religious family and homosexuality was taught to be a sin - Adam felt ashamed of his desire to be a male but was unable to speak out.  He felt 'gross' as a female but says being in a lesbian relationship made him realise he is transgender.  He started wearing male clothing and boxers in 2016 which is when his journey truly began.  Adam adds: 'I distinctly remember around the age of seven, I wanted to stand to pee so bad that I took a funnel and used that.  Adam as a child. He explained he had unconsciously wanted to be a man for all his life, but started his transition journey in 2017  James and Adam at school. The father-of-two recalled his son, then seven, struggled to understand his new identity  'I hated dresses, long hair, and anything girly really.  'I had the shirtless poster of Usher on my bedroom walls as a kid, but I idolised his body.  'Despite having relationships with men before, I was never attracted to men, which is when I began to feel like something was wrong with me.

The boys at school! Adam explained that even though he had been with men - which resulted in his two pregnancies - he had never felt attracted to men  Adam before his transition when he was 16. Even though Adam explained he trully felt attracted to women, he did not 'feel like a lesbian'  'I knew my attraction to women was true but I didn't actually feel like a lesbian. I wanted a penis more than anything.  'I had a whirlwind relationship with a woman for three months and it felt right.  'She brought up the idea of me being a male and I didn't immediately dismiss it, but said that I would never transition because of the boys.  'She asked what my name would be and I just blurted out Adam.  Adam's body before his top surgery. The father-of-two began taking hormones in 2017 after starting to wear boxers and male clothing the year before  Adam said he felt much better after undergoing the double mastectomy. The father hails from a conservative town and lost friends and family due to his transition  'A few months later in July 2017, I began taking testosterone.'  Adam has since lost friends and family members since coming out but insists he is happier.  He said: 'I was forced to tell my colleagues as my voice was changing and I couldn't say I was sick for much longer.  'I live in a small conservative town so I was the first trans person they knew of.  'It was hard for my co-workers, whom known me for six plus years, to start calling me Adam and use the he pronouns.

Gender Affirming Surgery (GAS), also known as Sex Reassignment Surgery (SRS) refers to the surgical procedure transgender people undertake to modify their appearance in order to suit the gender they identify with. GAS is a form of treatment to Gender Dysphoria, a condition where a person experiences discomfort or distress because there's a mismatch between their biological sex and gender identity. Adults aged 17 and over can consent to going through these surgeries after undergoing therapy and living in their preferred gender for a year prior to the procedures. Several procedures exist for both transgender men and women, as well as hormone therapy. Masculinization surgeries may include: - a bilateral mastectomy (removal of both breasts) - a hysterectomy (removal of the womb) - a salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries) - phalloplasty or metoidioplasty (construction of a penis) - scrotoplasty (construction of a scrotum) - and testicular implants a penile implant For trans women, surgery may involve: - an orchidectomy (removal of the testes) - a penectomy (removal of the penis) - vaginoplasty (construction of a vagina) - vulvoplasty (construction of the vulva) - clitoroplasty (construction of a clitoris with sensation) - breast implants facial feminization surgery (surgery to make your face a more feminine shape) Source: NHS.uk Advertisement  'It has been a tough path but I wouldn't change a thing.

The Japan-based company raked in 106.5 billion yen ($1billion) for the three months to June, which was more than a six-fold increase from 16.6 billion yen ($157million) over the same period last year, it said on Thursday.  The gaming sector has been a rare beneficiary of coronavirus lockdowns that have driven demand - despite the global health crisis having devastating economic consequences for other industries.  Nintendo has reported a bumper $1billion net profit in the first quarter after the coronavirus lockdown drove demand  Nintendo's sales more than doubled to 358 billion yen ($3.3billion) as demand for its popular Switch console showed no sign of dying down as the device entered the crucial fourth year since its launch.  'Sales for the entire Nintendo Switch family rose 166.6 per cent year-on-year to 5.68 million units,' the firm said, referring to both the original Switch and the stripped-back Switch Lite.  Earlier, Bloomberg News reported that the firm is raising its target for Switch production to around 25 million units this fiscal year from 22 million set in April in order to meet robust demand.  The results far exceed the expectations of analysts and come on the back of runaway success by the Switch and Nintendo's hit Animal Crossing game.  The results far exceed the expectations of analysts and come on the back of runaway success by the Switch and Nintendo's hit Animal Crossing game (pictured on screen at a store in Tokyo)  The leisurely game has struck a chord with players around the world with many enjoying a virtual release from the restrictions on movement and social activity imposed to contain coronavirus.  Nintendo is one of a 'handful' of major companies seeing significant business opportunities from the coronavirus outbreak, analysts said.  Shares of the Kyoto-based company have surged more than 35 per cent since early March and closed up 0.18 per cent on Thursday before its earnings announcement.  'Demand for video games has remained strong among people staying home following the pandemic,' Hideki Yasuda, an analyst at Ace Research Institute in Tokyo, said ahead of the results.  'The lockdown boom is expected to continue for now,' he added.  Since the Nintendo Switch hit stores in March 2017, the gadget has become a huge global seller, helped by innovative, family-friendly titles that have wowed critics and gamers alike (Switch games pictured in store in Tokyo)  Despite the blockbuster figures, the firm declined to upgrade its full-year forecast, leaving intact its projection of 200 billion in net profit for the fiscal year to March, down 23 per cent from the previous year.  Yasuda said the popularity of the latest Animal Crossing title should continue to drive profits for the current fiscal year.  But he cautioned that despite this, 'it is still too early to judge Nintendo's performance as its earnings rely heavily on results from the year-end Christmas season'.  The explosive growth in Switch sales appears to buck a trend that has seen many consoles lose popularity around three years after their launch.  Since it hit stores in March 2017, the gadget has become a huge global seller, helped by innovative, family-friendly titles that have wowed critics and gamers alike.  Nintendo has not entirely escaped the effects of the pandemic and acknowledged that the virus has 'created some difficulties in procuring the parts required for the manufacture of Nintendo Switch consoles'.

Try a youth hostel in the Peak District, known as the English Alps","Advertisement  Hereâs a useful little secret for you: Britainâs youth hostels are open for business. Theyâre cheap, located in beautiful areas and have taken Covid precautions. And best of all, they have vacancies.  I stumbled across this information two weeks back. After foreign holidays hit the wall and every B&B in Britain sold out a few minutes later, I feared my family and I would be going nowhere this year.  On a whim, I Googled the Youth Hostel Association (YHA) and found a clutch of lovely hostels nestled in the verdant heart of the Peak District, most of which were set in historic buildings, and all of which were available.  YHA Hartington, a beautiful and historic building tucked away among the Peaks, is accessible to all for very affordable rates  The Peak District, described by Enlightenment philosopher Thomas Hobbes as 'the English Alps', boasts some of Britain's most beautiful landscapes. Pictured is the River Dove, which runs through stunning ravines  YHA Hartington - a 17th-century manor house that claims to have once hosted Bonnie Prince Charlie - is a jewel in the youth hostel crown  Apart from safety measures â the communal areas are closed and dorms had been converted into single-family rooms â they were up and running almost as normal, according to the website.  And although a youth hostel isnât quite the same without a game of chess with random German hikers of an evening, the list of Covid safety measures was actually quite reassuring.  Better still, they were hugely affordable, with five-person rooms going for as little as Â£39 per room per night. Yes, you read that right. And at the time of writing, there are still vacancies.  The stunning interior of YHA Castleton, a refurbished Gothic mansion set in 27 acres of parkland in the very bosom of the Peak District National Park  The entrance to YHA Castleton. Because of the pandemic, each room there has been allocated its own bathroom as standard  The accommodation at YHA Castleton, says Jake, was 'clean but basic, with metal bunk beds, thin pillows and bed linen in racing green'  So it was that one bright morning, with the sun shining promisingly and the kids â my 12-year-old daughter and 10-year-old twins â in the back seat, I attempted to top up the oil in the car and fumbled the keys into the maw of the engine.  That little episode, which precipitated a bike ride to the local garage, a temporary oil cap and a Â£20 backhander to a mechanic, added a couple of hours onto our departure time.  Despite this hiccup, the mid-afternoon found us rolling down the driveway of Losehill Hall, or YHA Castleton, a refurbished Gothic mansion set in 27 acres of parkland in the very bosom of the Peak District National Park.  As youâd expect from a hostel, the accommodation was clean but basic: metal bunk beds, thin pillows and bed linen in racing green. But because of the pandemic, each room had been allocated its own bathroom as standard.  Mam Tor (pictured), explains visitpeakdistrict.com, has a number of caverns just below it, such as Treak Cliff Cavern, Blue John Cavern, Speedwell Cavern and Peak Cavern  Hiking up to Mam Tor in the heart of the Peak District, which offers panoramic views  Mam Tor offers sublime views of the Peak District, and is understandably popular with hikers  This bridge forms part of the Monsal Trail, a former railway route now converted for cyclists and walkers  Winnats Pass near Castleton, which runs through a highly photogenic limestone gorge  The Scotsmanâs Pack Country Inn in Hathersage, a fine country pub with top food  The grounds of the hostel were stunning, with the welcome addition of a goat pen and pigsty hidden away in the woodland for the children to discover.  The Peak District has long had a special place in English literary culture. It is thought that Jane Austen wrote Pride and Prejudice in Bakewell, and Charlotte BrontÃ« likely set Jayne Eyre in Hathersage, which she visited.  Even the Enlightenment philosopher Thomas Hobbes, who is not known as a bundle of fun, had a special affection for the region, dubbing it 'th' English Alps'.  He was spot-on. Much of the landscape found in the Peak District has changed little since he coined the term in 1636, and it is nothing short of sublime.  We dined that first evening at the Scotsmanâs Pack Country Inn in Hathersage, a 10-minute drive away, which boasted attentive staff, a secluded beer garden and a lovely tinkling brook outside.  The pub had achieved a good balance of safety and comfort, introducing effective precautions while retaining the character of the place. And the food â hearty fare with a posh twist â was just what the doctor ordered, so to speak.  Next day, we corralled the kids out the door and set off for a 10-mile hike up to nearby Mam Tor, a 1,696ft-high vantage point on the top of a ridge with panoramic views over the Peaks.  Predictably, it was an effort to convince the kids to take on the final steep section of the climb. But after a pensioner proudly pedalled past us on a high-spec mountain bike, they caved in and up we went.  At the summit we feasted on a sumptuous packed lunch, collected earlier from the well-loved Three Roofs CafÃ© in Castleton, which has adapted to coronavirus by introducing a picnic service.  My daughter is intolerant of dairy and her diet was easily catered for by the cafÃ©, as was her sisterâs vegetarianism.  The region forms an 890-mile national park which is Eden for hikers and cyclists  The Three Roofs CafÃ© in Castleton has adapted to coronavirus by introducing a picnic service  After lunch, it was just a short walk to Treak Cliff Cavern. This network of catacombs, which is still a working mine, is located in Castleton, the only place in the world where a semi-precious stone called Blue John is found.  It was an extraordinary thing to admire purple stalagmites and blue-veined rock in cold caves beneath the Derbyshire countryside.  Like the cafÃ©, the family-run mine has risen to the challenges of Covid, developing an app that guides visitors through the caves via their phones, without the need for a human expert.  One of the benefits of youth-hostelling in a national park is that there are often several to choose from, which enables a mini-tour.  We would have liked to have strung several together, travelling between them by bicycle, but the last-minute nature of the trip meant that we had come sans vÃ©los.  So we contented ourselves with one change of scene and a transfer by car. After two nights in Castleton, we packed up and moved to the YHA Hartington Hall, about 20 miles south.  It was well worth it. An unrecognised joy of youth-hostelling is discovering the architectural gems that glitter modestly in the YHA crown.  The landpods in the grounds of YHA Hartington, which have retractable roofs  The Old Original Bakewell Pudding Shop, one of the places claiming to have invented the dish  Pictured left is a tunnel on the Monsal Trail. On the right are some of the extraordinary stalactites found in the catacombs of Treak Cliff Cavern  The famous Bakewell Pudding  Hartington â a 17th-century manor house that claims to have once hosted Bonnie Prince Charlie â is one of these. We stayed in the house itself for the first night, then transferred into a 'landpod', a kind of semi-permanent tent, for the second.  The roof was retractable, meaning that in theory you could sleep under the stars. In practice, this didn't seem a good idea, given the fact that we'd been in and out of raincoats all day. Nevertheless, the landpod introduced a welcome element of fun and adventure. Though I'd recommend keeping your children away from baked beans for a couple of days beforehand (for God's sake, don't repeat our mistake).  The property had the advantage of being located near the jaw-dropping Chatsworth House, otherwise known as Britainâs favourite country house, described by Daniel Defoe in 1726 as a 'wonder of art', and one of the few saving graces of the Peak District, which he inexplicably deplored.  We visited on a blisteringly hot day. The house turned out to be more of a palace, stuffed with works of art spanning 4,000 years, from the ancient Egyptians to Lucian Freud, and offering 25 lavish rooms to explore.  The grounds were equally spectacular. We went for a stroll, enjoying the sprayback from the 300ft Emperor Fountain, cooling ourselves in the 18th-century grotto, and paddling with ice-creams in the imposing, serried cascade.  The following day we got our fix of cycling on the Monsal Trail, a disused railway track that has been converted into an un-hilly walking and biking route, complete with four eerie tunnels.  We hired the bicycles at lovely Hassop Station, which is located right on the trail and also houses a very good cafÃ© and book shop for pre or post-ride meals and drinks.  Last but by no means â by no means! â least, no visit to the region would be complete without sampling a genuine Bakewell pudding, which we accomplished in Bakewell itself.  Forget Mr Kipling. He never existed anyway. In the Peak District there are two things: the Bakewell tart, with its familiar white icing with brown feathered lines, and the Bakewell pudding, which nobody has ever heard of. Both are served with custard.  We tried the dishes at Old Original Bakewell Pudding Shop, which is one of a handful of places that claim to have invented the pudding, after lunch under the wooden beams of its upstairs restaurant.  Lunch, by the way, was hearty and good. I was man enough, or perhaps mad enough, to attempt the house signature dish, the Famous Blacksmith's Skillett.  Bamford Edge, with a view to Ladybower Reservoir. This is one of the many amazing walking areas in the Peak District  This image shows Chrome Hill, also known as the âDragonâs Back' on account of its rugged spine  This mÃ©lange of black pudding, bacon, onions and mushrooms in a peppercorn sauce was not for the faint-hearted. But then, I am not faint-hearted. It was filling, peppery and delicious, and I swabbed the last streaks of sauce with a chip.  When it came, the pudding was brown and dipped, cooked on puff pastry rather than shortcrust. Folklore has it that the dish was invented by accident when a local cook messed up the recipe for a jam tart.  It was pleasant enough. But without wanting to offend Bakewellers (Bakewelites? Bakewelians?), it didn't capture my heart. Not so the tart, which we tried next: if heaven was sticky and almondy and wildly calorific, this would be it.  You must try both, of course, having burnt off sufficient calories on a long hike. But to miss the tart would be unforgivable. Oh, and book your hostel soon. They too are selling like hot cakes.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/travel/escape/article-8589005/Want-minute-staycation-Try-youth-hostel-Peak-District-known-English-Alps.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,4cde4f4c833b19a7a3dd2a6a198e08613e6187a923e85b747f2c58c85badd8d3,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The American Heart Association (AHA), who reviewed the available evidence, now recommend avoiding cannabis to protect the heart.  In a scientific statement, it said smoking cannabis has some of the same harms as tobacco, which is known to be a leading cause of death worldwide.  Research has shown the recreational drug may have health benefits â but smoking cannabis has been linked with a slew of damaging heart problems.  Chemicals inside the drug can cause heart rhythm abnormalities within an hour of smoking, studies show.  The toxins can alter blood pressure, heart rate and trigger inflammation, all of which are underlying culprits of heart disease and strokes.  The AHA warning applied to people who use the drug recreationally, as well as and for medicinal purposes.  Cannabis is bad for the heart and may trigger heart attacks and strokes, doctors have warned  Study author Professor Robert Page, from the University of Colorado, said the review found cannabis has 'the potential to interfere with prescribed medications'.  He added studies have also suggested it may 'trigger cardiovascular conditions or events, such as heart attacks and strokes'.  Professor Page also warned attitudes towards cannabis have changed rapidly', with US states and countries legalising it for medical or recreational use.  He added: 'Health care professionals need a greater understanding of the health implications of cannabis.'  Professor Page and AHA colleagues examined existing research on the connection between cannabis and the heart.  Their findings were published in the AHA journal Circulation.  Dr Rose Marie Robertson, the deputy chief science and medical officer for the AHA, said: 'The AHA recommends that people not smoke or vape any substance, including cannabis products, because of the potential harm to the heart, lungs and blood vessels.'  The statement said the a full understanding of how use of cannabis affects the heart and blood vessels is limited by a lack of adequate research.  THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THC AND CBD Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are both derived from the cannabis plant. Together, they are part of the cannabinoid group of compounds found in hashish, hash oil, and most strains of marijuana. THC is the psychoactive compound responsible for the euphoric, 'high' feeling often associated with marijuana. THC interacts with CB1 receptors in the central nervous system and brain and creates the sensations of euphoria and anxiety. CBD does not fit these receptors well, and actually decreases the effects of THC, and is not psychoactive. CBD is thought to help reduce anxiety and inflammation. Advertisement  The debate around marijuana and its claimed medicinal properties is rife.  But the AHA applied their statement against cannabis to people who use it for both recreational and medicinal purposes.  It added: 'Cannabis may have therapeutic benefits, but few are cardiovascular in nature.'  Medical marijuana is legal in 33 US states and Washington, DC, where it is prescribed for pain management, anxiety and depression.  Washington DC, as well as 11 other US states, have already legalised recreational cannabis use.  Only people with specific conditions are able to get cannabis-based medicine with THC in it in the UK. However, it is difficult to get a prescription.  The most common chemicals in cannabis include THC, the component of the plant that give a 'high', and CBD, which does not produce a 'high' or intoxication.  Existing studies have found that within an hour after cannabis is smoked, THC may cause heart rhythm abnormalities.  These include tachycardia, premature ventricular contractions, atrial fibrillation and ventricular arrythmias.  THC also appears to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the 'flight or fight' response.  It can result in a higher heart rate, greater demand for oxygen from the heart, higher blood pressure while laying down and dysfunction within the walls of the arteries.  On the other hand, studies on CBD found links with reduced heart rate, lower blood pressure, increased vasodilation which helps arteries to open up, lower blood pressure and potentially reduced inflammation.  It's for these same reasons that people chose to use CBD products with the aim of reducing anxiety, depression, chronic pain conditions and more.  CANNABIS: WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS? Cannabis is an illegal Class B drug in the UK, meaning possession could result in a five year prison sentence and those who supply the drug face up to 14 years in jail. However, the drug is still widely used for recreational purposes and can make users feel relaxed and happy. But smoking it - the most common way to consume the drug - can also lead to feelings of panic, anxiety or paranoia. Scientific studies have shown the drug can alleviate depression, anxiety and stress, but heavy use may worsen depression in the long term by reducing the brain's ability to let go of bad memories. It can also contribute to mental health problems among people who already have them, or increase users' risk of psychosis or schizophrenia, according to research. Marijuana can be prescribed for medical uses in more than half of US states, where it is used to combat anxiety, aggression and sleeping problems. Researchers are also looking into whether it could help people with autism,eczema or psoriasis. Cannabis oil containing the psychoactive chemical THC, which is illegal in the UK, is claimed to have cancer-fighting properties, and a host of patients claim to have recovered from the disease by taking the drug. Cannabis-based medicine with THC in it was legalised in the UK in November 2018. However, it is difficult to get a prescription. Very few people in England are likely to get a prescription for medical cannabis. Currently, it is only likely to be prescribed for children and adults with rare, severe forms of epilepsy, and adults with vomiting or nausea caused by chemotherapy. Studies have shown cannabis-based medicine could halve the number of seizures suffered by children with a rare type of epilepsy called Dravet syndrome. Advertisement  Inflammation is an underlying culprit of the narrowing of the arteries that can lead to heart disease and strokes.  Therefore, CBD alone may be beneficial â but the AHA did not say this.  Smoking and inhaling cannabis, regardless of THC content, has been linked with a number of heart problems.  Cardiomyopathy, or heart muscle dysfunction, angina, or chest pain, heart attacks, heart rhythm disturbances, sudden cardiac death and other serious cardiovascular conditions have all been discussed in the scientific literature.  Professor Page said: 'Many consumers and health care professionals don't realise that cannabis smoke contains components similar to tobacco smoke.'  Smoking and inhaling cannabis, regardless of THC content, has been shown to increase blood concentrations of carbon monoxide, a poisonous gas, five-fold.  And blood levels of tar increase three-fold, similar to the effects of inhaling a tobacco cigarette. Tar is a sticky black liquid that is residue from burning tobacco and other plant material, like cannabis.  Chest pain, heart attacks, heart rhythm disturbances and other serious heart conditions are associated with carbon monoxide intoxication, the statement said, whether from tobacco or cannabis.  For anyone with existing heart disease, risks go up.  Smoking cannabis has triggered heart attacks, a higher risk of strokes and heart failure in people with underlying heart disease, studies show.  The review also found cannabis has the potential to interfere with prescribed medications, therefore the AHA urged for a better understanding of the risks among doctors.  Some studies suggest cannabis use, both CBD and THC, may be safe and effective for older populations.  Older adults, although the least likely to use cannabis, often use it to reduce neuropathic pain, improve quality of life and decrease prescription drug use such as opioids.  And it's been reported cannabis can have benefits for patients with age-related diseases, including Parkinson and Alzheimer disease.  Some two million Americans with heart disease currently use marijuana or have used it in the past, according to a recent report in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.  But concern about them using the drug include the potential of how it could interact with other medications including blood thinners, anti-depressants, antipsychotics and statins.  Existing studies on marijuana and the heart are short-term, observational and retrospective studies. This means they can spot a trend, but cannot say for certain there is cause and effect.  There is an 'urgent' need for 'carefully designed, prospective short- and long-term studies regarding cannabis use and cardiovascular safety,' Professor Page said.  However, this could be challenging given that marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug by the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), which limits scientists from studying it.  Professor Page said anyone planning to use marijuana should discuss possible risks with their health professional first.  But if people do choose to use cannabis for whatever reason, it is vital they only use legal cannabis products.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599675/Cannabis-bad-HEART-Doctors-warn-using-drug-trigger-heart-attacks-strokes.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,0ef980e8030b87123c2525b437fe04887a39e1ed40c3822bfc0421ff93ae6810,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Mr Williams went on to lift the whole of his sloping garden by 20 inches in the village named after golfer Jack Nicklaus.

Trump had uploaded a video of an interview he gave to Fox News on Wednesday, in which he claimed children are âalmost immune' to COVID-19.  'The President was stating a fact that children are less susceptible to the coronavirus,' Trump's deputy national press secretary Courtney Parella said in an emailed statement.  'Another day, another display of Silicon Valley's flagrant bias against this President, where the rules are only enforced in one direction. Social media companies are not the arbiters of truth.'  A spokesperson for Trump's campaign also leveled similar accusations of bias against Twitter.  'The Twitter employee who announced why the account was briefly suspended is also Kamala Harrisâs former press secretary. Silicon Valley is hopelessly biased against the President,' the spokesperson said, according to Breaking911.  In the video, Trump said â[Children] have much stronger immune system than [adults],â which the official account for his presidential campaign also tweeted.

Children are unlikely to fall seriously ill with Covid-19 and the risk of them dying from the disease is very low, dozens of studies have shown. Scientists warn children are not immune, however. Anyone can get infected with the virus â technically called SARS-CoV-2. But eight months since the pandemic began in China, doctors around the world are still baffled as to why youngsters appear resistant to the disease. Reasons for their resilience to the disease are still unclear, despite a wave of trials devoted to unraveling the truth on the contentious topic. Evidence shows the coronavirus preys on existing ill health and is most dangerous for the elderly. In comparison, the flu poses a big threat to children. Barely any children have died of Covid-19. Only six under-14s have succumbed to the illness in England and Wales, according to official data. Cambridge University's Sir David Spiegelhalter said their risk was 'unbelievably low', adding: 'I don't think any [group] has been safer in the history of humanity.' Statisticians analysing the outbreak in the UK even say youngsters are more likely to be hit by lightning than be killed by the virus. Cambridge academics say the death rate for under-14s is around 0.00068 per cent â the equivalent of seven deaths for every million cases. London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine researchers found in June that children often escape the disease without any symptoms. Only 21 per cent of infected 10 to 19-year-olds had symptoms. By contrast, the rate of symptoms among over-70s was three times higher. Getting fewer symptoms and milder illness may make children less likely to spread it, other researchers have claimed. But two major studies last week, from China and Germany, concluded that children are capable of transmitting the virus. Some academics believe youngsters are better protected against Covid-19 because they are used to catching other less harmful coronaviruses. This may then teach their immune system to recognise SARS-CoV-2, allowing them to fight off the infection without getting seriously ill. Other experts say their body may be faster to react or their bodies better able to cope with viral infections because they are younger. Advertisement  Twitter said the Team Trump post was 'in violation of the Twitter Rules on COVID-19 misinformation. The account owner will be required to remove the Tweet before they can Tweet again.'  The Trump campaign account was active again late Wednesday after removing the post. Trumpâs personal account also retweeted the video but it was removed after the original post was taken down.  In the video in question, Trump was heard speaking in a phone interview with Fox News in which he argued schools across the nation should be re-opening.  'If you look at children, children are almost â and I would almost say definitely â but almost immune from this disease,' Trump said.  'So few, they've got stronger, hard to believe, I don't know how you feel about it, but they've got much stronger immune systems than we do somehow for this.  'And they don't have a problem, they just don't have a problem,' he added.  A link to Trump's Facebook post now diverts to a page that says, 'This content isn't available right now.'  How likely children are to contract or spread the coronavirus has become a deeply contentious issue in the US, with reopening schools essential to enabling many parents to go back to work.  Trump has been calling for both businesses and schools to reopen as part of a push to revive the US economy, whose health will play a major factor in the coming presidential election.  A growing number of US school districts have opted however against in-person classes come September, opting to remain online-only until the pandemic has abated.  The American Academy of Pediatrics has concluded that children appear to transmit COVID-19 less than adults, and that many schools could re-open in the months ahead provided they take precautions such as social distancing and tracking local transmission rates.  Children are known to be far less likely to fall seriously ill or die from the virus: less than one percent of children who test positive for COVID-19 end up dying, according to a Europe-wide study released in June.  The study authors said the true percentage is likely much lower still, since many children with mild or no symptoms would not have been tested at all.  An analysis by the World Health Organization of 6 million infections between February 24 and July 12 found that the share of children aged five to 14 years was about 4.6 percent.  This is the first time Facebook has removed a Trump post for COVID-19 misinformation, and marks a rare instance in which the company has been willing to censor the president.  Trump has been repeatedly accused of spreading misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic - which has killed more than 156,000 Americans -- including the now-infamous musing that virus victims could perhaps be injected with disinfectant.  After a brief change in tone last month, he recently reverted to medical speculation, criticizing his own top virus expert - and praising an eccentric preacher-doctor touting conspiracy theories.  Facebook has previously applied fact-check labels to Trump's misleading posts about various subjects, including mail-in voting.  The move was followed by Twitter short while after, which announced it has ordered Trump's campaign account to remove a post featuring the same video, banning it from tweeting again until it does so  In a statement, a spokesperson for Facebook said the president's post was removed for violating the social media platform's 'policies around harmful COVID misinformation'  In June, the social media giant took down a series of Trump campaign ads that featured a symbol Nazis used to classify political prisoners during World War II.  Facebook has been fiercely scrutinized on both sides of the partisan divide for its handling of Trump's post.  The Mark Zuckerberg-owned company's refusal to take action on posts in which the president appeared to call for violence against Black Lives Matter protesters sparked outrage among democrats, and helped to inspire the #StopHateForProfit boycott campaign that saw over a thousand companies cease advertising on the site.  Amid the fallout, Zuckerberg said in late June that Facebook will now remove posts that incite violence or attempt to suppress voting â even from political leaders â and that the company will affix labels on posts that violate hate speech or other policies.  Twitter has been much more forceful in its efforts to respond to what it deems to be policy violations from politicians, particularly Trump.  Twitter has applied several warning labels to the president's tweets in recent months, identifying his posts as misleading, including on comments he made about 'fraudulent' mail-in ballots.  The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., was also ordered to delete a misleading tweet by Twitter last month after making misleading claims about hydroxychloroquine. He was later suspended from the platform for 12 hours.  Trump's supporters have accused the likes of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, of harboring a liberal bias and unfairly censoring conservatives.  Several Republican lawmakers made similar complaints to Zuckerberg during a high-profile tech antitrust hearing in Congress last month.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8598215/Facebook-removes-post-Trump-falsely-claiming-children-immune-COVID-19.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,60fa54172b1ab619866dd1001941d4811485c69ace579a067370b395acd7a7ee,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Ocado announced last year that it had cut ties with Waitrose after 19 years â to sign with the middle-class favourite's arch-rivals Marks & Spencer.  About 4,670 M&S products appeared on Ocado's website yesterday, three weeks before the official start of their joint venture on September 1.  In order to stave off a potential exodus, M&S set up an 'Ocado readiness' team and its food development team carried out 42 reviews of its ranges to ensure that it could offer a direct match to Waitrose's products in terms of their flavour, ingredients, price and size, including a near identical vegetarian pizza and dark Seville marmalade.  M&S has launched it's product range on Ocado ahead of the launch of it's new delivery service with Ocado in September, with several items near-identical to rival Waitrose including the garlic, mushroom and spinach pizza (left, M&S and right, Waitrose)  The product development team said that most of its work has been in replicating the larger packets Waitrose offered to cater to weekly shoppers.  In response, M&S now sells large blocks of cheddar and 450g bags of green beans in additional to the 100g bags of microwavable vegetables it typically sells in stores to appeal to solo dinners looking for a quick evening meal.  The product matching had even gone as far as replicating a mushroom, feta and spinach pizza after Ocado's customer data showed it was the best selling Waitrose product and that customers would not be satisfied with the M&S chargrilled vegetables alternative.  Other items listed on the site which are almost identical include a jar of dark Seville marmalade and a pack of 300g organic beef meatballs.  M&S Items listed on the Ocado site yesterday included the brand's garlic and herb chicken breasts (right and pictured, left, Waitrose's offering)  The business has also added 150 organic products and ramped up its vegan ranges.  Many of the M&S products either match Waitrose's price point or cost slightly less than the supermarket's offerings.  M&S has never had a delivery service before but launched their Deliveroo service to help families in lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.  Customers are now able to place orders for M&S products for delivery slots in September using Ocado.  Ocado shoppers will be able to snap up M&S' bramley apple turnovers on the site next month (pictured left, M&S and right, Waitrose's similar offering)  When the deal between M&S and Ocado was announced in February last year, there were questions about how suitable it would be for family weekly shops.  M&S is set to pay Ocado Â£750million for a 50% share of the new venture, when Ocado's deal to supply Waitrose products expires.  The Â£600million cash call on its shareholders will bring its ready meals and other food hall items in a Â£1.5billion deal with Ocado.  But many shoppers were not pleased that Ocado's deal would change amid coronavirus concerns and uncertainty.  M&S are due to deliver their full range through Ocado from September, when the delivery service's deal with Waitrose expires  M&S has launched a series of new products on Ocado as it fends off rival Waitrose ahead of the delivery service launch next month, including a Dark Seville orange marmalade (pictured left, M&S offering, and right, Waitrose's version)  Archie Norman, 66, the chairman of M&S, said that he was prepared for some customers to quit Ocado and switch to Waitrose.  He said: 'There will be some fallout of Waitrose customers for such. Do I think there are some Waitrose products that they really like? Well every brand has some loyalists.'  Mr Norman believes the boom in demand for online deliveries during the pandemic means that there will not have to be such a vicious battle at the start.  He said: 'We would have had to pedal like mad to build up a customer base but now we will have a soft start. We won't have to plaster posters on buses.'  Other Waitrose items copied by M&S included more basic vegetables, including a 300g bag of fine green beans (pictured left, M&S and right Waitrose)  Only 40 of M&S 1,000 food stores offer its full grocery range because the majority of its shops are small Simply Food convenience ranges but will be replacing Waitrose's range of 4,000 on Ocado with 6,000 food items and adding 1,600 clothing items.  Mel Smith, 46, chief executive of Ocado Retail, said she was aware of the challenge M&S faced in getting the range of groceries right.  She said: 'I even had a group of friends, mums in Chiswick, say ""How dare you do this to me"" but now I've won them around, particularly with our work on organic and gluten free ranges and we're 100 per cent sure we have more range than we did before.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8599383/M-S-copies-Waitroses-popular-items-boost-online-food-deliveries.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,bd7946a7e8de1610d1bbf0b0cbb09638fe204e09154fa654ef725c37c8e9624d,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Pictured: the dining room  The large galley kitchen sits between a dining room and breakfast room and boasts a double range cooker and farmhouse style sink  Mr Boyd re-read all Fleming's stories and found vital clues about the character's residence's sought-after location and interior in Moonraker, Thunderball and From Russia with Love.  Bond's creator refers to his home as a 'comfortable flat in a Plane-tree'd square off the King's Road' in Moonraker, Mr Boyd says, before he 'let slip a crucial co-ordinate' in Thunderball.  In the 1961 novel, the ninth in the series, Fleming describes Bond driving out of the square into King's Road and then 'fast up Sloane Street and into the [Hyde] Park.'  This led Mr Boyd to conclude Wellington Square was where Fleming imagined 007's home, an opinion shared by John Pearson in a biography of Bond written in 1973. Here, the exact house number was identified as 30.

Britons in the top 25 per cent of rice consumption are at six per cent increased risk of dying from cardiovascular disease than the bottom quarter, a study found.  The chemical gathers naturally in the crop and has repeatedly been linked to illness, dietary-related cancers and liver disease. In serious cases, it can result in death.  Rice is a staple of diets around the world and is relied upon by millions of people in developing countries to provide valuable calories and nutrients.  Globally, it has been estimated that arsenic in rice is to blame for over 50,000 avoidable premature deaths per year.  Arsenic is a toxic chemical which, in high enough doses, can cause serious health issues. It is found naturally in rice (pictured) and research has now proved that eating lots of rise increases the risk of dying from heart disease by six per cent  Arsenic occurs naturally in the soil and is increased in locations that have used arsenic-based herbicides or water laced with the toxin for irrigation purposes.  Rice is grown under flooded conditions and this draws arsenic out of the soil and into the water, ahead of eventual absorption by the plants.  Rice is particularly vulnerable because arsenic mimics other chemicals the plant absorbed via its root system, allowing the toxin to bypass the plant's defences.  Rice is grown under flooded conditions and this draws arsenic out of the soil and into the water, ahead of eventual absorption by plants. Rice is particularly vulnerable because arsenic mimics other chemicals the plant absorbs via its root system (stock)  Arsenic levels in rice could TRIPLE by 2100 Rising temperatures caused by global warming could cause the amount of arsenic in rice to triple by the end of the century, a new study warns. Scientists at the University of Washington in the US grew rice and replicated various temperatures to mimic growing conditions under various global warming projections. Trials were done at the current normal temperature of 77Â°F (25Â°C) as well as 82Â°F (28Â°C), 87Â°F (30.5Â°C), and 91Â°F (33Â°C) to mimic potential climates by 2100. Plants grown in warmer conditions were found to have higher levels of arsenic throughout the plant - including the grains. Advertisement  Researchers at the universities of Manchester and Salford studied rice consumption in England and Wales and the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases caused by arsenic exposure.  Academics tweaked the data to account for other factors known to contribute to cardiovascular disease, such as obesity, smoking and age.  Professor David Polya from The University of Manchester, co-author of the study, said: 'The study suggests that the highest 25 per cent of rice consumers in England and Wales may plausibly be at greater risks of cardiovascular mortality due to inorganic arsenic exposure compared to the lowest 25 per cent of rice consumers.'  He explains the likely increased risk for the top quartile is around six per cent, and is almost definitely between two and 11 per cent.  The researchers say their study is limited but is inexpensive to conduct and more specialised investigations are needed to confirm any link.  They also say that people should not avoid eating rice all together, as it does offer many health benefits due to its high fibre content.  Instead, people should consider opting for rice varieties which are low in arsenic levels, such as basmati, rather than whole grain.

Dashcam footage from a car behind shows her being dragged 65ft along the road before being ripped to the ground.  Harvey dumps the Ford in Walsall and the victim somehow escapes with just cuts, bruises and scarring.  The woman was able to give police a detailed description of the thug following the terrifying October 6 robbery.  An officer recognised the prolific criminal from her statement and arrested him later that day.  The woman is returning from a church and starts the engine using a remote key when the 49-year-old strikes  The victim picked him out from an ID parade days later and he was charged with robbery.  Harvey, from Wednesbury, pleaded guilty and was jailed for six years at Wolverhampton Crown Court last Thursday.  PC Craig Elliott, of West Midlands Police, said: 'This was absolutely terrifying for the victim and it's just sheer fortune she was not more seriously hurt.'  Serial offender Harvey speeds off in the vehicle despite the woman clinging to the door (pictured)  Harvey, from Wednesbury, pleaded guilty and was jailed for six years at Wolverhampton Crown Court last Thursday  He continued: 'Harvey saw an opportunity and did not care who he hurt along the way.  'It was through local knowledge that an officer was able to identify Harvey as the prime suspect through just the description.  'It shows the value of knowing our communities and Harvey has now lost his freedom for a long time.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599195/West-Bromwich-woman-dragged-road-tries-stop-car-thief-stealing-Ford.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,2cc6b183cb2e8882a3a3c1ac02aebaed470caf5b33311e2e184ee64fb0062473,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Jeremy, 67, was charged by prosecutors in Los Angeles in late June after he was accused by four women of historic sexual assault offenses in West Hollywood.  Within days of his arrest, the LA County Sheriffâs Department received 30 other allegations of forcible rape and groping against the porn star in LA County dating back to 2000, prosecutors said.  Dozens of allegations âranging from misdemeanor sexual battery to rapeâ were also made against Jeremy in various other parts of the country.  A new report in the LA Times recounts six of those alleged victimsâ encounters with Jeremy, who claim he used his fame to prey on them.  Jeremy, 67, was charged by prosecutors in Los Angeles in late June after he was accused by four women of historic sexual assault offenses in West Hollywood  Jeremy - whose full name is Ron Jeremy Hyatt â is currently jailed on a $6.6million bond after pleading not guilty to several sex crime felonies.  The women had not contacted police or previously told their stories publicly before Jeremy's arrest, fearing they would face retribution or that they would not be believed.  Each of their stories shared a common theme, according to the Times: that if Jeremy saw something he wanted, he took it â without hesitation.  Lianne Young told the outlet of the night Jeremy allegedly sneaked up behind her on the Sunset Strip in 2000.  The adult performer, who went by the name âBillie Brittâ, was dressed in a bikini at the former House of Blues during a porn industry Halloween party when she says Jeremy shoved her onto a table and forced himself inside her.  According to Young, the ordeal last only a matter of seconds, as she fought Jeremy off of her. Young, now 45, said at least three other industry execs watched the assault unfold, however none of them reacted.  âPeople were just like, âThatâs Ronâ,â Young said.  Fellow adult entertainer Elle Hell said she was too fearful of Jeremyâs pull in the porn industry to speak out when he reportedly attacked her in Chicago, in 2014.  Elle said she got into a limousine with about 10 other people, including Jeremy, and drove to a bar.  Not long after they arrived, Elle said Jeremy pulled her onto his lap. She tried to get away from him by fleeing to the bathroom but she claims he followed her in.  He then reportedly led her back outside where he forcibly performed oral sex on her. Elle claims that, despite the fact she was crying and repeatedly told Jeremy ânoâ, he persisted before attempting to rape her.  âHe takes his [penis] out, and I remember this vividly, Iâm crying,â she said, adding that Jeremy pressed his penis so hard against her that it left an abrasion on her genitals.  Jeremy is said to have eventually given up and grown angry. He led her back inside the club before handing her a note that read, âYou would cry, I hope ... if I ever leave.â  'You have everyday citizens who are already excusing and validating his sexual assaults because we work in an industry where we are ""whores,""' Elle said.

Fellow adult entertainer Elle Hell (right) said she was too fearful of Jeremyâs pull in the porn industry to speak out when he reportedly attacked her in Chicago, in 2014.  Rumors of Jeremyâs alleged sexual misconduct have circulated in the adult entertainment industry for decades, however they were only thrust into the public eye in the last few years  Alana Evans, president of the Adult Performers Actors Guild, said she was at the same party where Young accused Jeremy of raping her, and says Young told her shortly after the incident happened in the early 2000s.  âHe does things without asking,â Evans said. âThereâs a lot of people who assume because weâre adult actresses that itâs OK to just touch us inappropriately.â  Rumors of Jeremyâs alleged sexual misconduct have circulated in the adult entertainment industry for decades, however they were only thrust into the public eye in the last few years.  The turning point came in 2017, when adult entertainer Ginger Banks compiled a series of allegations against Jeremy during a 10-minute YouTube video.  Months afterward, Rolling Stone published allegations made by a dozen women who said Jeremy either groped them or, as two alleged victims detailed, violently raped them.  Jeremy was expelled from the adult film industry in the bombshell articleâs wake, and was even banned from the Exxxotica Expo and the Adult Video News awards.  Rolling Stone followed that article up last month, with several more groping allegations from women outside the adult entertainment field.  Property Management worker Charity Carson-Hawke told the magazine that she had been friends with Jeremy for years before he allegedly attempted to grope her when she visited him at his hotel on May 4, 2020.  According to Carson-Hawke, they were in his hotel room with a few other people, when Jeremy said he wanted to show her something. She followed him into what she thought was another room, which turned out to be a bathroom.  She says Jeremy then slammed the door behind him, pinned her against a wall and tried to grope her.  âHe was trying to put my hand on his penis,â she alleges. âIâm just like, âWhat the hell are you doing?â Iâm screaming at him and fighting.â  Carson-Hawke says she became entangled in a struggle with Jeremy, until she managed to squeeze out of his grasp and walk out the door.

All serious allegations have been investigated by police and dismissed by judges,â Jeremy said in response to the original 2017 article.  Despite the allegations, Jeremy was invited to join dozens of women at a 2018 birthday celebration for brothel owner and reality TV star Dennis Hof at the Bunny Ranch near Carson City.  During that gathering, Jeremy allegedly sexually assaulted a woman at the party. The woman, who asked to be identified, said she horrified that Jeremy was invited to the party in the first place, considering the nature of the allegation made against him.  Hof, who died 48 later, reportedly introduced several of the women at the party to Jeremy, before taking her hand and placing it onto Jeremyâs penis, without her consent.  The woman said Jeremy led her away from the partygoers and toward the back of the building. She said she tried to mouth âhelp meâ to others at the party but failed to get their attention.  Jeremy allegedly took her outside, pressed her up against a railing and forced himself inside her, she said.  âHe bends me over the railing at the restaurant, lifts up my dress and does his thing,â she told the Times. âIâm in shock. I donât really know how to process whatâs going on because itâs such a public area. What do you do?â  The woman says the attack lasted nearly 15 minutes. âI feel guilty that I didnât scream or anything. I guess I didnât know how to react,â she said.  The woman reported the alleged attack to Banks and a close friend, adult actress Draven Star, the next day. She said she also told staff at the ranch but nothing was done.  Draven, who also worked at Hofâs brother, said the woman looked shell-shocked the following morning after the alleged assault.  âThose words that she told me are burned into my brain. â¦ Thereâs no way she was making any of that up,â Draven said.  âI do porn â¦ she was a cam girl â¦ and itâs Ron Jeremy,â Draven said on the subject of not reporting the incident to police. âSo no. No one is going to take us seriously.â  Messages observed by the Times exchanged the night after the attack show the woman describing the assault in visceral detail and expressing concerns that Jeremy is âdoing this to other womenâ.  âI have never and would never rape anyone. All serious allegations have been investigated by police and dismissed by judges,â Jeremy said in response to the original 2017 article detailing a series of sexual assault and rape allegations  Sabrina Alvarado, who has modeled for playboy and is better known as Marcela Latinbabe said she first met Jeremy at the Exxxotica Expo in New Jersey, in 2015 where he groped her  In court filings made public, Los Angeles prosecutors detailed a number of uncharged allegations against Jeremy, including a 1997 rape allegation, claims he forced oral sex on women in 2006 and 2016, and forcibly raping a woman in 2010.  The Times said a number of the alleged victims they spoke to said Jeremy crossed lines of consent almost immediately upon meeting them.  Sabrina Alvarado, who has modeled for playboy and is better known as Marcela Latinbabe said she first met Jeremy at the Exxxotica Expo in New Jersey, in 2015.  Alvarado said she approached Jeremy to ask for a photo. Immediately, heâs said to have grabbed her breast and put them into his mouth. She provided the outlet with copies of the photos.  Alvarado said she did not give Jeremy permission to touch her and was shaken up by his behavior.  According to Evans, the head of the adult performers union, numerous women have complained of Jeremy running his hands up their skirt and trying to penetrate them without consent.  âHeâs done that to me,â Evans told the Times. âWhen enough women describe something that you have felt, then you know, OK, itâs absolutely real.â  Jeremy maintained his innocence in a statement posted to social media on June, declaring âI am innocent of all charges. I can't wait to prove my innocence in court! Thank you to everyone for all the support'  According to Alana Evans, the head of the adult performers union, numerous women have complained of Jeremy running his hands up their skirt and trying to penetrate them without consent.  Evans says she has performed scenes with Jeremy in the past. During one shoot, she says she witnessed him pulling up the skirt of an actress who was sleeping between scenes.  Colleen Pinto, a former adult film actress and exotic dancer in Florida, said Jeremy grabbed her breasts during an appearance at a strip club in 2005.  When Pinto tried to pull away from Jeremy, she says he smacked her in the breast with a microphone.  âAny of us that were ever dancers or in the porn industry, we all have a Ron story,â the 46-year-old said. âYou donât ever meet Ron without him doing something to you.â  Jeremy - whose full name is Ron Jeremy Hyatt â is currently jailed on a $6.6million bond after pleading not guilty to several sex crime felonies.

Campaigners have even warned some doctors are dismissing many of the symptoms of 'long Covid' as being 'all in their heads'.  The founder of the Long Covid Support Group, Claire Hastie, said the lasting effects of the illness had left her wheelchair-bound.  Another member of the 15,000-strong group, a doctor, revealed that he was unable to walk up one flight of stairs without getting out of breath.  Ms Hastie, who was diagnosed with Covid-19 in March, claimed data from the King's College London symptom tracking app shows that up to 500,000 people in the UK are currently suffering from the long-term effects of Covid-19.  Most coronavirus patients will recover within a fortnight, suffering a fever, cough and losing their sense of smell or taste for several days.  However, evidence is beginning to show that the tell-tale symptoms of the virus can persist for weeks on end in 'long haulers' â the term for patients plagued by lasting complications.  Up to half a million Brits are suffering from psychosis, fatigue and loss of eyesight after recovering from coronavirus, MPs have been told  Nine in 10 coronavirus patients from ICU in Wuhan still suffering serious lung damage A new study has found that the 90 per cent of coronavirus patients treated in intensive care in Wuhan - the place in China where the virus broke out - are still experiencing lung damage. Research (seen by The Times) by the intensive care director at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Peng Zhiyong, found that patients had a lack of energy and couldn't walk far. And almost half of the patients have developed depression because they can't return to normal life. Dr Peng is doing a year-long study following 107 patients who suffered pneumonia and were intubated during the crisis. After three months he found 90 per cent still had lung damage. He also found that about 10 per cent of people had lost the antibody that could fight off the virus. And less than half of the people had managed to return to their jobs. Up to 50 per cent were depressed. Advertisement  Survivors have described feeling like there is a 'slab of concrete' on their chest, and have struggled to complete everyday tasks, such as emptying the dishwasher, without feeling extremely tired.  Previously fit people told the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on coronavirus how their lives had been turned upside down by a horde of lasting symptoms.  Ms Hastie described how she used to cycle 13 miles to work but can no longer walk 13 metres and is now largely confined to a wheelchair with her children providing much of her care.  She said: 'Many people in our group to this day are being told by their GPs that it's caused by anxiety and it's all in their heads.  'It can cause anxiety but it is not caused by anxiety. The science needs to catch up with us.'  Another member of the Facebook support group, an anaesthetist and intensive care doctor, said he was now unable to walk up just one flight of stairs without feeling chest pain and shortness of breath.  Dr Jake Suett said: 'I was doing 12-hour shifts in ICU. It's a high-pressure situation, you have to be able to be active. I was going to the gym three times a week regularly.  'And now a flight of stairs or the food shop is about what I can manage before I have to stop... if I'm on my feet then shortness of breath comes back, chest pain comes back.'  The APPG were also told that an online survey of 1,800 people found that many employees felt pressured to go back to work even though they didn't feel they could while suffering from long-term symptoms.  Pictured is Claire Hastie - founder of the Long Covid Support Group  Ms Hastie said that people in her Facebook group, which now has 15,327 members, have been told they'll never work again.  She gave an example of a Pilates teacher who doesn't know if and when she'll ever be able to work again, adding: 'People are being pressured back by employers who, understandably, don't understand this.'  One Long Covid activist, Robin Gorna, revealed that her three children aged between 11 and 16 had suffered from long-term symptoms and one took four months to recover.  And one member of the APPG, Labour MP Andrew Gwynne, said that he was still suffering from coronavirus symptoms after 18 weeks.  Talya Varga, 27, said the shortness of breath she has experienced since having Covid-19 in April feels like a 'concrete slab on her chest'  NHS will set up 'virtual wards' to treat people with long-term illnesses caused by coronavirus in their own homes Patients recovering from coronavirus will be treated online from their own homes because there is no funding for new rehab clinics, according to health officials. NHS England said rehabilitation will 'largely be provided in existing physical facilities' and in some cases patients will be treated virtually in their own homes. But the Health Service Journal (HSJ) said no capital funding was made available for more facilities - and spaces are currently limited. Instead, a virtual ward - the yourcovidrecovery.nhs.uk website - will be used to treat the majority of people recovering from severe coronavirus symptoms. The Government confirmed a further Â£500 million in revenue funding over the rest of this year for Covid rehab services - meaning health workers' salaries and the costs of existing buildings will be met. But no more buildings can be built, or renovated for the purpose, because capital funding - which is for long term projects - has not been made available. Ruth Ten Hove, director at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, told the HSJ: 'The message we have been given is that people can now do their rehab online (through a new NHS website). 'We were involved in the website and it can get good outcomes. But it's not for everyone and using that alone will widen health inequalities and digital exclusion.' An NHS spokesman said the decision not to allocate capital funding was made because patients can access treatment online. Advertisement  He said that he struggles to ask just one Parliamentary question on Zoom and then is forced to spend the rest of the day in bed.  British scientists have already launched an investigation into the long-term impacts of Covid-19 in search of answers to thousands of people's problems, which has been referred to as 'this generation's polio'.  The Department of Health has announced that up to 10,000 people will be involved in a study to look at how people who catch the coronavirus fare long-term.  Growing evidence suggests that even people who only get mildly sick may suffer long-lasting health effects including lung damage.  The UK's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) has warned that Covid-19 patients could be left with 'extreme tiredness and shortness of breath for several months'.  The study, led by researchers and doctors in Leicester, will look at how people's mental health is affected by illness and whether factors like sex or ethnicity affect how well someone recovers from Covid-19.  Patients in the study, which will receive Â£8.4million in funding, will have medical scans, blood tests and lung samples so experts can look at how they are affected.  It comes as the NHS has announced it's launched a long-term recovery service called 'Your Covid Recovery', which will offer online advice to the public and more specialised physio and mental health support to some patients from this summer.  Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, said: 'As well as the immediate health impacts of the virus it is also important to look at the longer-term impacts on health, which may be significant.  'We have rightly focused on mortality, and what the UK can do straight away to protect lives, but we should also look at how Covid-19 impacts on the health of people after they have recovered from the immediate disease.'  Researchers from Italy have reportedly found that almost 90 per cent of patients discharged from a Rome hospital after recovering from coronavirus were still experiencing at least one symptom two months after coming down with the illness.  The APPG also heard from a group of grieving relatives who have lost family members to coronavirus.  Jo Goodman, who represents a group of 1,450 bereaved family members, is urging the Government to consider a Hillsborough disaster-style inquiry into the handling of the coronavirus response.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599223/Up-half-million-Britons-suffering-effects-long-Covid-MPs-told.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,ba2b579cc20afb334f39e8a41d4dc86a7482d5fd4949478ff0bf8eab74ede206,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The image - verified by MailOnline - shows firefighters trying to prize the lock off a door beneath a sign that reads 'entrance 12', along with signs warning of hazardous chemicals inside.  The person who took the photo has been confirmed dead with the photo found on his phone, while Beirut's governor has said 10 firefighters are missing after the blast, sparked when 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in the warehouse caught fire.  The image was being widely-circulated on Arab-language twitter accounts on Wednesday as people paid tribute to the firefighters, who are assumed to have perished.  An image has surfaced on social media that shows the final moments of a fire crew sent to tackle a blaze at warehouses in Beirut's port, shortly before chemicals stored inside exploded with the force of a small nuke  Video taken of the area around the same time shows fire crews at the scene along with heavy grey sliding doors. Beirut's governor has confirmed that 10 firefighters are missing following the blast  More footage of the burning warehouses taken from the roof of the building opposite shows the same warehouses on fire before they are blown to smithereens  An image of the warehouse taken some time before the blast shows the same sliding doors and white patch - though without writing on it - along with what appear to be the chemicals that exploded stored inside  The image emerged as...  Emmanuel Macron arrived in Lebanon, a former French colony, where he met with President Michel Aoun and visited the disaster site  French rescue teams, who are helping with the recovery, said there is a 'good chance' of finding survivors  Lebanese officials gave an investigating committee just four days to identify the culprits amid widespread anger at the government  Prince Charles and wife Camilla sent a heartfelt letter to the President of Lebanon, offering 'thoughts and special prayers at this desperately sad time'  Britain sent a Royal Navy ship to Beirut to help the city recover, along with a Â£5million humanitarian aid package and search and rescue teams  It was revealed that the warehouse was investigated as recently as December last year after a strange odor began coming from it, with a report concluding the 'dangerous' chemicals should be moved  Beirut Gov. Marwan Abboud said losses from the blast are estimated at up to $15billion  Details from the image - such as the heavy grey sliding doors and white sign with Arabic writing - were also visible in a video taken outside the flaming warehouses as a fire, thought to have been sparked by a welder, took hold.  The video shows firefighters in similar uniforms to those seen in the photo as they assess the scene, seemingly unaware of the danger.  More footage taken from the roof of a building across the street shows identical warehouse buildings being consumed by smoke and flames, along with similar-looking signs on the warehouse doors.  That footage can be verified as genuine because it features a large metal support strut, that can be seen on the roof of a building opposite the warehouse in Google Satellite images.  Meanwhile a photo taken of the warehouse some time ago shows the same grey sliding doors, high square windows and white sign, though without an writing on it. That photo also purports to show sacks filled with ammonium nitrate that caused the explosion.  The second video also features other corroborating details seen in multiple pieces of footage from around Beirut, such as small explosions from what appear to be fireworks moments before the main blast takes place.  That video also features the moment the blast happens, obliterating the warehouse, badly damaging grain silos opposite, and sending out a shockwave that flattened nearby buildings and blew out windows across the city.  2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored within the burning warehouse exploded shortly after the images and footage were taken, leaving behind little more than a watery hole in the ground  The blast sent out a shockwave that pulverized nearby warehouses (pictured), shredded the interior of nearby buildings, and blew out glass panes across the city  An aerial image showing the devastation caused to Beirut's port by the blast, with costs estimated at up to $5billion  The blast almost completely destroyed the port along with a grain silo (pictured centre), which were an economic lifeline for Lebanon which was already suffering through an economic crisis  At least 5,000 people were wounded in the explosion which also left 300,000 homeless and caused damage estimated at up to $5billion, with half of Beirut's buildings affected.  The blast threatens to reignite anti-government protests in Lebanon that have been ongoing since last year amid allegations of entrenched incompetence and corruption.  Emmanuel Macron offered France's support for the Lebanese people as he visited Beirut on Thursday, but warned the country would 'continue to sink' unless its leaders carry out reforms.  France has long sought to support its former colony and has sent emergency aid since the blast, but is worried about endemic corruption and has pressed for reforms as a financial crisis deepened in the Middle East country.  IRAQ TAKES STOCK OF CHEMICALS AFTER BEIRUT BLAST Iraq announced Thursday it will create an inventory of all hazardous materials at ports and airports after the ignition of ammonium nitrate fertiliser at a portside warehouse levelled swathes of Beirut. An emergency committee chaired by the head of Iraq's border agency said it had been tasked with carrying out the work and had given itself 72 hours to complete it. The goal was to 'avoid any repetition of what happened in Lebanon' in Iraq, the panel said. Lebanon's government, already seen as incompetent and corrupt, is now facing renewed protests as anger turns on politicians for failing to store the explosive chemicals properly. Iraq has also seen mass protests over the past year against a political system based on confessional quotas that is seen as corrupt and incompetent. The searing summer heat in Iraq makes it even more vulnerable to the danger of accidental explosions of poorly stored hazardous materials. The accidental ignition of munitions stocked in residential areas has caused deadly explosions in Iraq in the past. Advertisement  After landing in Beirut, Macron said France's solidarity with the Lebanese people was unconditional, but said he wanted to tell some 'home truths' to political figures.  'Beyond the blast, we know the crisis here is serious, it involves the historic responsibility of leaders in place,' Macron told reporters.  'We can't do without telling each other some home truths,' he added. 'If reforms are not carried out, Lebanon will continue to sink.'  Lebanon has placed every official responsible for the security of Beirut's port for the last six years under house arrest as it investigates a massive explosion which has devastated the city.  The country's political leaders vowed those responsible for the tragedy would 'pay the price', but customs officials pointed the finger of blame back at them - saying they were repeatedly warned of the danger but failed to act.  The dangerous load is understood to have been abandoned by Russian businessman Igor Grechushkin in September 2013 before eventually being transferred to the port where it remained for six years.  A ship carrying the load was detained en route from Batumi, in the ex-Soviet republic Georgia, to Mozambique, and never recovered.  On Tuesday evening a fire that started in Warehouse 9 before spreading to Warehouse 12, where the chemicals were being stored, igniting them and causing the blast.  Raghida Dergham of the Beirut Institute yesterday said: 'Storing Ammonium Nitrate in a civilian port is a crime against humanity that must not go unpunished.  'Condemnations are not enough. I'm safe but devastated. I lost friends. I lost my apartment. Had I been home, I would have lost my life.'  An official source familiar with preliminary investigations blamed the incident on negligence. Lebanese citizens directed anger at politicians who have overseen decades of state corruption and bad governance that plunged the nation into financial crisis.  Director General of Lebanese Customs Badri Daher said the country's judiciary was told six times about the hazardous chemicals stored in a warehouse in the Lebanese capital.  Customs officials are understood to have asked authorities to move the dangerous substance from Hangar 12 due to the danger they believe it posed to the city and given to the army or sold to an explosives company.  'We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why,' Daher said.  Another source close to a port employee said a team that inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago warned that if it was not moved it would 'blow up all of Beirut'.  Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed those responsible will 'pay the price' as he declared a two-week state of emergency to deal with the crisis, urging all world leaders and 'friends of Lebanon' to donate aid to the country, adding: 'We are witnessing a real catastrophe.'  A view of the destroyed grain silo is visible through a blown-out window close to Beirut's port on Wednesday  Destroyed warehouses are seen near the port area in the aftermath of a massive explosion in downtown Beirut  Workers remove rubble from damaged buildings near the site of an explosion which brought devastation to central Beirut  People pick their way through the remains of their destroyed office building after a massive explosion in Beirut  Emmanuel Macron arrived in Lebanon, a former French colony, where he met with President Michel Aoun (right) and was taken to the bomb site where French rescue crews are helping the recovery effort  Documents published online suggested it could be given to the army or sold to an explosives company, but did not receive any replies, leaving the explosive cargo languishing in the now destroyed port area of the capital.  Ammonium nitrate is a chemical used in fertiliser bombs and is widely used by the construction industry but also by insurgent groups such as the Taliban and the IRA for improvised explosives.  Authorities have cordoned off the port itself, where the blast left a crater 200 meters (yards) across and shredded a large grain silo, emptying its contents into the rubble. Estimates suggested about 85 per cent of the country's grain was stored there.  Lebanon is highly dependent on imports, and the destruction of the port, along with the worsening cash crisis, have raised fears of shortages.

The simple gadget dramatically improves the wearer's ability to learn new words, say the University of Pittsburgh team behind the research new development.  The painless technique called tVNS (transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation) may also be applied to other forms of education beyond learning a new language.  Electrical currents are sent through the ear and led to English speakers distinguishing Mandarin sounds more easily - and picked up some twice as quickly.  It was achieved through precisely timed stimulation of the vagus nerve - the longest of the 12 cranial nerves connecting the brain to the rest of the body.  The simple gadget dramatically improves the wearer's ability to learn new words, say the University of Pittsburgh team behind the research new development  The painless technique called tVNS (transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation) may also be applied to other forms of education beyond learning a new language  Lead author Dr Fernando Llanos, of the University of Pittsburgh, said this discovery opens the door to improving cognitive performance for a range of areas.  Mandarin is considered one of the hardest languages to learn, the authors said, due to distinctive changes in pitch, called 'tones' that change the meaning of words that would otherwise sound the same.  Senior author Dr Matthew Leonard, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, said this was one of the first demonstrations that a non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation can enhance a complex cognitive skill.  The device is placed in the outer ear and activates the nerve using unnoticeable pulses to stimulate one of its nearby branches.  In the study 36 participants were trained to identify the four tones of Mandarin Chinese in examples of natural speech.  The 18 who received tVNS showed quick improvements in the two easiest tones.  By the end they were 13 per cent better on average than those not receiving tVNS and reached peak performance twice as fast.  This was compared to the other half who acted as controls who wore the device - but never received stimulation.  Co author Bharath Chandrasekaran, said: 'There is a general feeling people can't learn the sound patterns of a new language in adulthood, but our work historically has shown that's not true for everyone.  'In this study, we are seeing that tVNS reduces those individual differences more than any other intervention I've seen.'  It may level the playing field for those who find learning languages particularly hard.  'In general, people tend to get discouraged by how hard language learning can be, but if you could give someone 13 per cent to 15 per cent better results after their first session, maybe they'd be more likely to want to continue,' said Leonard.  Electrical currents are sent through the ear and led to English speakers distinguishing Mandarin sounds more easily - and picked up some twice as quickly  The researchers are now testing whether longer training sessions can impact on the ability to discriminate the two hardest tones which weren't particularly well improved during the original study.  Stimulation of the vagus nerve has been used to treat epilepsy for decades.  It has recently been linked to benefits for a wide range of issues ranging from depression to inflammatory disease but the reasons remain unclear, authors said.  Most of these findings have used invasive forms of stimulation involving an impulse generator implanted in the chest.  By contrast, the ability to evoke significant boosts to learning using simple, non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation could lead to significantly cheaper and safer clinical and commercial applications.  The researchers suspect tVNS boosts learning by broadly enhancing neurotransmitter signaling.  Chandrasekaran said they were showing robust learning effects in a completely non-invasive and safe way - making the technology scalable to a range of consumer and medical uses such as rehabilitation after a stroke.  'Our next step is to understand the underlying neural mechanism and establish the ideal set of stimulation parameters that could maximize brain plasticity.'  'We view tVNS as a potent tool that could enhance rehabilitation in individuals with brain damage.'  The findings of the study have been published in the journal Science of Learning.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8599957/Earbud-like-device-claims-boost-linguistic-skills-zapping-ear.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,c2147cf437a4378c56bd6470852f981bf94e6a85e8075506d43f9690ba858682,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The dramatic shake-up - billed as the biggest since the Second World War - vows to slash red tape and fast-track developments, while insisting they must be 'beautiful'.  Computers could be used to screen applications so 'binary' issues can be decided automatically.  It would also strip local councillors of power to decide on individual projects to overcome blocking, and impose binding central targets to force local authorities to allocate land for homebuilding.  The blueprint has been heavily criticised by charities, planning officers and architects who warned they could lead to a 'generation of slums' and kill off affordable housing projects.  But in a round of interviews this morning, Mr Jenrick dismissed the criticism as 'complete nonsense'.  Speaking on Sky News, Mr Jenrick said: 'Today it takes seven years to produce a local plan, we want to reduce that to around two and a half years.  'And it can take five years to get spades in the ground on a housing estate. We believe that can be cut very significantly and everybody will benefit from that - the people who work in the industry and those people who want to get on the housing ladder as well.'  Asked whether the public will have less of a say on planning decisions, he added: 'Well we want to have a meaningful local engagement and that is at the planning making stage. So what our proposals will do, it will mean that when the plan is being produced, there will be a really serious debate in a local community about where they want homes to be built.'  Under the plans, every area in England will be designated for either 'growth', 'renewal' or 'protection'. In growth areas individual developments will not require planning permission, so the default position will be that homes can be built  In a round of interviews this morning, Robert Jenrick dismissed claims his planning overhaul could lead to 'slums' as 'complete nonsense'  Mr Jenrick also took aim at the Royal Institute of British Architects' description of the proposals as 'shameful'.  'That I'm afraid is complete nonsense. I saw those comments and they were put out before we'd even published the document.'  The proposals include fast-tracking approvals of housing projects that are 'in keeping with local character and design'.  Developers will be able to skip stages of the planning process if buildings are based on designs in official pattern books drawn up by local authorities.  There will also be a requirement for all new streets to be tree-lined unless there are exceptional circumstances.  Under the plans, every area in England will be designated for either 'growth', 'renewal' or 'protection'. In growth areas individual developments will not require planning permission, so the default position will be that homes can be built.  Renewal areas will have 'permission in principle' to build, but all developments will have to be approved. In protected areas such as green belt land, most new developments will be banned.  There will also be a requirement for all new streets to be tree-lined unless there are exceptional circumstances. Pictured, a row of newly built houses in central Scotland  Local councillors will be stripped of power to decide on individual developments in an attempt to get the country building. Pictured, an unfinished housing estate in Bordon, Hampshire  Local councils will decide how to designate all the land in their area. All planning applications will be registered online via an interactive map, intended to help local residents participate in decision making.  However, there are concerns that those living in 'growth' areas could be confronted with huge new developments they will get little say over.  Planning shake-up to get homes built Local councils will be given two and a half years to draw up plans for building more homes or will face sanctions. Developments that follow locally-agreed pattern books on home design will be fast-tracked, with a requirement for tree-lined streets in all new schemes. Every piece of land in England will be designated as for 'growth', 'renewal' or 'protection'. Residents will be able to access online maps and data to see what is planned in their local communities. Advertisement  As part of the overhaul all councils will be given two-and-a-half years to draw up plans for the building of more homes or will face sanctions that are yet to be decided.  In what is likely to be a particularly controversial move, there will be a 'standard requirement' for local authorities to provide land for new homes.  Central government will decide how to 'distribute' the 300,000 a year national housebuilding target.  The White Paper suggests making all the rules 'machine-readable'.  'We want to move to a position where all development management policies and code requirements, at national, local and neighbourhood level, are written in a machine-readable format so that wherever feasible, they can be used by digital services to automatically screen developments and help identify where they align with policies and/or codes,' the proposals state.  'This will significantly increase clarity for those wishing to bring forward development, enabling automation of more binary considerations and allowing for a greater focus on those areas where there is likely to be greater subjectivity.'  The document adds: 'This will help automate routine processes, such as knowing whether new applications are within the rules, which will support faster and more certain decision-making.'  The Town and Country Planning Association (TCPA) condemned it as disruptive and rushed, saying there are currently up to 1million unbuilt permissions.  Alan Jones, president of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) described the proposals as 'shameful', adding 'there's every chance they could also lead to the development of the next generation of slum housing.'  The Government insisted that there would be no lowering of building standards as a result.  Mr Jenrick also said the changes would provide a 'major boost for small building companies across the country' by making it easier for them to navigate through the planning process.  Thirty years ago small builders were responsible for 40 per cent of new build homes compared with 12 per cent today.  Mr Jenrick will also replace the community infrastructure levy used by councils to secure money from developers to pay for amenities such a new roads with a standard national levy.  But campaigners voiced concerns about how much say residents would have about developments.  Tom Fyans of the Campaign to Protect Rural England said: 'The key acid test for the planning reforms is community involvement and it's still not clear how this will work under a zoning system.  'We also need robust legal guarantees that the public are consulted regarding new development.'  Nikki Williams of The Wildlife Trusts said: 'It's critical that government weaves nature into the heart of every housing development. Proposals for 'tree-lined streets' are nothing like enough.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599377/Robert-Jenrick-denies-planning-revolution-create-slums-hit-government-targets.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,c6010941fc67be603fd1a9e6523e033cbae3cd709bd3d2691035a7ce35cace51,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Last month Islington Council approved plans to build a two-storey extension on a building near Oliver's HQ, which is also home to the Naked Chef's cookery school.  Raising a complaint on the 45-year-old's behalf, Rob Harrington, facilities manager at the headquarters in Islington, said: 'You can imagine (privacy) is not something Jamie has much of outside of his home and workspace.'  Councillor Gulcin Ozdemir said the celebrity chef's needs should not be prioritised over new homes in the North London borough, which currently has 14,000 people waiting for social housing.  Essex-born Oliver had complained the extension would raise noise levels during construction and block lighting to his base, which he uses for filming.  Councillor Jenny Kay told a planning committee last month: 'Construction noise and nuisance isnât something that can stop development.'  Jamie Oliver raised concerns that six extra homes being built next to his North London HQ could disrupt him filming due to light restrictions and loud noise during development  Jamie Oliver Group occupies about 1,845sq.m of floor space at the building, having moved there in 2017.  There are eight years left to run on the lease on the building.  Mr Harrington told Islington Council's Zoom planning conference call: 'The proposal will impact our business greatly through the construction phase and subsequently if the development is approved.  'A key driver for us moving to the area in 2017 was the fantastic space with its privacy and natural light the building offered.'  Mr Harrington added: 'This will not only commercially hit our capacity to work effectively but it will also impact Jamie and our staff's privacy, which as you can imagine is not something Jamie has much of outside of his home and workspace.'  He also said the new homes could impact on filming and photography work at Jamie Oliver's offices, by blocking out natural light.  Other businesses - including a film studio - based in the building have also opposed the scheme saying it would cause too much noise and disruption.  But Islington Council planners approved the scheme after finding it was in line with minimum distance rules from the celeb chef's office.  According to the Islington Tribune, Committee chairwoman Councillor Jenny Kay told the meeting on July 14: 'I think that all of us want to protect independent business in the area especially at a time like this, but we know that construction noise and nuisance isnât something that can stop development.'  Speaking for the applicant, Clearwell Creek Properties Ltd, Greg Dowden said the developers had worked 'very hard' with adjoining occupants to make sure they had the best possible scheme.  Islington Council approved plans to add a two-storey extension to this building last July, despite concerns from Jamie Oliver over noise, privacy and it blocking light to his headquarters  After the meeting, Islington Labour councillor Gulcin Ozdemir tweeted: 'Do I support individual business? Yes.  'Do I think a celebrity chef's needs should be prioritised over providing six new homes that is not even going to make a dent to the 14,000 on Islington's waiting list?  'I don't!'  Mr Oliver's business woes have continued with much of his once robust empire now crumbling.  His Jamie's Italian brand went bust alongside restaurants Fifteen and Barbecoa.  He was forced to close all but three of his 25 UK restaurants last year after the business called in administrators, with 1,000 people losing their jobs.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599247/Jamie-Oliver-loses-battle-stop-six-new-homes-built-London-HQ.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,9b9a589c4bc9d76e881981142af6a382030328f0bc266aee8a0b84ed175dfa01,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Researchers calculated that 41million people worldwide are currently living with the agonising form of arthritis each year.  It means cases have risen by 7 per cent since 1990 â but the increase is around 11 per cent in Western Europe and up to 34 per cent in the US and Canada.  Experts at the University of Sydney, who carried out the review, described the pace of increase as 'astonishing'.  Gout has been traditionally associated with living a luxurious lifestyle, and can be caused by over-indulging in beer and red meat.  But evidence is beginning to show the inflammatory condition - which causes sudden pain, tenderness and swelling of joints - is largely driven by genetics.  Cases of gout are rising at an 'alarming' rate with more than 41 million people struck down globally by the painful condition every year, warns a new study.  Its famous sufferers include Henry VIII, with the Tudor monarch being the reason gout is known as the 'disease of kings'.  And Benjamin Franklin, one of the founding fathers of the US, is said to have missed many meetings to draft the Declaration of Independence due to gout.  Gout â which is more common in men â affects around one in 40 people in the UK and a total of 8.3million people in the US.  Symptoms, including severe sudden joint pain and swollen skin in the affected area, occur due to the formation of uric acid crystals in the joints.  Dr Emma Smith, senior author of the study, said the burden of gout was generally highest in developed regions and countries.  The team calculated there was around 7.4million new cases of the disease each year â around 92 new cases for every 100,000 people.  Writing in the journal Arthritis and Rheumatology, the academics said this was a 5.5 per cent rise on 1990.  But they said that rates were rising quickest in high-income North America (26.9 per cent).  Dr Smith and colleagues adjusted all of their findings for age, meaning the ageing population could not skew the results.  The experts wrote: 'The increasing trend of gout burden is most likely to continue as the global aging population is on the rise.  'Attempts to lessen the disease onset and future burden require better awareness, especially of risk factors, and early diagnosis and treatment.'  The team added: 'At the regional level, gout burden was found to be both higher in developed regions and the pace of increase was astonishing.'  Lynsey Conway, of the UK Gout Society secretariat, told The Times. 'Gout is an extremely painful condition which, left untreated, may lead to joint and kidney damage, permanent disability and an increased risk of early death.'  'While modifying diet and lifestyle can help, gout can only be treated, prevented and potentially cured by long-term treatment with medications that lower the level of uric acid in the blood.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599603/Cases-gout-spiralling-astonishing-rate-world.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,6ae3b114cb4e4691e6752fbfca5a86fccd07b685ea90ff8c607a7c8bd4d48484,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

And now a makeup artist has revealed how the Duchess has remained 'fresh faced and flawless' while wearing the face mask.  Expert Lisa Little told FEMAIL the Duchess has been highlighting her eyes with a strong brow and smokey eyeshadow, while keeping contouring soft and wearing a light lipstick, revealing: 'Kate nailed the âmask makeupâ by keeping her skin makeup soft and subtle, whilst playing up to one of her best features, her eyes.'  Kate Middleton, 38, appeared effortlessly elegant as she donned a face covering during a visit to Sheffield yesterday, with a makeup artist saying she had 'nailed' the mask makeup  Makeup artist Lisa Little told FEMAIL the Duchess had opted for a classic smokey eye, bold brow to highlight her eyes, while she also kept her base light to avoid 'mishaps' from removing the mask  The Duchess was first seen wearing the cotton face covering in Sheffield earlier this week.  The royal, who cut a stylish figure in an elegant white Â£1850 dress by Suzannah, was talking on a visit to a Baby Basics UK, to launch a new initiative she has spearheaded, getting 19 major UK retailers and brands to donate more than 10,000 new items to more than 40 baby banks across the UK.  The mother-of-three opted to wear the liberty-print mask while visiting the centre and chatting with families while helping to pack some of the boxes for the initiative.

Lisa revealed how Kate has been opting for a lighter foundation cover on recent visits, and adding a 'staple pop' of blush to her cheeks.  Meanwhile she added that the Duchess has also been keeping her contouring 'soft' so that the base would remain flawless even when the face covering was removed.  She explained: 'Kate kept her staple pop of colour on her checks with a soft powdered contour for when the mask was able to be removed.  The Duchess of Cambridge is renowned for her love of minimal and subtle make-up (pictured in Ireland in March)  'This allowed her to still look fresh faced and flawless.'  Lisa went on to reveal how the Duchess had highlighted her 'best feature' with a darker smokey eye and a dark brow.  She said: 'The focus was definitely on her eyes, with a bolder brow than usual teamed with the classic chic smokey eye. She rocked this look perfectly.'  Lisa explained: 'The mask makeup definitely makes us focus on the eyes more. It's a subtle look but it sure does make an impact.'  The makeup artist revealed how the Duchess had selected a subtle, barely-there lipstick in order to avoid smudges on her mask  Meanwhile Lisa explained how the Duchess had also opted for a light base covering and added a 'a soft powdered contour' for when the mask was able to be removed  Meanwhile Lisa also revealed how Kate had opted for a nude lipstick because it is the 'safest option' for avoiding any mishaps upon mask removal.  She went on: 'The safest option when wearing mask makeup is to opt for a light, nice lipstick. This will avoid any mishaps and smudging once the mask is removed.'

Parallels in styles, themes and motifs can link artworks painted in vastly different points in time and space â and shine new light on both works.  However, even the most knowledgeable of art critics could never take in the millions of paintings from across the centuries to be able to make all such connections.  The image retrieval software created by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Microsoft, however, has no such constraints.  In tests, the AI returned successfully revealed hidden connections between works held by New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and Amsterdamâs Rijksmuseum.  Art curators could face competition as researchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) that can spot 'hidden connections' between paintings. Pictured, the pairing of Francisco de ZurbarÃ¡nâs 'The Martyrdom of Saint Serapion' and Jan Asselijnâs 'The Threatened Swan' in the Rijksmuseum that inspired the researchers to develop the art-comparing AI  'Image retrieval systems let users find images that are semantically similar to a query image, serving as the backbone of reverse image search engines and many product recommendation engines,' said paper author and computer scientist Mark Hamilton.  'Restricting an image retrieval system to particular subsets of images can yield new insights into relationships in the visual world,' the MIT expert added.  'We aim to encourage a new level of engagement with creative artefacts.'  The team reportedly took inspiration from the Rijksmuseum's special 'RembrandtâVelÃ¡zquez' exhibit, which featured works from both Dutch and Spanish masters.  The collection included one unlikely, but similar, pair: Francisco de ZurbarÃ¡nâs 'The Martyrdom of Saint Serapion' and Jan Asselijnâs 'The Threatened Swan', which bear visual similarities while portraying scenes of profound altruism, the researchers said.  'These two artists did not have a correspondence or meet each other during their lives, yet their paintings hinted at a rich, latent structure that underlies both of their works,' explained Mr Hamilton.

The Â£400,000 Tretawdy Farm and Nature Reserve was given to charity by wealthy widow Eileen Cook who died in 2016 aged 98.  The 19-acre site is at the centre of a bitter dispute over plans to turn derelict barns into luxury holiday lodges.  When Mrs Cook passed away she gifted the farm and Tretawdy Nature Reserve to the Herefordshire Wildlife Trust.  It was conditional on the trust maintaining the site, which sits on the border of the Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), as a nature reserve.  Now the trust has applied for planning permission to convert two former barns into luxury self-catering accommodation for up to eight people.  Tretawdy Farm in Llangrove in Herefordshire is at the centre of a bitter planning row as Herefordshire Wildlift Trust have submitted plans to convert buildings into glamping site  The wildlife trust has defended the plans saying it was a 'fantastic opportunity' to secure a future for the dilapidated barns and attract a wider demographic to the nature reserve  The trust was left this nature reserve in the will of 98-year-old Eileen Cook back in 2016  Residents living nearby claim the plans go against the wishes of Mrs Cook, while others fear it will become a magnet for stag and hen parties.  Mrs Cook hit the headlines in 2010 when she was granted legal permission to boot out her daughter Pauline, then aged 60, and her husband Wyndham from the farm.  Despite both Mrs Cook and her estranged daughter living in opposite ends of the property in Herefordshire, neither had spoken for nearly a decade.  The bizarre arrangement attracted comparisons to Stella Gibbons' 1932 comic novel Cold Comfort Farm, the tale of a family with long-festering emotional problems which was made into a 1995 film starring Kate Beckinsale and Joanna Lumley.  Proposed development of the conversion of two barns into a luxury 6-8-person holiday let at The Tretawdy Nature Reserve, Llangrove, which locals fear will attract stag and hen parties  The farm was at the centre of a family row in 2010 when Mrs Cook granted legal permission to kick her daughter Pauline, then aged 60, and her husband Wyndham off the land  Cold Comfort Eviction Eileen Cook and Tretawdy Farm hit headlines in 2010 after Mrs Cook, then aged 92, won the right to evict her daughter from the farmhouse. Eileen lived in one part of the two-storey house while daughter Pauline Thomas, 60, and her 76-year-old husband Wyndham lived in another. Their not-so-cosy arrangement came to an end when Mrs Cook was given legal permission to evict the couple. A judge found Mr and Mrs Thomas had no right to live in the farmhouse and ordered them to leave immediately, as well as to pay Mrs Cook damages for 'trespass' and all legal costs. Mrs Cook said after the verdict that she had been forced to live in one room of the house and had not spoken to the couple in years, describing it as hell. The bizarre arrangement has attracted comparisons to Stella Gibbons' 1932 comic novel Cold Comfort Farm, the tale of a family with long-festering emotional problems . Advertisement  Now locked in another bitter dispute, residents of the community have hit out at the plans.  One of the objectors Paul Lodge, who lives in nearby Llangrove, said: 'Many in the local community are very disappointed that this application has been submitted without their knowledge or involvement.  'We also wish to raise concerns over the will of Mrs Eileen Cook, who left Tretawdy Farm to Herefordshire Wildlife Trust, which states that it must be maintained solely as a a nature reserve.  'This we believe is being ignored by the existence of and detail of this application.  'Several residents from Llangrove have written to HWT regarding the improper use of the land regarding Mrs Cook's intentions for her farm.'  Another objector Christopher Thomas said: 'It was left to become a nature reserve and it is now being turned into a holiday let.  'Hen and stag parties will use it.'  Another resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'By building lodges for up to eight people you will attract not just families but also larger groups.  'I genuinely think Mrs Cook would be turning in her grave if she thought her beautiful land was being used as some kind of entertainment venue.'  Llangarron parish council has also strongly objected to the proposals raising concerns over access, noise, traffic and lack of public consultation.  The wildlife trust hopes to convert the farm buildings into self-catered accommodation  The farm sits on the border of the Wye Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), as a nature reserve in Herefordshire and is currently owned by Herefordshire Wildlife Trust  James Hitchcock, wildlife trust estates manager, defended the plans saying it was a 'fantastic opportunity' to secure a future for the dilapidated barns.  He said: 'We think it is a use that is sustainable and in keeping with the wishes of Eileen Cook.  'And it can bring a wider demographic into our site and expose them to the work of Herefordshire Wildlife Trust and the wonderful countryside that is on offer in the lower Wye valley.  'And as a local charity and business we would also like to play our part in building back Herefordshire and promoting green tourism.'

The Location, Location, Location presenter said that those working from home should be eager to return to the office to 'prove their worth'.  She said: 'If your job can be done from home it can be done from abroad where wages are lower. If I had an office job I'd want to be first in the queue to get back to work and prove my worth to my employer. I am terrified by what could be on the horizon for so many.'  But she would soon subjected to a wave of abuse and wild accusations of 'attacking' those who are working from home by highlighting the economic devastation that is about to hit Britain.  A Bank of England report today forecast that a million people could lose their jobs this year and four million and unemployment could peak at 13 per cent in the first quarter of 2021 - which would mean more than four million people on the dole queue.  Critics condemned the presenter pointing to their 'highly stressful daily commute' and saying they did not want to 'risk their lives' by making a trip to the office.  -TV star Kirstie Allsopp has again sparked a Twitter row after suggesting employers could replace Brits working from home with cheaper staff from overseas  Ms Allsopp said on Twitter that she feared more jobs currently being done from home could be axed if employers instead look to outsource roles to lower-paid workers from other countries  However, not for the first time during the pandemic, she was bombarded with fury from followers  One wrote: 'We need to stop vilifying workers who continue to work from home. yes the localised office economy is down but let's remember that the home workers are now supporting and spending local to their home. Is this just fear for precious London. Perhaps the city bubble needs to end'  Another told the TV star to 'stop scaremongering', writing: 'Working from home has many benefits'  Another said: 'Good to know that the only way people can be valuable is by risking their lives at the hand of a pandemic that is in no way less of a threat than it was four months ago'  It comes as new figures today reveal fewer British office workers have returned to their workplace than in any other major European country.  Little more than a third (34 per cent) of UK staff are back at their desks, with the remainder continuing to work from home.  This contrasts with 83 per cent of French office staff and 70 per cent of Germans, according to a survey by researchers at investment bank Morgan Stanley.  In response to the wave of alarmism, Allsop added: 'This tweet is not an 'attack' on 'homeworkers' it's about the coming wave of redundancies and the fact that many believe that out of sight if out of mind. You can agree or disagree but that doesn't make it an 'attack'.'  Among those who responded to her first tweet was a user who pointed out: 'With a 3hr+ highly stressful daily commute to central London, I politely disagree.  'Many employers will be embracing the opportunity to move to smaller premises, whilst at least half of their employees continue to support the business extremely well - working from their own homes.'  Another added: 'We need to stop vilifying workers who continue to work from home. yes the localised office economy is down but let's remember that the home workers are now supporting and spending local to their home.  'Is this just fear for precious London. Perhaps the city bubble needs to end.'  A third told the TV star to 'stop scaremongering', writing: 'Working from home has many benefits, less cars on the road, better for the environment, less overheads to pay, more money to invest in development of employees, less time commuting, more time to spend with loved ones and better work/life balance.'  Another said: 'Good to know that the only way people can be valuable is by risking their lives at the hand of a pandemic that is in no way less of a threat than it was four months ago.'  The pile-on continued as another moaned in response: 'But you completely devalue someoneâs worth as an individual. We are not robots. And working from home works. I wish people (especially women) could be more open minded as itâs such a help for working mums.'  Miss Jo, an economist and entrepreneur, added: 'It is not as easy as that. You obviously have not tried to do this Schooling, education, language, culture. They all play a part. 'Suggesting that people can be so easily replaced with cheaper employees overseas is naive at best'  Another told her: 'With respect, I work for the government and my job can and is being done at home. Are you telling me that someone in Spain would be able to pick up my work, or understand our laws or society?'  Keren David added: 'You seem to assume that we're not proving our worth to our employers by working from home. In our case we're proving that we can produce a newspaper with all of us at home. I think we've all proved ourselves 100 times over anything we could do in an office. Harder on TV though'  Another tweeted said: 'I have been working from home since April. I have been doing all the same duties at home as I would do in an office. My productivity is better at home as no distractions, no commuting. I think you are out of order'  One-in-20 shielding Brits not planning to return to work soon Around one in 20 people in England who had been shielding because of coronavirus are not planning on returning to work over the next few months. Some 6 per cent of those classed as clinically extremely vulnerable, who had normally worked before receiving shielding advice, said they were not intending to go back to work in the near future. A further 21 per cent said they planned to continue working from home, while 35 per cent indicated they would return to their previous place of work. The figures are from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and are based on a survey conducted between July 9 and 16. A total of 2.2 million people in England were identified by the Government earlier this year as being clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) to the impact of Covid-19, and had been advised to shield from others. This advice was officially paused from August 1. Tim Gibbs, from the ONS public services analysis team, said: 'Before being advised to shield, almost a third of CEV people worked. 'Most are planning on returning to work or continuing to work from home in the next four months but around one in 20 CEV people are planning not to return to work. 'Of those who said they would return to work outside the home, 68 per cent reported they felt comfortable doing so, if either they or their employer put protective measures in place.' The figures also show that, of those surveyed, 60 per cent reported completely following shielding guidance - the equivalent of an estimated 1.3 million people. Some 65 per cent said they had received no visitors, except for support with personal care. On July 6 the Government advised that CEV people could form a support bubble with another household, as well as be in open spaces for exercise and other reasons. The ONS survey suggests that, of those who had received a visitor in the previous seven days not providing personal care, 36 per cent only had visitors from their support bubble, while 35 per cent had chosen not to form a bubble at all.

Ms Allsopp responded to the backlash from Britons reluctant to return to the office with a series of other tweets last night.  In one she wrote: 'This tweet is not an 'attack' on 'homeworkers', it's about the coming wave of redundancies and the fact that many believe that out of sight if out of mind. You can agree or disagree but that doesn't make it an 'attack'.  She then added: 'And there are many, many people for whom WFH has never been an option. There seems to be divide opening up between those who think 'I'm alright, this suits me' and those who work in industries that are dying in front of their eyes.'  She also backed the idea of 'work hubs' being set up close to people's homes so they could still benefit from being an office environment, without having to endure a lengthy commute.  In another tweet, referencing the huge explosion in Lebanon on Tuesday, she said: 'What's pathetic about today, and really sad is that by tweet about work got thousands, thousands more RTs than my one about Save the Children and how to help those poor souls in Beirut.'  It is not the first time Ms Allsopp has faced a backlash on social media in recent months, after a tongue-in-cheek comment that she was not going back to work until she can have her eyebrows threaded sparked anger.  Meanwhile, Pimlico Plumbers entrepreneur Charlie Mullins has been criticised after saying those still working from home are 'selfish' and 'don't care about the economy' - in comments made from sunny Marbella.  Mullins, from Essex, who runs one of Britainâs biggest independent plumbing firms, hit headlines last week after firing around 30 staff when they refused to return to work, following the end of his companyâs use of the Government furlough scheme.  Appearing on This Morning today alongside businesswoman Kirsty Hulse, from Stoke-On-Trent, he said that the scheme promotes a 'benefits culture' and that 'everyone needs to pull their weight' to boost the economy.  Viewers quickly took to Twitter to share their view, with many arguing they did not 'choose' to be on the furlough scheme, and felt his point may be more effective if he wasn't 'sunning himself in Marbella'.  Ms Allsopp responded to the backlash with a series of other tweets last night, describing the fact her tweets had created more engagement than ones about the explosion in Beirut as 'pathetic'  She also backed the idea of 'work hubs' being set up close to people's homes so they could still benefit from being an office environment, without having to endure a lengthy commute  In one she wrote: 'This tweet is not an 'attack' on 'homeworkers', it's about the coming wave of redundancies and the fact that many believe that out of sight if out of mind.

That is less than the 10 per cent it anticipated before, but roughly equivalent to a million people joining the dole queue.  The Bank added that it expects the economy to shrink by 9.5 per cent in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic - less than the previous estimate of 14 per cent.  That would make it the biggest recession since the fallout from Spanish Flu and the First World War hammered the country in the 1920s, rather than the Great Frost of 1609 as initially thought.  However, the recovery could also be slower with UK plc not returning to the same size as the end of 2019 until at least the end of 2021.  The Bank has decided to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.1 per cent, and its quantitative easing programme - effectively printing money to prop up the economy - at Â£745billion.

The Bank expects the economy to shrink by an eye-watering 9.5 per cent this year, causing a wave of misery and job losses not experienced for decades.  But the scale of the hit to GDP has been downgraded from the previous estimate of 14 per cent. Instead of the biggest recession in 300 years, that would make it the worst since the fallout from Spanish Flu and the First World War hammered the country in the 1920s.  Despite the crumb of comfort, the Bank said the recovery could also be slower with UK plc not returning to the same size as the end of 2019 until at least the end of 2021.  Meanwhile, the unemployment rate could rise from the current level of 3.9 per cent to hit 7.4 per cent by the end of the year before slowly subsiding, according to the latest Monetary Policy Report. That is less than the 10 per cent it anticipated before, but roughly equivalent to a million people joining the dole queue.  The rate will still not have returned to pre-coronavirus levels by the end of 2022.  The Bank decided to keep interest rates at a record low of 0.1 per cent, and its quantitative easing programme - effectively printing money to prop up the economy - at Â£745billion.  Governor Andrew Bailey warned of 'hard yards' to come, and said it was ready to give more stimulus if needed.  'There are some very hard yards, to borrow a rugby phrase, to come. And frankly, we are ready to act, should that be needed,' he told a press conference.  The Bank expects the economy to shrink by 9.5 per cent in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic - less than the previous estimate of 14 per cent  The unemployment rate could hit 7.4 per cent by the end of the year, according to the latest Monetary Policy Report - and there is considerable uncertainty  The latest prediction from the Bank suggests the downturn will be the biggest since the early 1920s, when the First World War and Spanish Flu hammered the economy  Construction sector rebounds - but firms still slash jobs The UK construction industry stayed in strong positive territory for the second month in a row in July as builders continued to work after weeks of Covid-19 lockdown. However, the employment levels also suffered a sustained decline as firms slashed jobs, despite improving levels of activity. The closely followed IHS Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers' index (PMI) hit a reading of 58.1 last month, compared to 55.3 in June. Analysts had predicted a score of 57, according to an average compiled by Pantheon Macroeconomics. Any reading above 50 represents an expansion in business activity. The reading represented the steepest growth in construction work since October 2015, driven by rapid expansion in the residential building sector. Advertisement  The report said: 'UK GDP is expected to have been over 20 per cent lower in 2020 Q2 than in 2019 Q4.  'But higher-frequency indicators imply that spending has recovered significantly since the trough in activity in April.

'Housing market activity appears to have returned to close to normal levels, despite signs of a tightening in credit supply for some households.  'There is less evidence available on business spending, but surveys suggest that business investment is likely to have fallen markedly in Q2 and investment intentions remain very weak.'  In a cautionary note, it added: 'The outlook for the UK and global economies remains unusually uncertain. It will depend critically on the evolution of the pandemic, measures taken to protect public health, and how governments, households and businesses respond to these factors.'  In May the MPC said the UK might return to its pre-pandemic size in the second half of next year - but since then the signs of recovery have been mixed.  The Bank said the British economy will be hit harder than many others in the second quarter of the year, dropping 21 per cent compared to the first three months. The Euro area is expected to decline by 12.1 per cent and the US 9.5 per cent in the same period.  However, the UK did go into lockdown later than much of Europe and GDP went down by less in the first quarter.  Painting a grim picture of the employment market, the report said the impact would be most felt in some of the most job-heavy sectors of the economy.  'Some firms, especially those in the worst-affected sectors, are likely to make workers redundant if sales do not pick up sufficiently quickly. Many firms in highly consumer-facing sectors, manufacturing and construction expect to reduce their employment materially in Q3 and Q4,' the report said.  'Some of these industries are labour-intensive, employing more workers per unit of output than average. This means the total fall in employment will be higher than if all industries were reducing their workforces by similar percentages.'  Its latest estimates suggest that inflation could tumble to zero this year before climbing again.  The Bank also once again raised the prospect of negative interest rates - meaning that its commercial clients would effectively pay a charge to keep money safe. Supporters of the idea say it would encourage businesses to invest and help the recovery rather than sitting on reserves.  'The effectiveness of a negative policy rate will depend, in part, on the structure of the financial system and how the policy transmits through banks to the interest rates facing households and companies. It will also depend on the financial and economic conditions at the time,' the report said.  'The MPC will continue to keep under review the appropriateness of a negative policy rate alongside all of its policy tools.'  James Smith, Research Director at the Resolution Foundation, said: 'While today's forecasts from the Bank of England now point to a smaller initial economic hit from the coronavirus crisis than it predicted back in May, they still make troubling reading with the UK expected to see the largest fall in GDP among rich countries.  'But with rates mired at all-time lows, the Bank can do little to help support the economy. Instead, the bold steps needed to help the economy â and particularly the labour market â will have to come from the Government.  The Bank said the British economy will be hit harder than many others in the second quarter of the year, dropping 21 per cent compared to the first three months  The OBR's downside scenario published last month saw unemployment rising to more than four million next year - with a rate higher than seen in the 1980s  'Urgent action is needed from the Chancellor to support jobs while also helping those who are unlucky enough become unemployed.'  The value of the pound picked up against the dollar after traders welcomed the decision to hold rates.  Fiona Cincotta, analyst at Gain Capital, said: 'The Bank of England was considerably more upbeat about the recovery than had been expected.  'Upwardly revised growth forecasts, a more rapid recovery than initially feared and no tilting towards negative rates at this time has sent sterling surging towards 1.32 US dollars.'  Last month the OBR warned tax rises and spending cuts - potentially equivalent to as much as 12p on the basic rate of income tax - are inevitable as it poured cold water on hopes of a 'V-shaped' bounceback from coronavirus.  It said GDP will fall by up to 14 per cent this year, the worst recession in 300 years, with national debt bigger than the whole economy.  Underlining the scale of the hit, government liabilities will be Â£710billion more than previously expected by 2023-4. That is equivalent to nearly Â£11,000 for every man, woman and child in the UK.  Output might not return to last year's level until the end of 2024, according to the estimates. Accounting for inflation, the country will still be 6 per cent poorer in 2025 in the gloomiest outcome.  Meanwhile, unemployment could peak at 13 per cent in the first quarter of 2021 - which would mean more than four million people on the dole queue.  That would be significantly worse than the 11.9 per cent jobless rate from 1984, and the highest since modern records began in the 1970s.

Driver demonstrates novel way to cut an apple in half using her car window,"A woman showed off a unique way of splitting an apple - by using her car window.  Anna Zhakova, 32, from Saint-Petersburg, Russia, decided to show off her bizarre trick to her followers in an Instagram video.  She slices the apple clean in half by rolling the car window up, with the apple placed between the door frame and the glass.  The footage shows Anna sitting in her retro car, a blue Lada Riva, about to bite into an apple.  Anna Zhakova, 32, from Saint-Petersburg, Russia is just about to bite into an apple when her friend knocks on the window asking to share  She balances the apple in the tight gap - between the car door frame and the glass - and rolls up the car window, slicing the apple perfectly in half  Just before she takes a bite of the apple, her friend knocks on the window and Anna rolls the window down a fraction to talk to her.  Her friend asks to share her snack, at which Anna motions at her with her hand to wait a minute.  She places the apple in the car window - between the car door frame and the glass - and begins to wind the window up.  Juice runs down the glass but the apple perfectly splits in two so she can easily share the fruit with her friend.  Juice drips down the glass as Anna winds the window up to share the fruit with her friend  The video, which was posted on Instagram on April 22, is captioned: 'Everyone enjoy your dinner.'  Ms Zhakova is a professional wakeboarder from Russia after turning pro in 2015.  The novel trick is similar to other fruit-slicing internet videos, such as the martial instructor from Kazakhstan.  Farabi Davletchin, a Taekwondo instructor from Almaty, Kazakhstan, showcased his fruit-slicing tricks on his Instagram account.

On Wednesday, the Gunners announced they were to take cost-cutting measures by letting 55 members of staff go as the coronavirus pandemic continues to negatively impact the Gunners' finances.  And following the controversial decision which has reportedly left Arsenal players feeling 'betrayed', Morgan heavily slammed the move from his club after their 14th FA Cup triumph last weekend.  Arsenal have been slammed for making 55 redundancies amid the coronavirus pandemic  Piers Morgan labelled Arsenal's decision as 'shameful' and 'morally indefensible' on Twitter  Morgan took to Twitter: 'Arsenal firing 55 staff when we're owned by a multi-billionaire, have just made Â£Â£Â£ by winning the FA Cup & qualifying for Europe, & pay Mesut Ozil Â£350k-a-week to sit on his a***, is morally indefensible & not what I expect from a club with our heritage. Shameful decision.'  Arsenal legend Wright, who scored 185 goals during his time in north London, also hit out at his former club's decision.  On social media, he echoed a famous Arsenal saying from his great friend David Rocastle: 'Remember who you are, what you are and who you represent!!!'  The Gunners' playing squad and head coach Mikel Arteta took a 12.5 per cent pay cut each in April to safeguard the economic future of the club amid the pandemic.  Arsenal legend Ian Wright also took aim on social media on Thursday following the decision  And according to The Athletic, several of Arsenal's first-team players are frustrated and disappointed in the club as they believed their voluntary wage cut was going to help save jobs.  Some Arsenal players, including highest-earner Ozil on a Â£350,00-a-week contract, refused to take the pay cut due to a lack of assurances of where the money was going.  The players who did take a pay-cut earned some of the money back when they won the FA Cup and qualified for the Europa League, a condition that was made when the pay-cut was decided.  And they Arsenal's players want to hold talks with the club after feeling 'betrayed' by the club's controversial decision.  In a statement on Wednesday made by the club's sporting and financial chiefs Raul Sanllehi and Vinai Venkatesham, they admitted the cuts were necessary in order to make sure they 'operate in a sustainable and responsible way' amid the crisis.  Sanllehi and Venkatesham also confirmed that investment in the first-team squad is a 'key priority' and that a 30-day consultation period will begin to determine the redundancies.  Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke's personal value has increased by Â£300million this calendar year  The club statement read: 'We do not make these proposals lightly and have looked at every aspect of the club and our expenditure before reaching this point.  'We are now entering the required 30-day consultation period on these proposals. We know this is upsetting and difficult for our dedicated staff and our focus is on managing this as sensitively as possible.  'Our main sources of income have all reduced significantly. Revenue from broadcasters, matchday and commercial activities have all been hit severely and these impacts will continue into at least the forthcoming 2020-21 season.  'The pandemic represents one of the most challenging periods in our 134-year history and we have responded promptly by implementing wide-ranging measures to reduce our costs.  Arsenal players felt 'betrayed' by the decision having taken a 12.5 per cent pay cut each  'These proposed changes are ultimately about ensuring we take this great football club forward, creating the right organisation for a post-Covid world, and ensuring we have the resources to return to competing effectively at the top of the game here and in Europe.'  The Gunners hierarchy came in for fierce criticism amid their recent FA Cup triumph which brought in increased revenue and the fortunes of Stan Kroenke - while Mesut Ozil continues to sit on Â£350,000-per-week.  Arsenal received a financial boost when they won the FA Cup, thereby qualifying for European football which earned them Â£2.6m in prize money. This could rise up to Â£41m, depending on how far the Gunners go in next year's tournament.  Furthermore, Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke's wealth has grown by Â£300m during 2020, according to American thinktank Billionaire Bonanza 2020. The American businessman is believed to be worth around Â£8.1bn.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-8599709/Arsenals-shameful-decision-make-55-staff-redundant-slammed-Piers-Morgan.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,a071ed5b276a2e69c60969976f9df243aa030d865dd29628e9acd295fac20aee,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Google's junk food crackdown will come into force in the EU and the UK in October and will prevent ads for products that are high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) from being shown to under-18s.  The Search giant says it currently has no plans to expand this beyond Europe.  The announcement comes just days after Boris Johnson announced Britain's new anti-obesity drive.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said previously that if all overweight adults were to lose just five pounds in weight it could save the NHS Â£100 million.  The Government's National Obesity Strategy involves banning all TV adverts for foods high fat, sugar and salt before 9pm in the UK.  Scroll down for video  Google's junk food crackdown will prevent companies that sell products high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) from being shown to under-18s in the EU and UK as of October (file)  Google will use its vast technological prowess to enforce a blanket ban on any products being shown to children which are deemed unhealthy, including cakes, hot dogs and energy drinks.  Companies wanting to use Google to advertise will have to declare if their product is high in HFSS.  Failure to declare could result in the adverts being pulled completely, it is believed.  These will be automatically tagged and Google's algorithms will not show them to under-18s.  The age of users will be worked out based on the age they provided when creating their YouTube/Google account.  A Google Spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We have strict advertising policies that are designed to both protect users and help advertisers seamlessly comply with the latest industry and regulatory standards.  'This week, we are introducing a new policy to prohibit the promotion of High Fat Salt Sugar food and beverage products to minors in the EU and UK.'  Boris Johnson, pictured left in February and right this week, says he has lost more than a stone and has launched the National Obesity Strategy which involves banning all TV adverts for foods high fat, sugar and salt before 9pm in the UK  What is in Boris Johnson's new anti-obesity strategy? - Shops Stores will be barred from pushing 'buy one, get one free' promotions on unhealthy products as the Government looks to reduce the temptation to snack. Supermarket managers will also be banned from placing confectionery in tempting locations, such as store entrances and beside checkouts, and will instead be encouraged to offer more discounts on fruit and vegetables. - Advertising The Prime Minister's strategy will put an end to junk food adverts on television and online before the 9pm watershed in a bid to shield youngsters at a time when their food preferences are being set. The Government will also hold a consultation into whether the planned internet advertising restrictions could be wider reaching, with a total ban on advertising food high in fat, sugar or salt an option under consideration. - Calorie counting Ministers will introduce new legislation forcing restaurants and takeaways with more than 250 employees to add calorie labels to their menus to assist diners in making more informed choices. The Department of Health said a consultation would follow before the end of the year to help decide whether the same type of calorie labelling on alcohol should be required. - Health service interventions To help people lose the pounds, NHS weight management services will be expanding, with more smartphone apps rolled out with the purpose of improving lifestyle and overall health. The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme will also see improvements. GPs will be encouraged to prescribe exercise and other social activities to help people keep fit, with cycling pilots in the poorest areas set to provide bikes to entice people into upping their activity levels. - Food packet labelling A consultation - the third associated with the strategy - will gather evidence on how the current 'traffic light' labelling system on food packets is being used by consumers and industry, while comparing it to other international examples. The labelling is used to highlight the fat content and other barometers of how healthy a product is to help shoppers understand what is in the food they buy. Advertisement  If a user is not logged in to their accounts, the default setting will be to not show the adverts for the unhealthy treats.  It remains to be seen how effective Google is at policing its adverts, following a string of embarrassing and dangerous blunders which left children exposed.  Last year it emerged paedophiles were swarming to the comments section of videos, targeting children.  Advertisers such as Nestle and Epic Games, who had ads in close proximity to such comments, stopped buying the space until it was resolved.  Google's failure to protect children on its platform resulted in the Financial Conduct Authority having to step in.  Britain's ongoing obesity epidemic has been highlighted in the midst of the coronavirus crisis.  Public Health England recently reported that being overweight makes a person three times more likely to die from Covid-19.  People who have extra weight, defined as a body mass index of over 25, are also at higher odds of needing ventilation when ill with Covid-19 by seven-fold.  The report said excess weight does not seem to increase people's chances of contracting Covid-19, but said excess fat can affect the respiratory system and is likely to affect immune function.  Experts behind the report said 'every kilo' people lost would reduce their risk of being admitted to hospital with the coronavirus.  Boris Johnson used himself as an example of Britain's obesity epidemic, saying he was 'too fat' when he was admitted to hospital with the coronavirus.  Since recovering he claims to be going on morning runs with his dog Dilyn.  He is urging the nation to follow his lead, insisting the Government's 'better health strategy' will help people to 'bring their weight down' and better protect the NHS.  The UK is the second fattest country in Europe with two-thirds of adults above a healthy weight, according to Government data, and one in three children aged 10 to 11 are overweight or obese.  The Government's new anti-obesity strategy spells the end of confectionery displays at store checkouts and a ban on adverts for foods high in fat, sugar and salt on TV before 9pm.  Deals such as 'buy one get one free' on unhealthy foods will also be banned, while alcoholic drinks could soon have to list their calorie content.  Placing sugary and fatty items in prominent locations in stores will be stopped, including at checkouts and entrances, and online.  Instead, shops will be encouraged to promote healthier choices and offer more discounts on healthy food such as fruit and vegetables.  The Government will also hold a consultation on whether the ban on online adverts for foods high in salt, sugar and fat should apply at all times of the day.  Mr Johnson said in a video posted on Twitter to mark the launch of the strategy that 'like many people I struggle with my weight' and he had 'always wanted to lose weight for ages and ages'.  'But since I have recovered from coronavirus I have been steadily building up my fitness,' he said.  'I don't want to make any excessive claims because I have only just started concentrating on it but I am more than a stone down.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8599571/Google-YouTube-BLOCK-junk-food-adverts-18s.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,0b752a928a68a83d6fad198749ebd1da22d019829c860b99238f14e47cdb2f07,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

'Let's not kid anyone, the majority of people are in the position to go back to work, but they don't want to go back to work.  'If you're paying anyone to sit at home and do nothing, that's what they're going to do. Most people the workplace is too far from the beach for them.

Viewers quickly took to Twitter to share their view, with many arguing they did not 'choose' to be on the furlough scheme, and felt his point may be more effective if he wasn't 'sunning himself in Marbella'  Speaking about working from home, he went on: 'Let's not kid anyone, that's fine for the minority, but not for the majority.  'To get things going we need to get a taxi, go for a coffee and that won't happen at home, and I think it's selfish some people are working from home and don't care about the economy.'  Viewers soon took to Twitter to share their views, with one writing: 'Does the Pimlico guy know people don't get to pick and choose if they are on furlough'.  Another wrote: 'I work in a hotel and I've been on furlough all through lockdown. I didn't go abroad, I didn't go to the beach, I didn't go to town unless I needed food for my kids and the whole time I was productive at home. Furlough helped me survive and I'm grateful for it.'  Charlie told that the scheme promotes a 'benefits culture' and that 'everyone needs to pull their weight' to boost the economy  Kirsty, founder of consultancy firm Roar Training, disagreed and felt that allowing staff to have the benefits of working from home  A third agreed: 'My husband is a key worker and I am self employed and run out of work now because term based. No one is lazing about, they are following government guidelines.'  'Charlie Mullins might be able to make his point a bit more forceful if he wasn't sunning himself in Marbella', said a fourth.  Kirsty, founder of consultancy firm Roar Training, disagreed and felt that allowing staff to have the benefits of working from home, and 'treating them like adults', will create a more productive work environment.  'I think for me it's subjective,' she said. 'But why wouldn't we allow someone to do the school run?

If we're hiring people who are engaged and motivated they will get the job done.'  However, Charlie went on to argue that working from home and the furlough scheme means it will be harder for employees to get back to the workplace, and they're not necessarily more productive at home.  'You'll create a culture like people on benefits, he said. 'And the longer people stay home, the longer it will be to get back in the work place.

Dean Darke, 60, and wife May caught the men crawling out on their driveway in Basildon, Essex, after the journey last Wednesday.  The stowaways had boarded the van as it arrived at the port city of Caen, ahead of the Darkes' 225-mile drive home via Portsmouth.  They got out on the couple's driveway and waited beside the van until police came to arrest them.  It comes as boatloads of migrants are illegally travelling to Britain everyday, with 120 making it to the UK on Tuesday.  Dean Darke, 60, and wife May caught the men crawling out on their driveway in Basildon, Essex, after the journey last Wednesday  Mrs Darke's stunned neighbours watched on as officers led them away to be questioned by immigration officials.  She said: 'We went to France to help my sister who is moving back to Essex. We got the van and drove there and back.  'It was checked in France and here too. I'm unsure where the two men got into the van.  'When we got home we heard a noise and the men came from under the van. We were shocked and quite frightened.  'But they were very placid and I told them I was calling the police and they sat down and waited for the police.'  She added: 'It was quite scary as we didn't know what was going to happen and whether they were going to attack us.  'I felt some sympathy for them as they must have been hanging on under the van and they must have been quite desperate to make a journey like that.  'But I felt angry that I'd been dragged into them doing something illegal and also felt violated that they were found on my drive outside my home where I should feel safe.'  Mrs Darke slammed port authorities in Britain and France for failing to spot them when they checked their vehicle.  Dozens more migrants - including a heavily-pregnant woman - reached Britain by small boat today, after 13 landed yesterday.

Thirteen more migrants reached Britain by small boat yesterday, with dozens more including a heavily pregnant woman landing today (pictured)  The group, who were Afghan, Iranian, Iraqi, Eritrean and Sri Lankan, were picked up at 8.30am by a lifeboat off the Kent coast  The 10 men and three women were taken into Dover to be medically checked and questioned by immigration officials.  It means 3,643 migrants have made the life-risking Channel crossing this year - nearly double the 1,850 who arrived last year.  Meanwhile, a group of around 16 refugees including 10 young children landed on Dungeness beach in Kent around 8.30am today.  It is thought they were all on one small boat. Several more vessels are thought to have been detected off Kent.  One of the children, a boy aged around four, looked exhausted as he laid back on the pebbles with his arms spread out.  The children all wore coats and one of the girls had a fluffy red onesie on.  The pregnant woman - thought to be eight months along - was wearing a black dress and face mask as she held the hand of a child.  She looked weary and had her head in her hand at one point.  Amateur photographer Susan Pilcher, who saw them on the beach, said: 'I could hear the Border Force workers asking how many months pregnant she was and she said eight.  'They didn't speak much English at all. When you think that she's doing such a risky crossing over the Channel when she's heavily pregnant, that says how much they've been through.

'It's heartbreaking - you can't imagine what they've been through, but for them it's just like a day out.  'It was good to see them wrapped up warm - they don't always have coats on and it must be really cold out at sea at night. I feel so sorry for all of them.'  Border Force, police and paramedics were at the scene and the migrants had their temperatures taken.  Conditions were perfect for crossing with a calm sea and good visibility.

The multinational giant, which is valued at $1.5 trillion, has told businesses in the UK that it will increase its referral fees, fulfilment by Amazon fees, monthly FBA Storage fees and multichannel fulfilment fees by two per cent from September.  The internet shopping giant, which made a Â£4 billion profit in the second quarter alone, said the decision was prompted by the UK's two per cent digital sales tax, which came into force on April 1.  Following their announcement, Lord Leigh of Hurley, Conservative peer and party treasurer, said the company was constantly in a 'fight against good behaviour.'  Amazon has come under fire after it announced plans to hit small businesses that sell items on its website. (Stock image)  He told The Times: 'Amazon are further engendering the risk that they exhibit monopolistic behaviour. And that will have consequences. They constantly fight against good behaviour.'  Meanwhile Darren Jones, chairman of the business, energy and industrial strategy select committee, told the paper: 'Local high street retailers don't get to opt out of VAT or business rates. Amazon shouldn't be able to opt out of fair taxes either.'  The company, which was founded in 1994 by entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, currently charges those who wish to sell items on their website a 15 per cent referral fee on every sale.  However its latest move has angered sellers who argued the plans would see small businesses absorb the new digital tax in the UK.  Sharing their frustrations on an Amazon sellers forum, one user wrote: 'Yep - we all get properly shafted yet again. It's not a coincidence that our Jeff is wealthiest man on planet Earth.  'The UK government were supposed to be implementing this additional tax to reflect the disparity between where profits are taxed versus where the value is created. (FAIL). Bottom line is, we all end up paying 2 per cent more to Amazon to cover it on their behalf.'  While another frustrated seller wrote: 'This is Amazon giving the finger to the UK government.'  Another person added: 'The customer will eventually pay the tax, wait and see!'  Elsewhere, one seller wrote: 'They are bleeding us dry. I am seriously considering switching some of my faster moving lines onto eBay.'  The tech giant, which is valued at $1.5 trillion, said the decision was prompted by the UK's two per cent digital sales tax, which came into force on April 1. (Stock image)  The internet shopping giant told its seller that it would be increasing its referral fees, fulfilment by Amazon fees, monthly FBA Storage fees and multichannel fulfilment fees by two percent from September in a message on their website  Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'Government and Amazon should work together to find a way to resolve this impasse and prevent millions of pounds of extra costs being imposed on the small firms who are only just starting to recover from the biggest crisis for generations.  'The tax is aimed at the profits of multinationals with large revenues. Passing the tax on to their small business customers will hurt them at the worst possible time.'  An Amazon spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Like many others, we have encouraged the Government to pursue a global agreement on the taxation of the digital economy at OECD level rather than unilateral taxes, so that rules would be consistent across countries and clearer and fairer for businesses.  'As we've previously indicated, the way that the Government has designed the Digital Services Tax will directly impact the businesses that use our services.'  The move by Amazon comes after its former UK boss, Doug Gurr, tried to warn the Government off the tax, saying it would be passed on.  In a note to UK sellers, Amazon said: 'While the legislation was being passed, and as we continued our discussions with the government to encourage them to take an approach that would not impact our selling partners, we absorbed this increase.  'Now the legislation has passed, we will be increasing referral fees, fulfilment by Amazon fees, monthly storage fees and multi-channel fulfilment fees by 2 per cent to reflect this additional cost.'  Amazon introduced similar changes in France last year.  The Treasury has said it hopes to raise Â£500million a year from the digital sales tax.  In April, technology firms including Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon pleaded that they should not have to pay a newly-imposed UK digital services tax.  Trade body TechUK, which represents hundreds of technology companies in Britain including the four giants, said the Government should 'look again' at the new levy.

Demelza Jefferis, from Plymouth, Devon, had been getting out of the shower when she accidentally dropped her towel and noticed a strange mark on her cleavage.  The 42-year-old dismissed it as a stretch mark at first, before taking another look and realising it was a small dent that only appeared when her arm was raised.  After contacting her GP, mammograms and biopsies confirmed she had stage two breast cancer on April 21 this year - less than a month after she first noticed the mark.  An operation to remove the cancer in May was successful and Demelza was given the all-clear - but she is now sharing her experience in the hope of raising awareness about this little-known sign of the disease.  Demelza Jefferis (seen left), from Plymouth, Devon, has revealed how she was left in tears of 'disbelief' when doctors confirmed that a small dent (seen right) she first dismissed as a stretch mark was in fact a sign of breast cancer  Demelza said she has always been thorough in checking her breasts for lumps because her grandmother died from breast cancer aged 58.  But after discovering the dent thanks to dropping her towel by chance, she believes someone was 'watching over her' that day to help her spot the sign of cancer.  The mother-of-one lifted and relaxed her arm close to 100 times to inspect the small crease which appeared by her left nipple, before calling husband Gary Jefferis, 42, to see if he could see it too.  Demelza said: 'I've always looked at my boobs, checked and felt them. I've always been amazed at how many people have actually said they would never think to check. It takes two minutes.  'But when I didn't actually look and feel, it was the time that something was actually there. Someone was definitely looking over me that day, for sure.  The mother-of-one (pictured) had been getting out of the shower when she accidentally dropped her towel and noticed a strange mark on her cleavage  The 42-year-old (pictured with her husband Gary) dismissed it as a stretch mark at first, before taking another look and realising it was a small dent that only appeared when her arm was raised  'I'm a true believer in that - someone was looking over me and saying, ""We need to get you to have a look"". It's really uncanny how everything unfolded.  Eight most common signs of breast cancer â¢ A change in size or shape â¢ A lump or area that feels thicker than the rest of the breast â¢ A change in skin texture such as puckering or dimpling (like the skin of an orange) â¢ A redness or rash on the skin and/or around the nipple â¢ Your nipple has become pulled in or looks different, for example changed its position or shape â¢ Liquid that comes from the nipple without squeezing â¢ Pain in your breast or your armpit thatâs there all or almost all of the time â¢ A swelling in your armpit or around your collarbone Advertisement  Recalling the moment she discovered the mark, Demelza said: '[When lockdown started], I was more concerned that I wouldn't be able to have my armpits waxed.  'I got out of the shower and thought, ""oh my god, my armpits are so bad that I don't want to shave them, I'm going to have to look at getting some home wax kit"".  'With that, I had my left arm up and my towel dropped. As my towel dropped, I went to grab it and I looked up in the mirror. The light was shining through the window, and I thought, ""Oh, what's that?"".  'I thought, having had kids, it was just a stretch mark, until I put my arm back up. I didn't like the look of it at all.  'I put my arm up again to check. I must have done it a good 10 to 100 times because every time I put my arm up it was there, and every time I put it down, it wasn't there.  'I shouted to my husband and told him that he needed to check both my boobs and tell me if he sees anything on them at all. I kept putting it up and down, and we both checked, and he said: ""That's definitely not right"".'  After tests confirmed her cancer diagnosis, the mother-of-one had an operation on May 18 to remove the lump from her chest.  Demelza, who works as a prescription clerk supervisor, said: 'I don't remember much of the consultation [where they diagnosed me]. They were telling me the plan for treatment and I was just in tears.  'I couldn't believe it was happening. I still can't get my head around the fact it's happened. With COVID-19 and everything that's happened, it has been such a blur. It's just weird.  After contacting her GP, mammograms and biopsies confirmed she had stage two breast cancer on April 21 this year - less than a month after she first noticed the mark. An operation to remove the cancer in May was successful and Demelza (pictured above is her chest after surgery) was given the all-clear  Demelza, pictured with her husband at their vow renewal last year, is now sharing her traumatic experience in the hope of raising awareness about this little-known sign of the condition  'It's gone now, and it's done. I can build a bridge and get over it. But it was very overwhelming.'  Speaking about her treatment, she said: 'They removed the lump and a couple of lymph nodes from my armpit. They sent those away for testing to make sure it was all clear. None of my lymph nodes had cancer in them.  'It was really, really good. My consultant said to me, ""You caught this early. You're so lucky to have found what you did"".'  After two weeks of radiotherapy, Demelza completed her treatment on July 31 - on her 16th wedding anniversary.  Now she is urging women to be thorough when checking their breasts and to look for signs of visual change, such as dents and dimpling, as well as feeling for lumps.  Demelza said: 'Just check your boobs. It's so important that people don't leave it. It takes two minutes to check your boobs. People have just got to do it. It can change your whole life.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8599441/Mother-reveals-small-dent-dismissed-stretch-mark-turned-breast-cancer.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,bdb336a5ad7ee76a61ef6c56bea86313edb8e457776813e3be64ef61934120f1,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The collapse in demand for air travel due to the COVID-19 pandemic meant the airline carried 96 per cent fewer passengers between April and June than a year earlier, leading to an 80 per cent decline in second-quarter revenue to 1.9 billion euros (Â£1.7billion).  Tentative signs of a European recovery now appear threatened by new localised outbreaks and restrictions, while long-haul flights such as to the United States - which are important for Lufthansa - remain largely grounded due to rising infections.  'We do not expect demand to return to pre-crisis levels before 2024,' Chief Executive Carsten Spohr said on Thursday.  A March 2020 file photo shows planes of German carrier Lufthansa parked on a closed runway at the airport in Frankfurt, Germany during the coronavirus pandemic  Lufthansa's pessimistic view echoed a forecast last month by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) that it would take a year longer than previously expected for passenger traffic to return to pre-crisis levels..  Last month Lufthansa said it would cut 20 per cent of its leadership positions and 1,000 administrative jobs as it seeks to repay a 9 billion euro (Â£8.1billion) state bailout and navigate deepening losses in the face of the pandemic.  The airline had 8,300 fewer employees by the end of June, due mainly to people leaving jobs at its catering business and non-German businesses, which include Swiss, Austrian Airlines and Brussels Airlines. It aims to reduce 22,000 full-time jobs.  It said forced redundancies can no longer be ruled out in Germany due to worsening market conditions and faltering negotiations with unions.  Pictured: Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr awaits the arrival of a Lufthansa Cargo aircraft from Shanghai, carrying eight million protective masks in Munich, Germany in an April photo  Lufthansa plans to increase short and medium-haul capacity to 55 per cent of prior-year capacity in the fourth quarter and 50 per cent on long-haul routes. Air France-KLM, which also secured a state-backed rescue, aims to operate at two thirds of capacity before the end of the year.  The adjusted operating loss of 1.7 billion (Â£1.53billion) was almost 300 million euros (Â£270million) lower than analysts surveyed by the company had expected on average.  Lufthansa also said it expects to post an adjusted operating loss in the second half of 2020 and a further significant decline in adjusted operating profit for the full-year.

With the clock running down to the end of the transition period in December, the two sides still appear to be deadlocked over calls for Britain to fall into line with EU rules and access to fishing waters.  The government insists it is ready to walk away this Autumn if there is no hope of a breakthrough. Another round of discussions between the EU's Michel Barnier and British counterpart David Frost is due to take place in Brussels this month.  Ministers have told drugs companies to restart stockpiling medicines amid fears that trade terms will not be settled in time.  Berlin's Europe minister Michael Roth (right) said he was 'disappointed' with the tough stance taken by Boris Johnson (left) amid rising fears that the negotiations could fail  Department of Health officials sent a letter to medical suppliers urging them to 'replenish' their drug stock.  They have even warned companies to be prepared to reroute shipping to avoid the Channel.  The government has also revealed plans to fine lorry drivers destined for the Channel ports Â£300 if they drive into Kent after December 31 without necessary export paperwork.  Ministers fear that, in the absence of a trade deal, the EU will impose strict import checks on all goods entering the bloc, potentially causing gridlock.  In an interview with the AFP news agency, Mr Roth said he was 'disappointed that London is shifting further and further away from the political declaration agreed between us as a reliable basis for negotiations'.

Bosses at the National Education Union (NEU), the UK's largest teaching union, say it may be 'impossible' for 'many' schools to reopen at the start of the new academic year.  It comes as ministers last night admitted they were powerless to force schools to reopen in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.  Schools Minister Nick Gibb said ministers could not 'decree' that schools open, while Dr Mary Bousted, joint head of the NEU, today agreed the government could not 'carry out its threats'.  In a recorded Zoom meeting, seen by the Daily Telegraph, Dr Bousted also told members they could not 'trust' the government's current guidance and called for the decision on bringing all pupils back to be taken locally.  Dr Mary Bousted (pictured), joint head of the National Education Union (NEU), today agreed the government could not 'carry out its threats' to force schools to reopen in September  According to the Telegraph, she told members that it was 'simply impossible' to follow the government's guidance to have all children back in September, adding: 'Local authorities and schools should take the confidence to do what they can do and that will mean for many schools that they cannot have all children fully back in September.  'Now, the Government's making threatening noises about that. But in the end, they won't be able to carry out their threats.'  Dr Bousted's comments come as yesterday, Mr Gibb underlined the government's determination to get all children back in class for the new term, while Labour backed making education of the young generation an 'absolute priority'.  Mr Gibb said that the government planned for all schools to reopen, even in areas such as Manchester, Greater Manchester and Leicester, which have all had local lockdown enforced due to a rise in coronavirus infections.  Mr Gibb told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'What I'm saying is that all children will be returning to school in September, including in those areas that are currently subject to a local lockdown because it is important that children are back in school.  'But you can't decree this for every single case and it will depend on the circumstances of a local increase in the infection rate, and that is why it is being led by the director of public health in localities.  'But we want all children back in school.'  Today sources Department for Education told the Telegraph that getting all children back into schools was a 'national priory' and that, with its guidance, there was 'absolutely no need' for schools to stay shut.  Today sources Department for Education told the Telegraph that getting all children back into schools was a 'national priory' and that, with its guidance, there was 'absolutely no need' for schools to stay shut  They added that, according to a recent polls by Parentkind, 90 per cent of parents supported children going back to school in September.  In June the head of the NEU was blasted for describing the Government's primary school U-turn, which will mean thousands of children missing out on lessons, as a 'win'.  Schools are given the OK to drop poetry from GCSE exams as syllabus is pared back in the wake of coronavirus shutdown Poetry has been dropped as a compulsory topic for GCSE students preparing to sit their exams after months out of school. Exams regulator Ofqual yesterday unveiled a slimmed-down English literature syllabus for 2021 to account for the lost teaching time. For the first time, poetry has been stripped of its core status meaning schools can axe it from their classrooms. All students will be assessed on a Shakespeare play but can choose questions from two of the three other sections - poetry, a 19th century novel and post-1914 British fiction or drama. Many schools are likely to ditch poetry, which lots of children struggle to grasp. Ofqual embraced the flexibility after pressure from teachers grappling with a wide-ranging syllabus in a tight time-frame. Advertisement  Kevin Courtney, the joined head of the NEU, made the comment after Education Secretary Gavin Williamson shelved plans for all primary pupils to return to class before the summer holiday.  The two metre social distancing rule and guidelines on having classes of no more than 15 students in a room made a full return impossible, the minister admitted in June.  The decision means parents across the country are having to home-school and care for their children, often while also working full time, until September.  But Mr Courtney sparked outrage when he responded on Twitter with a message which said: 'This is a win for science and for every National Education Union member who wrote to their MP or local councillor and especially for every National Education Union rep, Covid rep or checklist monitor who was discussing social distancing with their head teacher.'  The comment was attacked by Tory Ipswich MP Tom Hunt, who sits on the Education Select Committee, who told the Telegraph in June: 'The fact that most children will not return until September should sadden us all ... This is not something to congratulate or give yourself a pat on the back for.'  The Government's long-stated 'ambition' was to see all primary children return for at least a month before the end of the academic year but unions and councils said school buildings would have had to double in size to make that happen.  Smaller classes and social distancing requirements forced the Education Secretary into a rethink as Mr Williams later conceded 'we are not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer'.  He said large schools which do have space to bring back more pupils should still open as he promised all children will be back in the classroom in England in September.  Since then the government has been working on plans to reopen schools at the start of the usual academic year.  Smaller classes and social distancing requirements forced the Education Secretary into a rethink as Mr Williams in June conceded 'we are not able to welcome all primary children back for a full month before the summer'  But scientists have warned that the only way of bringing back schools and avoiding another crisis around Christmas was dramatically to improve the NHS test and trace operation.  In a report this week, researchers at University College London (UCL), working with a team at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), revealed that, if schools do re-open and lockdown is gradually lifted with more people slowly returning to work, a second wave will occur.  Singer Harry Style's old school becomes first in country to make face coverings mandatory Harry Styles's old school has become the first in the country to depart from government guidance and make face masks mandatory when classes resume. Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School in Cheshire unilaterally decided that 'on the balance of probability' students and staff would be safer wearing coverings. Navy blue reusable coverings costing three pounds will be viewed as 'part of the uniform' and be embroidered with the school's initials, which were once displayed by the One Direction singer who grew up in the leafy town. The mandatory use of masks goes beyond the government's coronavirus guidance, which does not compel them to be worn in schools. Downing Street has refused to give ground to intense pressure from Labour and union bosses who called for enforced coverings when children go back to lessons next month. Advertisement  The secondary wave would result in the R rate â the number of people each Covid-19 patient infects â rising above the dreaded number of one.  This could yield a secondary wave of infections 2-2.3 times the size of the first, which has so far killed around 46,201 people.  The peak would come in December, or in February 2021 if schools re-open on just a part-time basis.  Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, study author, said: 'Our results are reflective of a broader loosening of lockdown, rather than the effects of transmission within schools exclusively.'  The study, published today in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health, assumed children were as infectious as adults.  But the results remained true even when the team re-ran the model with the assumption that children and young people were 50 per cent as infectious as adults.  The authors said without improvements in testing it will be 'absolutely essential' to introduce other measures in September to 'mitigate' the effects of schools opening.  This could mean pubs are forced to shut or greater restrictions are placed on people meeting indoors.  The calls were backed by Professor Neil Ferguson - who resigned from the Government's advisory group Sage after breaking lockdown rules - who said there was a 'limit' to what contact tracing could achieve.  He stressed that restricting social contacts between people was the main way to control the spread of the virus, and ministers needed to 'plan for all contingencies' when it came to the reopening of schools.  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think it is important to say that not all schools are the same.  The calls were backed by Professor Neil Ferguson - who resigned from the Government's advisory group Sage after breaking lockdown rules - who said there was a 'limit' to what contact tracing could achieve  'We have a lot of evidence now that primary schools, young children, pose very little risk of transmission.  'I think the concern is with secondary schools, teenagers, further education colleges and universities where the evidence is still not certain, but it looks like older teenagers can transmit just as well as adults.  'The risk then is that big schools, comprehensives, universities, FE colleges, link lots of households together, reconnect the social network which social distancing measures have deliberately disconnected. And that poses a real risk of amplification of transmission, of case numbers going up quite sharply.'  Professor Ferguson said trade-offs will have to be made to keep the virus under control.  Meanwhile, Mr Williamson vowed to get schools fully open in September yesterday after a poll found most mothers are confident their children will be safe.  The Education Secretary insisted the Government will 'succeed' in its pledge to return all pupils to classes thanks to the determination of parents.  He said the return was 'our national priority' and warned that not doing so would 'fail our children'.  Just 3 per cent of mothers are worried that classrooms will be risky, while only 7 per cent are concerned that coronavirus measures will be upsetting for children, a survey for Mumsnet found.  Last night Mr Williamson said: 'Before the summer holidays over 1.6million pupils were back in our schools, and it is our national priority to get all children back in the classroom in September.  'Schools are where our children belong â not just for their education, but also for their wellbeing and to be with their fellow pupils and teachers.  'That is why we are helping schools to prepare for all children to return in a few weeks' time. Surveys show parents are increasingly confident that is the right thing to do.  'We will succeed thanks to that same determination to get many pupils back during the last few months and thousands of heads, teachers and school staff across the country are making preparations to welcome the return of all pupils. Because to do any less would be to fail our children.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599185/Teaching-union-threatens-schools-shut-September.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,8485a57963c7758d8971ed7e70dd3403a339d3c9aee2d07732778a2f6a2b9126,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Around 50 million Chinese-made FFP2 masks supplied by Ayanda Capital had ear straps rather than head straps, which raised 'concern' they may not provide an 'adequate fixing' around the face.  The private equity company was handed a Â£252million contract overall to provide personal equipment (PPE) brokered by Andrew Mills, an adviser to Trade Secretary Liz Truss and the Board of Trade - and a senior board adviser at Ayanda.  Ayanda Capital also supplied 150 million masks of another type, which the Government says are unaffected but will be subject to further testing in the UK before any are released for use in the NHS.  Papers supporting a judicial review of the contract against Health Secretary Matt Hancock, brought by the Good Law Project (GLP), notes: 'It is common ground that Ayanda had no prior experience of supplying PPE or indeed and goods or health-related services'.  They went on to allege Mr Mill 'requested' the firm got the contract instead of his own company, Prospermill Ltd, which was set up in February last year with assets of just Â£100 and had no facilities to handle foreign payments.  'Against that background, the value of the contract awarded to Ayanda without competition - Â£252million - is staggering', the GLP document written by QC Jason Coppel noted.  'A substantial portion of the masks purchased under the contract - the FFP2 masks - have been determined by the defendant (Mr Hancock) to be not fit for purpose and will not be used in the NHS.'  Around 43 million Chinese-made FFP2 masks supplied by Ayanda Capital were found to have ear straps rather than head straps, which raised 'concern' they may not provide an 'adequate fixing' for doctors and nurses in high risk wards  Documents supporting a judicial review of the contract, brought by the Good Law Project, run by Jolyon Maugham (above) notes: 'It is common ground that Ayanda had no prior experience of supplying PPE or indeed and goods or health-related services'.  Rachel Reeves MP, shadow chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said: 'The Conservative Government failed in their duty to fully protect those working on the frontline during those crucial early months of this pandemic.  'It is astounding that ministers allowed the national PPE stockpile to run down and then spent millions with an offshore finance company with no history of providing vital equipment for the NHS.  'Many health and care workers experienced inadequate protection, relied on community donations and even bought their own PPE from DIY shops.  'Ministers repeatedly assured the country that things were fine, yet lives of health workers were lost, the infection was spread in health settings while all that time masks bought by the Government could not be used for their intended purpose.  'The case for the National Audit Office to investigate the Conservative Government's mishandling of PPE is overwhelming and as well as apologise, ministers must urgently learn lessons to save lives in the future.'  Ayala is owned by the Horlick family via 'an entity in Mauritius', the documents claim.  Its website says: 'We are a London-based family office focused on a broad investment strategy. We specialise in currency trading, offshore property, private equity and trade financing.'  Its chief executive Tim Horlick told the Times that the Government ministers asked to change the order at a 'late stage in our contract ... to headbands from early loop design [and] we are working with [the Department of Health and Social Care] to try to assist them with this matter'.  The Government disclosed in court papers that the original approach to sell the masks came from Mr Mills. Prospermill had secured exclusive rights to the full production capacity of a large factory in China to produce masks and offered a large quantity almost immediately.  But the legal document revealed Mr Mills requested DHSC's contractual counterparty should be Ayanda rather than Prospermill, as Ayanda already had an established international banking infrastructure that could be used to effect the necessary payments overseas, whereas Prospermill's own bank had indicated it could take some time to set this up on its own account.  Jolyon Maugham, director of the Good Law Project, said: 'Good Law Project wrote to Government on three contracts each worth over a hundred million pounds - with respectively a pest control company, a confectioner and a family hedge fund.  'Each of those contracts has revealed real cause for alarm - including, on Ayanda, that around Â£150 million was spent on unusable masks. What other failures remain undiscovered?'  The Department of Health's own submission to the judicial review admits that there was a problem with the FFP2 masks from Ayanda and other companies it contracted for supplies.  'Some of the masks DHSC had puchased (including the Ayanda FFP2 masks) have ear-loop fastenings rather than head loops, and there was a concern as to whether the former still provided an adequate fixing, notwithstanding that head loops are not a requirement of the relevant FFP2 technical standard ... and are accepted by other countries.  'To that end, further production of of all ear-looped FFP2 masks has been paused, and these will no longer be recommended for purchase or included in the essential specifications.  'No final decision has yet been taken about the ear-looped FFP2 masks that have been supplied so far, but we can confirm they will not be used int he NHS.'  Liberal Democrat health spokeswoman Munira Wilson said: 'The news that 50million masks are not safe for our NHS and care staff to use is yet another staggering error made by this Government.  'Not only does it mean millions of pounds of taxpayers money being thrown down the drain, but it shows just how Ministers are playing fast and loose when it comes to keeping our NHS staff safe.  'The Government's procurement of personal protective equipment has been shocking from the very beginning of the pandemic. It should not need to be said that Ministers should prioritise protecting the staff in our health service from the virus over awarding Government contracts to their friends.  'It is clear that Boris Johnson's Government are still failing to get a grip on the coronavirus crisis. An inquiry into their handling of the pandemic must begin now, so that they can learn from their mistakes before more lives are put at risk.'

The child, who is known as AH, died in a hospice in April 2019 following a cardiac arrest three weeks after the accident at their Norfolk home.  The incident that prompted 999 emergency crews to visit the home prompted a criminal investigation, which has since been concluded.  Details of the death follow the publication of a serious case review into the tragedy, which detailed a series of concerns:  The home, in a 'socially deprived area', was in 'absolute squalor'  Rooms were 'cluttered' and had an unpleasant odour from the stained carpets and piles of unwashed clothing  Cleaning crew removed 45 bags of unwashed clothing from the scene.  There was 'often no food in the house' and children were 'sore' from being left in soiled nappies  The review into the child's death has called for agencies protecting children to evaluate guidance on the safe usage of stair-gates, but said that 'used in the right circumstances, there is no doubt that stair-gates save lives'.  The report, by the Norfolk Safeguarding Children Partnership (NSCP), said that the accident on April 3, 2019, took place while AH and three of their five siblings were at home.  It stated: 'Child AH was found trapped in the gap between the original stair-gate and one added to prevent the children climbing over the lower one.'  A four-year-old child died after being trapped between two stair-gates, it has been revealed (file photo)  The family's other children have now gone into foster care or are being looked after by the council.  The report found a number of 'concerns about neglect' were known about by agencies during Child AH and their siblings' lives.  The police who responded to the 999 call said the home, which was in a 'socially deprived area' was in 'absolute squalor'.  The report found the house, which was cleaned following the accident, was described as 'cluttered with an unpleasant odour from the stained carpets and piles of unwashed clothing'.  It also said: 'Forty-five bags of dirty washing were removed by the cleaning company.'  The children had never been subject to child protection or children in need plans, but shortly before the accident the family had been referred to family support services, after issues were raised by a health visitor.  The report found that the home, which was said to be 'cluttered', had 'deteriorated' between January and April 2019.  It stated: 'AH was reported to have worn the same clothes all week... he was not toilet trained and not always cleaned after soiling his nappy.'  A stair-gate was installed due to concerns about a child climbing on upstairs windowsills.  This was described as 'unsafe', with 'the children climbing over it' and 'trying to force it open'.  In March, the health visitor raised several concerns, including 'the filthy condition of the home and garden, the safety of the children, and the risks presented by the stair-gate'.  Chris Robson, Norfolk Safeguarding Children Partnership chairman said AH's mother was seeking to protect her children by installing the gates. Pictured: Norfolk County Council  This led to the referral for family support, just days before the accident and Child AH's subsequent death.  But it was found the family did not meet the threshold for a social work assessment.  The report found there were indicators of neglect, including there being 'often no food in the house', children being left in soiled nappies and 'sore', and the accident ahead of Child AH's death occurring when the children were unsupervised by a parent or appropriate adult.  However, the children were said to be 'happy, lively and resilient' with a 'warm relationship with their mother who clearly loved them very much and took a pride in their achievements'.  Professionals felt AH's mother was 'overwhelmed by demands of a big family, a low income and no friends or family support'.  Chris Robson, NSCP chairman, said: 'This was a tragic accident and the thoughts of the whole partnership are with AH's family and friends.  'AH's mother was seeking to protect him by installing these gates and there is no doubt that she loved her children very much.  'The review recommends multi-agency work to review the published risks of using stair-gates so that parents and carers know when and how to use them safely.  'However, despite the absolute tragedy of AH's death, I would not want to deter anyone from installing a gate to stop small children from accessing the stairs.  'Used in the right circumstances, there is no doubt that stair-gates save lives.'  The review, which was published on August 5, was commissioned last year to look at how well agencies worked together and to identify any learning that could lead to improving safeguarding practice.  Six recommendations were made, including promoting training on isolation and links to depression, and reviewing neglect risk assessment tools.  Mr Robson added: 'There are always things we can learn from any tragedy and, in this case, more could have been done to look at the wider family network. As a partnership, we welcome the recommendations of the review.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599299/Child-four-died-trapped-two-stair-gates.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,85876a45eb1536b37008b8df059e032d7ba0b270b6f610b53b11e690cd55f455,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The man was standing on a riverbank fishing for salmon, in a remote part of Alaska when the terrifying encounter with nature happened.  A video shows the bear approaching the man from the shallow water, coming within a few feet of him.  The video shows the bear approaching the man in the shallow water, who has a salmon caught on the end of his fishing line in remote park of Alaska  The fisherman, who has his line cast out with a salmon hooked on the end, remains still as the bear comes closer.  The animal then appears to change its mind, and runs back towards the woods, before suddenly turning around again.  It approaches the man once more, heading towards the salmon which is floundering in the shallows.  The man crouches down as the hungry bear pounces on the salmon and pulls it off the fisherman's line  With the stolen fish firmly in his mouth, the bear makes a break for the woods to eat its dinner  The woman who is videoing the footage breathes a nervous sigh and says: 'Oh my god, it stresses me out.'  The hungry bear pounces, grabbing the salmon with both front paws, before snatching it in its mouth and pulling it off the fisherman's line.  It runs off into the woods to eat its catch of the day - albeit a stolen one.  The fisherman, now empty handed, runs back towards the onlookers as they laugh with relief.  The man and his companions, who captured the encounter on video, laugh with relief following the hairy exchange  The video was captured on July 26 and was published online recently with the caption: 'While fishing for sockeye salmon in remote Alaska a brown bear took my catch.

Experts from the University of Zurich examined 700,000 plant specimens from the southwestern Pacific island as part of a study into its ecosystem diversity.  Two-thirds of the species of plants found on New Guinea by the research team are only found in that region - an area almost 20 times the size of Switzerland.  The island has lowland jungles and high altitude grasslands with peaks bigger than Mont Blanc in France and among them they found 13,634 unique plant species.  Experts from the University of Zurich examined 700,000 plant specimens from the southwestern Pacific island of New Guinea (pictured) as part of a study into its ecosystem  Botanists have long known that this mega-diverse wilderness area is home to a large number of plant species and this new study proves the long-held theory.  Since the 17th century scientists all over the world have worked to identify and name thousands of plants collected in New Guinea - but they have worked independently.  The fact they worked alone meant uncertainty surrounded the exact number of plant species, with conflicting estimates ranging from 9,000 to 25,000.  Rodrigo CÃ¡mara-Leret, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Zurich (UZH) Department of Evolutionary Biology and Environmental Studies, led the new study.  'Compared to other areas like Amazonia, for which plant checklists were recently published, New Guinea remained the 'Last Unknown',' he said.  Under his lead, 99 scientists from 56 institutions and 19 countries the first expert-verified checklist for the 13,634 vascular plant species of New Guinea.  They started by compiling a list of plant names from online catalogues, institutional repositories and datasets curated by taxonomists.  After standardising the scientific names, experts on New Guinea flora checked almost 25,000 species names derived from over 700,000 individual specimens.  For this, they reviewed the list of original names in their plant family of expertise and assessed whether these names were correctly assigned in the online platforms.  Finally, an independent comparison was performed between the list accepted by experts and a list contained in Plants of the World Online for New Guinea.  The resulting checklist contains 13,634 plants - showing that New Guinea has the world's richest island flora, the team explained.  By far the most species-rich family are the orchids and almost a third of the species listed as unique to the island were trees.  One particularly remarkable finding is that 68 per cent of the plants are endemic and are only found in that region, which is 'unmatched in tropical Asia'.  'It means that Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, the two states into which the island is divided, have a unique responsibility for the survival of this irreplaceable biodiversity,' said CÃ¡mara-Leret.  The new checklist will improve the accuracy of biogeographic and ecological studies, help focus DNA sequencing on species-rich groups with high endemism and help with the discovery of more species by taxonomists, researchers said.  The island has lowland jungles and high altitude grasslands with peaks bigger than Mont Blanc in France and among them they found 13,634 unique plant species including the Musa Ingens (left) and Nepenthes biak (right)  Thousands of specimens remain unidentified in the collections and many unknown species have yet to be discovered in the wild, according to scientists.  Michael Kessler, study co-author and scientific curator of the Botanical Garden of the University of Zurich, said another 4,000 species will be added within 50 years.  These efforts will be important for conservation planning and looking at the impact of changes in climate and land use, experts believe.  Policy-wise, the study shows that long-term institutional and financial support is critical if significant advances are to be made over the next decades.  CÃ¡mara-Leret said the work proves international collaborative efforts using verified digital data can rapidly synthesise biodiversity information.  'This can serve as a model for accelerating research in other hyper-diverse areas such as Borneo,' the researcher explained.  'Such initiatives pave the way for the grand challenge of conserving the richest island flora of the world.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-8599615/New-Guinea-greatest-variety-plants-island-world.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,4d50ec9d7c643a32dc8dc73a650ef5de6d26406f6154f2b991fd281d2061d379,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance, a Democrat, sent a subpoena last year to Deutsche Bank as part of its investigation into TrumpÂ´s business dealings, the New York Times reported Wednesday, citing four people familiar with the inquiry.  The bank complied with the subpoena, turning over records including financial statements Trump gave the bank when he was borrowing money, two of those people told the Times.  New York Attorney General Letitia James, also a Democrat, also subpoenaed the bank for records related to Trump last year following Michael Cohen's testimony.  Scroll down for video  The office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance (above) sent a subpoena last year to Deutsche Bank as part of its investigation into TrumpÂ´s business dealings  New York Attorney General Letitia James (above), a Democrat, also subpoenaed the bank for records related to Trump last year following CohenÂ´s testimony  On Wednesday night, James' office said she will deliver a 'major national announcement' on Thursday at 11.30am.  The subject of the announcement was not immediately clear, and it may be unrelated to the widening criminal probe into Trump's business practices.  Vance, a Democrat, this week suggested a grand jury subpoena for Trump's tax returns was part of an investigation of 'possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization,' including alleged insurance and bank fraud.  Vance's investigation into Trump and the Trump Organization was spurred by disclosures of hush payments to two women who said they had had sexual relationships with Trump before he became president. Trump has denied the claims.  Vance's office declined to comment on the New York Times report. Attorneys for Trump and for Deutsche Bank didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.  The Manhattan prosecutor, who is a Democrat, was among several authorities in New York who launched investigations last year after TrumpÂ´s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, told congress that the president had a practice of misleading business associates and tax officials about the value of his assets.  Prosecutors in New York are conducting a criminal probe into Trump's business dealings  Vance hasn't disclosed details about his probe, but his lawyers told a federal judge this week that it was a 'complex financial investigation' that followed public reports of 'extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization.'  As part of the investigation, Vance asked TrumpÂ´s accountants to turn over eight years of his personal and corporate tax records. The accounting firm has yet to comply as Trump and Vance have battled in court over the validity of the subpoena.  Other investigators have requested records from Deutsche Bank, which was one of the few banks willing to lend to Trump after a series of corporate bankruptcies starting in the early 1990s.  Trump addressed the case at a White House press briefing on Monday, saying 'This is just a continuation of the witch hunt.'  Manhattan district attorney Cyrus Vance (pictured) hasn't disclosed details about his probe, but his lawyers told a federal judge this week that it was a 'complex financial investigation' that followed public reports of 'extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization'  'Itâs Democrat stuff they failed with Mueller they failed with everything,' Trump said, referencing Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, which generally confined itself to allegations of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russians. The report preceded a failed Democratic impeachment effort.  'They failed at every stage of the game,' Trump said. 'Even before I got in this was starting with the Mueller deal. Mueller started a little bit after,' Trump corrected himself. Mueller was appointed after former Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation in 2017.  Trump also said he was barely familiar with the matter, which was reported in the New York Times and a variety of outlets as a court filing was made public.  'Thereâs nothing that I know even about it,' Trump said. 'I said whatâs this all about? I know nothing about it.'  'Itâs a terrible thing that they do. Itâs really a terrible thing. The witch hunt has gone on long enough,' he said.  Two congressional committees, both controlled by Democrats, subpoenaed the bank for documents related to Trump, who sued to block their release.  Trump has said the investigations are all politically motivated. Earlier this week, he called VanceÂ´s investigation 'a continuation of the witch hunt.'  After Trump's shock election victory in 2016, his relationship with Deutsche Bank has attracted scrutiny from lawmakers.  The House Financial Services Committee has examined possible money laundering in US property deals involving Trump.  The House Intelligence Committee has investigated whether Trumpâs dealings left him vulnerable to the influence of foreign individuals or governments.  The two committees issued subpoenas in April 2019 requiring Deutsche Bank to hand over the banking records of Trump, his children and his businesses.  Deutsche Bank reportedly complied with the subpoena, turning over records including financial statements Trump gave the bank when he was borrowing money  Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors in New York could seek Trump's financial records from lenders including Deutsche Bank.  It is part of a criminal investigation that began in 2018 into Trump and the Trump Organization, the presidentâs family real estate business, spurred by disclosures of hush payments made to two women who said they had past sexual relationships with him - pornographic film actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal.  Trump and his aides have denied the relationships.  Investigators hope the records will reveal whether there are any financial links between Trump and Russiaâs government, sources familiar with the probe have said.  Sources within Deutsche Bank have denied any Russian connections to Trump loans.  At the time he became president in January 2017, Trump owed the bank around $350 million, according to sources.  The Financial Services Committee also issued a subpoena to Capital One, which had maintained a long-term relationship with Trump and has been scrutinized for some of its business practices.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8598501/New-York-prosecutors-got-Donald-Trumps-records-Deutsche-Bank-widening-probe.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,4705de92b2fdfb22953f7b8047267154f3b4bda2579151c5c89e2a14bf4a36ae,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Received Pronunciation, as spoken by royals and other members of the upper classes, was found to be strongly associated with intelligence, sophistication and charm.  By contrast, Cornish was rated the least attractive accent, although it was associated with a good sense of humour.  And Spanish and French accents do not fare particularly well either, ranking 18th and 19th respectively for attractiveness.  The Queen's English, or Received Pronunciation, was the most desirable accent as listeners associated it with intelligence, while the Edinburgh accent was a close second for the UK.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock last month ordered an urgent review into how daily death counts are calculated in England because of a 'statistical flaw'.  Academics found a glitch in Public Health England's methods that meant ministers counted victims as anyone who died after ever testing positive for Covid-19 â even if they were hit by a bus after beating the disease months later.  It would've meant that, technically, no-one could ever recover from the virus and all 265,000 of England's confirmed patients would eventually have had their deaths attributed to the disease.  The blunder could see up to 4,000 deaths removed from England's official toll of 41,749, according to reports. One of the leading experts who uncovered the flaw told MailOnline his 'best guess' was that more than 1,000 people have had their deaths wrongly recorded as caused by Covid-19.  Mr Hancock is set to bring the figures in line with Scotland and Northern Ireland, which only attribute deaths to Covid-19 if it occurs within a month of their diagnosis.  The Health Secretary is expected to announce the new measurement by the end of the week following the two-week review into the counting fiasco.  The statistical flaw was uncovered by Oxford University's Professor Carl Heneghan and Dr Yoon Loke, from the University of East Anglia.  Professor Heneghan, director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the prestigious university, told the Sun: 'It is a sensible decision. There is no point attributing deaths to Covid 28 days after infection.  The statistical flaw was uncovered by Oxford University's Professor Carl Heneghan  WHAT OTHER BLUNDERS HAVE PHE MADE IN THE COVID CRISIS? Public Health England has come under fire for the way it has handled the UK's coronavirus testing system, for which it was responsible at the start of the Covid-19 crisis. Its directors have tried to divert blame, explaining that major decisions are taken by Government ministers in the Department of Health, but the body has been accused of being controlling. These are some of the mis-steps for which PHE has been blamed: Test and trace stopped on March 12 On March 12 the Government announced it would no longer test everybody who was thought to have coronavirus, and it would stop tracking the contacts of cases to try and stop the spread of the disease. As a result, Britain effectively stopped tracking the virus and it was allowed to spiral out of control. It didn't have the capacity to test the number of people who were catching the virus, officials have since admitted. Conservative MP David Davis today said that was 'precisely the wrong thing to do'. Professor Yvonne Doyle, PHE's medical director, told MPs in May: 'It was a decision that was come to because of the sheer scale of cases in the UK'. Insufficient contact tracing capacity Papers published by Government scientists on SAGE revealed that PHE only had enough contact tracing capacity to last two weeks in the event of a virus outbreak. PHE experts themselves said in February that capacity should be increased immediately but admitted it could only be expanded about 10-fold, to contact 8,000 people per day, which still wouldn't be enough. The paper warned: 'Where cases of higher generational numbers become predominant CCI is expected to be of limited benefit outside of certain special cases and should be discontinued.' Pledged antibody tests in March PHE's Professor Sharon Peacock said on March 25 that the UK was on course to have antibody tests available to the public that month. She confirmed the Government had bought 3.5million of the tests and was evaluating their quality. They could be available to the public 'within days', she said at a Downing Street briefing. Three months later, however, and they are still not a reality. Officials have since decided there are no tests good enough available, and there is no proof that the results will be of any use to the public. Testing efforts slowed by centralised lab approach Scientists in private labs, universities and research institutes across the country said in April that their offers to help with coronavirus testing had fallen on deaf ears. PHE was pressing ahead with a 'centralised' model of testing in which only its own eight laboratories and some in NHS hospitals were being used to analyse tests. 'Little ship' labs, of which there are hundreds around the country, had the tools to process tests and could have increased testing capacity rapidly if officials had agreed to work with them, they said. But it took Britain until the end of April to manage more than 100,000 tests in a day, while Germany had been managing the feat for weeks by utilising private laboratories.

'But if it's someone who picked up the virus in a care home in March and recovered, and last week died of a heart attack, what does that actually tell us?'  Professor Heneghan said the 28 day measure employed by the rest of the UK allowed experts to compare the outbreak on previous months with more precision, which helps inform policymakers about what steps need to be taken.  He added: 'If deaths are going down, great. And if they are up, then we need to act. But at the moment, the figures are just confusing.'  The Office for National Statistics, another Government agency, also records Covid-19 deaths, and is considered the most reliable source.  The ONS â which is not affected by the counting method â has confirmed at least 51,596 people have died in England and Wales up to July 24.  Its calculations are based on death certificates with Covid-19 as a suspected contributor.  Public Health England told MailOnline last month that the World Health Organization has not defined a time limit for counting a death as caused by Covid-19, and said it 'continues to keep this under review'.  It admitted that a coronavirus death is one that happens to anyone who has previously tested positive, regardless of how long ago the test happened. It said the 'vast majority' of Covid-19 deaths were correctly identified.  Dr Loke added at the time: 'This statistical flaw arose because PHE chose a quick and easy technique.  'Their statistical method is reasonably accurate at the beginning of the pandemic, when there were not yet many people in the community who had survived Covid.  'However, PHE did not â and have not yet â realised that glaring inaccuracies arise when tens of thousands of frail older people are discharged from hospital, and these Covid survivors unfortunately die from other, non-Covid related causes.'  Ministers are thought to be planning a huge reform of PHE following a series of failings by the beleaguered agency during the crisis.  PHE was blamed for the initially chaotic coronavirus testing regime as well as the decision made early in the epidemic to abandon widespread tracking of the virus.  The move was seen by many scientists as one of the central mistakes in Britain's handling of the pandemic. The UK has the highest number of coronavirus deaths in Europe.  PHE â an executive agency of the Department of Health â was also criticised for refusing the offer of help from universities and private labs to carry out tests.  The Prime Minister has not named PHE specifically, but he told the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs in May that he was planning a review of 'a number of institutions' after the pandemic is over.  The health secretary last month admitted that he didn't realise what the agency's limits were until the crisis exposed them.  Speaking to a committee of MPs, Mr Hancock was pressed on whether he was reforming PHE.  He said: 'There will be a time for that. My priority now is on controlling the virus and preparing for winter... we need a public health agency that isn't only brilliant at science but also able to go to scale quickly.'  Meanwhile, the UK recorded another 65 coronavirus deaths yesterday â taking the official number of victims in Britain to 46,364.  Around 58 Brits are now succumbing to the life-threatening infection each day, on average.  The deaths data does not represent how many Covid-19 patients died within the last 24 hours â it is only how many fatalities have been reported and registered with the authorities.  And the figure does not always match updates provided by the home nations. Department of Health officials work off a different time cut-off, meaning daily updates from Scotland and Northern Ireland are out of sync.  The count announced by NHS England every afternoon, which only takes into account deaths in hospitals, does not match up with the DH figures because they work off a different recording system.  For instance, some deaths announced by NHS England bosses will have already been counted by the Department of Health, which records fatalities 'as soon as they are available'.  But the fatality curve is no longer flattening as quickly as it was, with the rolling seven-day average number of daily deaths having been in the sixties since July 18.  It can take infected patients several weeks to die, meaning any spike in deaths won't be immediately apparent in government figures.  It is currently impossible to know how many of the deaths announced by the Department of Health were not actually caused directly by Covid-19.  Separate figures â released on Tuesday â revealed overall deaths in England and Wales are still below the number usually expected at this time of year, based on an average from the previous five years.  Department of Health bosses say 820 Britons are now being struck down with the life-threatening virus every day, on average. The rate has been rising since dropping to a four-month low of 546 on July 8.  The figures add to mounting fears of a second wave in Britain, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson understood to be 'extremely concerned' about cases bubbling up in the UK and in other European nations that have relaxed tough lockdown measures. France today warned it could lose control of Covid-19 'at any moment'.  But the number of patients being admitted to hospital has yet to spike, bolstering claims from top scientists that the outbreak is not getting worse and cases are only rising because more patients are being tested.  Just 109 coronavirus patients were admitted for NHS care across the UK on August 2 â a figure which has barely changed throughout July. During the darkest days of Britain's crisis in April, around 3,500 patients were needing hospital treatment every day.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599213/Thousands-Covid-19-deaths-wiped-governments-official-toll-counting-fiasco.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,d11ffb7849992d779bfd25abc8b30a956e1cef0a58571ff6c42f72bbd087b623,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Henry Long, 19, and 18-year-olds Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers were sentenced at the Old Bailey on Friday for manslaughter after PC Harper was killed last year.  PC Harper, died horrifically on August 15 last year after he tried to stop the trio fleeing after they stole a quad bike in Stanford Dingley, Berkshire but his ankle got caught in a strap dangling from the back of a Seat Toledo and he was dragged to his death.  Long was sentenced to 16 years, while Cole and Bowers were each handed 13-year terms. The family said they were let down by the 'unduly lenient' sentences'.  PC Harper's bereaved mother, Debbie Adlam, 53, has launched a new 'Andrew's Law' campaign for a mandatory 20 year sentence for those convicted of killing police officers.  Appearing by video link from her home in Oxfordshire on Good Morning Britain she slammed the killers for 'laughing and joking' in court and said if her son was alive he would 'fully support' the campaign.

Henry Long (left), 19, and 18-year-olds Jessie Cole (centre) and Albert Bowers (right) were sentenced at the Old Bailey on Friday for manslaughter  Asked if she would have felt different if the accused showed some remorse during the trial, she told Good Morning Britain: 'I think I would, we've watched them laughing, joking.  'Because of the situation with Covid things were laid out separately to the normal situation in a court room so we were sat for quite a long time sat with them on a video screen opposite where we were sat and they were joking and laughing and talking to each other and their microphones weren't even switched on.  'Which I don't really understand how that's appropriate. If you are in a murder trial how the suspects don't have to sit there and listen to at least what there saying and doing while we are sat listening to their hideous crimes. I didn't see any remorse. '  This week the Attorney General's Office confirmed they have been asked to consider if the jail terms handed down are too lenient.  Mrs Adlam welcomed the decision this week, and this morning said she couldn't understand why reductions were taken off the sentences for her sons killers.  Appearing by video link from her home in Oxfordshire on Good Morning Britain she slammed the killers for 'laughing and joking' in court and said if her son was alive he would 'fully support' the campaign  She said: 'I think personally speaking the initial sentence was not so much my issue. When I saw the reductions coming off of these sentences it was then becoming unbelievable how much was taken off.  'It just didn't make any sense to me because an early plea for something when you're really in a position where you've got no choice other than to admit you've done it because its been proven to you thats one thing and then the age issue is a big problem for me.  'And this is part of the reason that we are launching Andrew's Law and we are blown away with the response so far.'  PC Harper's widow Lissie had expressed bitter disappointment her husband's killers were cleared of murder and instead found guilty of manslaughter.

Call centre staff trying to reach people who have come into contact with positive coronavirus cases say many people ignore their calls because the 0300 prefix is often used by cold callers.  The Local Government Association is now calling for staff to go out 'on the ground' in local areas to speak to people who are not being reached.  The NHS Test and Trace system is being hampered by its use of 0300 numbers frequently used by cold callers. Boris Johnson has called the system 'world beating'  This week researchers reported that only half of contacts were being traced through the scheme, which is well short of the 80 per cent target scientists say is needed for it to be effective.  The LGA said today: âFor some hard to reach people, answering the phone can bring problems being chased for a debt or faced with language difficulties.  'We would encourage anyone called by the 0300 013 5000 number to answer and do their bit to help defeat this virus.  'But it is also crucial that missed calls can be followed up on the ground by public health experts experienced in contact tracing.'  Meanwhile, Labour's health spokesman, Jonathan Ashworth, called for a radical overhaul of the scheme and for local authorities to be put 'in the driving seat'.  'The problem with the national system, where you effectively get a call from a 0300 number from a call centre run by an outsource company like Serco, is that they are not as effective as the on the ground authority,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  A growing number of town halls are setting up their own 'test and trace' systems amid growing disillusionment at the official scheme - despite the government's insistence it is working effectively.  Calderdale Council in West Yorkshire announced plans to establish a localised model, just days after Blackburn with Darwen Council said it was doing the same.  On Tuesday Kirklees Council, also in West Yorkshire, said it was investigating setting up its own Covid scheme to help reach communities who do not speak English.  Why do cold callers (and the government) use 0300 numbers? 0300 numbers are the same across the UK and not linked to any geographical area. This is attractive to businesses - or government organisations - who want a single national contact number. They are also usually charged at a standard network rate, which makes them affordable for most people on standard mobile or landline plans. The number for test and trace is 0300 0135000. Advertisement  It follows growing anger over the official NHS Test and Trace scheme, which is supposed to track down contacts of those who test positive for coronavirus and encourage them to self-isolate for two weeks.  Despite being described by Boris Johnson as 'world-beating', the national scheme has been beset by delays and has failed to track down hundreds of contacts.  And although thousands of contact tracers have been employed, many have been left with no work to do.  Sandwell Council in the West Midlands became the first to set up its own system last week.  The latest town halls to follow suit are in areas of the north of England affected by a mini-lockdown following a spike in infections.  In these districts - parts of Greater Manchester, eastern Lancashire and West Yorkshire - people are banned from different households meeting in a private home or garden.  On Monday, Blackburn with Darwen, in Lancashire, said it was setting up its own scheme because the government programme was 'simply not tracing enough cases and contacts fast enough'.  Under its new model, local teams would track down people who could not be reached by the national system after 48 hours. If local officials still did not make contact after two days, council workers would visit their address to pass on advice and offer support.  The Blackburn model will factor in potential language issues and any other vulnerabilities using the knowledge of community-based teams.  On Tuesday Calderdale Council, which includes Halifax and the surrounding area, said its new system was expected to be in operation 'very soon'.  The LGA called for 'boots on the ground' in local areas to reach those who may feel they are being 'pestered' by cold callers or debt collectors  Council leader Tim Swift said: 'Testing is a really important first line of defence in controlling the spread of COVID-19, and we're working hard to make it easier for more people to get tested in Calderdale.  'We have doubled our local testing in the last week, focusing on areas with the highest infection rates.  'We're working together with other local organisations, including the voluntary sector, to encourage people across our communities to get tested if they have symptoms.'  A similar system could be introduced in neighbouring Kirklees, which covers Dewsbury, Batley and Huddersfield.  Council leader Shabir Pandor said the authority would look 'very seriously' at anything that could help it target action and tackle the virus.  He added: 'Local contact tracing might prove to be effective and, if it is, we will look to implement our own system.'  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: 'NHS Test and Trace is working, with over 2.6 million people tested and more than 218,000 people prevented from unknowingly spreading the virus.  'Every day local authorities receive test, case and contact tracing data, with further data being shared with local Directors of Public Health, to support with their outbreak management responsibilities.  'Our priority is to curb the spread of this virus and save lives.

But before they started filming Surviving the Virus: My Brother And Me in late March, Xand fell ill: it was classic coronavirus, a fever, a hacking cough and a temporary loss of smell.  He isolated at home for two weeks but continued to experience strange symptoms, including breathlessness and heart palpitations. Three weeks later, things became serious. The palpitations worsened, leaving him feeling sick, exhausted and scared.  In the early hours of April 21, Xand travelled to University College Hospital, London, where Chris was working on a Covid-19 ward. Cameras rolled as the brothers were told that the only way to return Xand's heart - which was beating at early three times the normal resting heart rate for a man of his age - to its normal rhythm was by shocking it with a powerful electric current.

But amid the outside skepticism and a stream of North Korean propaganda glorifying its virus efforts, an exchange between Pyongyang and the United Nations is providing new clarity - and actual numbers - about what might be happening in the North, which has closed its borders and cut travel - never a free-flowing stream - by outsider monitors and journalists.  In late July, North Korea said it had imposed its 'maximum emergency system' to guard against the virus spreading after finding a person with COVID-19 symptoms in Kaesong city, near the border with rival South Korea.  State media reported that leader Kim Jong Un then ordered a total lockdown of Kaesong, and said the suspected case was a North Korean who had earlier fled to South Korea before slipping back into Kaesong last month.  North Korea's public admission of its first potential case and the emergency steps it took prompted immediate outside speculation that Pyongyang may be worried about a big outbreak after months of steadfastly claiming it had no cases. Foreign experts are highly skeptical over the North's assertion of no cases, in large part because of its long, porous border with China, where the virus emerged, and its history of hiding past disease outbreaks.  In a report to the World Health Organization obtained by The Associated Press, North Korea said it has quarantined 64 first contacts of the suspected Keasong case and 3,571 secondary contacts in state-run facilities for 40 days, according to Dr. Edwin Salvador, WHO representative to North Korea.  In this photo provided by the North Korean government, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, presides over an executive policy council meeting at the ruling Workers' Party in Pyongyang, North Korea, yesterday. Kim Jong Un directed his government agencies to act immediately to stabilize the livelihoods of residents in a city locked down over coronavirus concerns, state media reported today  This picture taken yesterday and released from North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) today shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (centre, top) and members of the Executive Policy Council of the WPK Central Committee attending a Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) meeting at the office building of the Central Committee of the WPK in Pyongyang  Salvador said in an email to AP that North Korea also informed WHO of the suspected first case, saying that person was tested for COVID-19 but the test results were inconclusive. Salvador said the WHO has requested that North Korea share more information about the person.  Salvador said all North Korea's international borders remain closed, group gatherings are banned, masks are required in public, and all educational institutions, including preschools, are on an extended summer break. Since the end of December, Salvador said North Korea has quarantined and released 25,905 people, 382 of them foreigners.  Many outside observers are all but certain the virus already entered North Korea because it closed the border with China, its biggest trading partner, cme weeks after the world's first known virus cases were recorded in China in December. Monitoring groups in Seoul have steadfastly reported about North Korean virus cases and deaths.  A major coronavirus outbreak may cause a humanitarian disaster because of North Korea's broken public health care system and lack of medical supplies.  But it's unclear how serious the North's current situation is.  'Though a really extensive local outbreak might not have occurred yet, it's likely that a considerable number of people has been infected,' said analyst Hong Min at Seoul's Korea Institute for National Unification. 'Even though North Korea locks itself down, there should be suspected cases there and authorities must aggressively diagnose them. But North Korea has never been transparent about whether it has such a capacity and the will to do so.'  The North's state media have recently churned out articles thick with rallying propaganda that describe the latest anti-virus work as 'an all-people's campaign' that demonstrates the Kim government's resolve to protect public safety 'at any cost.' The articles also say that any individual carelessness or breach of anti-virus guidelines may lead to 'critical consequences.'  Hand clean gels are displayed at the Imjingak Pavilion in Paju, near the border with North Korea, Sunday, July 26, 2020. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un placed the city of Kaesong near the border with South Korea under total lockdown after a person was found with suspected COVID-19 symptoms, saying he believes ""the vicious virus"" may have entered the country, state media reported Sunday  State media said North Korea has deployed more health workers, sanitized personnel and goods, and used loudspeakers to raise public awareness of the virus. The Korean Central News Agency said Thursday that 550,000 aid items have been sent to Kaesong.  North Korea's claimed emergency steps suggest that an outbreak there may have worsened, Kim Sin-gon, a professor at Korea University College of Medicine in Seoul, said. The North may also aim to win aid from South Korea or others, but wants to save face by saying its suspected Kaesong case is someone who had been in South Korea, he said.  Before returning to North Korea, the suspected first case, identified in South Korea as a 24-year-old surnamed Kim, hadn't tested positive in South Korea and never had contact with any patient, South Korean health official Yoon Taeho said.  The motive for his return to North Korea isn't known. More than 33,000 North Koreans have escaped to South Korea over the past 22 years for political and economic reasons, but only a handful of them have returned to North Korea.  Police said the man was questioned in June on an allegation that he had sexually assaulted a fellow female North Korean refugee. The man denied the accusation. Last month, the national forensic service told police it found DNA evidence of the assault, and police were continuing to investigate, according to the Gyeonggi Nambu Provincial Police Agency.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599351/North-Korea-quarantines-thousands-southern-city-locked-coronavirus-worries.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,5efa7ee9ad2e4398ce474422b5d67a6cd7497fa1b72a80de8fc10af894dbef03,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

An independent inquiry set up three and a half years ago has still not finished.  And the former Crewe Alexandra and Bury defender says it is an 'absolute disgrace' that he and other victims are still waiting to see the report, which was ordered on the back of his harrowing disclosures.  Andy Woodward has slammed the fact he and other victims are still waiting for the FA's report  The FA commissioned the investigation into historic child sex abuse within the sport in December 2016. The probe, led by Clive Sheldon QC, has been hit by a number of delays.  Legal issues have had an impact but the guilty plea of paedophile Barry Bennell â Woodward's abuser â last week appeared to have removed the final barrier.  However, Woodward and others are still waiting to see the report's contents, and the 46-year-old told Sportsmail he is tired of the delays.  'It's an absolute disgrace,' he said. 'Lots of the victims were dragged to London to see Sheldon. I was grilled for four and a half hours, thrown out and then nothing. We have been left high and dry.'  The report was set up to review how abusers such as Bennell carried out their crimes undetected. It is expected to have examined whether concerns were raised and, if so, what was done about them.  The guilty plea of paedophile Barry Bennell (above) appeared to have removed the final barrier  Manchester City, one of the clubs where Bennell worked, set up their own inquiry. They have issued face-to-face apologies to more than 20 survivors, and have made a number of compensation payments. But there is no sign of Sheldon's report.  'I would have thought that as soon as Bennell pleaded guilty they would have been ready to press the button,' said Woodward. 'While legal issues may have stopped publication, it should not have stopped the inquiry itself.  'The last contact I had with them was to complain about a transcript of the interview I'd done with them because it was heavily edited and had missed a lot of the important points.'  Woodward believes that until the report is published, a number of questions will remain unanswered.  'We want to know what happened,' he said. 'We want clarity and we want to know if further action is needed. You would have thought that they would have been working tirelessly in the background and should be ready to go.'  Bennell's abuse victim Woodward (left) outside Chester Crown Court back in 2014  Bennell, serving a 31-year sentence after being convicted of 50 child sexual offences, pleaded guilty to a further nine offences against two victims at Chester Crown Court last week. He is due to be sentenced in October.  'I feel like I have beaten him now,' Woodward said. 'He is a broken man, I have broken him.'  An FA spokesperson said: 'The independent review by Clive Sheldon QC is currently ongoing, so we are not in a position to comment further at this time.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-8597493/FA-sex-abuse-report-delay-disgrace-says-victim-Andy-Woodward.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,5192a89ed063604ca5737d4854d738057a783e732d3e679b70e67c07eb7918e5,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The 40-year-old star relies on a combination of boxing, hiking, battle ropes and stair climbing to shed the unwanted kilos, as well a diet called the 'Mayr Method' - which requires chewing every mouthful of food 40 times.  Dietitian Kate Save told Daily Mail Australia that she estimates Rebel has lost about 18kg already, or 2.8 stone.  So what are the actress' effective weight-loss methods?  Actress Rebel Wilson has offered a glimpse at some of the things she has been doing to get fit and lose weight, after she dubbed 2020 her 'year of health' (pictured with her personal trainer)  The 40-year-old star from Sydney relies on a combination of boxing, hiking, battle ropes and stair climbing to shed the unwanted kilos (pictured in May 2019)  The first thing Rebel (pictured) has adopted is lifting heavy weights, which is said to torch fat and quickly hone and tone your physique. She can regularly be seen flipping tyres  1. She lifts heavy weights  The main technique Rebel has adopted is lifting heavy weights, which torch fat and quickly hone and tone your physique.  The actress can often be seen flipping tyres and pulling heavy items on her Instagram page, under the watchful gaze of her celebrity personal trainer Jono Castano.  Jono says Rebel works out seven days per week, and some sort of weight training isi involved every day to build up upper and lower body strength.  'Friday vibes but Rebel Wilson has been putting in the hard yards seven days per week,' Jono captioned a recent snap online.  According to Rebel's trainer Jono, the 40-year-old works out seven days per week on a rotating cycle of different activities including boxing (pictured) and weight training  2. She mixes the weight training with high intensity  High intensity exercise or HIIT has long had a reputation for being among the best ways to ditch unwanted kilos.  And Rebel's weekly workouts include stair sprints and bouts with battle ropes.  The 40-year-old takes boxing sessions at Jono's gym, as the martial art is one of the best workouts for creating lean, toned muscles.  By mixing things up, she is able to get broader benefits than focusing on a particular form of training.  Rebel has become a fan of hiking this year, sharing snaps from Barrenjoey Lighthouse in Sydney's Palm Beach after doing the Lighthouse Walk (pictured on the hike)  3.

The lighthouse walk is only 2.2km but takes around 90 minutes to complete due to its steep sections.  Her photos show the actress favours workout gear by the UK brand Gymshark.  Speaking to Yahoo Lifestyle, Rebel's trainer Jono said the best things to do if you want to transform your body is 'focus on your nutrition, train around five days a week, ensure you're recovering well by stretching and sleeping, and make sure you're taking enough supplementation and multivitamins'.  'Treat your body like a temple!' Jono said.  When it comes to diet, Rebel (pictured) has said she is a devout follower of something called the 'Mayr method', which she found out about after a trip to Austria  The 'Mayr method' is an approach that eliminates food intolerances, reduces sugar, encourages eating whole foods slowly, boosts the immune system and reduces inflammation (Rebel pictured this year)  4. She follows the 'Mayr method'  What are the main elements of the 'Mayr method'? * Stop snacking throughout the day. * Make breakfast part of the schedule, potentially dropping dinner. * Reduce dairy and gluten intake overall. * Refrain from eating raw foods after 4pm. * Refrain from doing anything else while you're eating. * Chew your foods 40 times. Advertisement  When it comes to diet, Rebel is a devout follower of the 'Mayr method'.  Rebel apparently started using the approach when she visited the luxury medical detox and wellness centre, VivaMayr in Austria.  The 'Mayr method' is an approach that eliminates food intolerances, reduces sugar, encourages eating whole foods slowly, boosts the immune system and reduces inflammation.  The method eliminates snacking, reduces gluten and dairy intake, and encourages followers to follow mindful eating techniques like chewing food slowly and eating without distractions.  The program recommends chewing each bite up to 40 times.  Rebel's new diet includes plenty of lean protein and green, leafy vegetables.  5. She is taking her time  While Rebel's weight loss has become apparent with each uploaded photo set, her trainer has said the fitness kick is only worthwhile if maintained for the long term.  Jono said that a year is a good length of time for committing to an initial fitness regime.  'Don't forget, two months, you're putting a lot of stress on yourself,' he told Yahoo.  'So, my advice is keep your goals realistic, short and then achieve them and progress from there.'  While Rebel (pictured) is working out and eating well every single day, she knows that getting fit and losing weight is not a quick fix - she is calling this year her 'year of health'  Jono (pictured) previously told FEMAIL that people should be working out for at least 45 minutes each day in order to shed the kilos  In March, Jono told Daily Mail Australia his top tips to help people lose weight.  The Sydney gym buff said that people should be working out for at least 45 minutes a day to shed the kilos.  While calorie intake is important, dieters don't have to sacrifice cheat days.  What is a typical week of workouts for Rebel Wilson? DAY ONE: HIIT and mobility DAY TWO: Weights and resistance DAY THREE: HIIT DAY FOUR: HIIT DAY FIVE: HIIT and weights DAY SIX: Recovery DAY SEVEN: HIIT Advertisement  'At a minimum, I preach to always get in 45 minutes daily. Whether that be a workout, a walk or something else that's physical that you enjoy doing,' Jono told FEMAIL.  Jono, 28, believes that high-intensity interval training (HIIT) is the best form of exercise for weight loss.  'What I do for most of my clients looking to shed some pounds is incorporating a mix of different exercises into their session. Short bursts of intense cardio combined with resistance training and weights is my special formula,' he said.  'It fires up the heart rate and calorie burn as well as builds lean muscle so your body continues to burn calories at a high rate throughout the day.'  Diet is just as important as exercise, and Jono recommends eating at a 'calorie deficit' if you want to lose weight.  'Think about it, if you train one hour a day, it's very important what you do in the other 23 hours,' he said.  'If you're looking to shed some pounds, it's important to eat at a calorie deficit meaning your total daily calorie expenditure needs to be higher than your calorie intake through what you eat.'

Extra police officers have been sent out to patrol streets in the city to ensure residents comply with the reintroduced rules. Police Scotland said it would 'continue to engage, educate and encourage people' to follow the restrictions.

It comes after the company has reportedly set its sights on opening a London HQ in a move approved by ministers.  The move highlights Chinese-owned TikTok's efforts to remain active outside of the U.S. amid threats of a ban on the app by President Donald Trump. Trump has threatened to ban the app in the U.S. on national security grounds.  TikTok is planning to build its first European data centre in Ireland as part of a Â£375 million investment  TIkTok's parent company ByteDance, which is headquartered in Beijing, announced that it has singled out Ireland as the location for its third data centre, meaning information on British and European users would be hosted on Irish servers.  'This is an important symbol of our commitment to the long term in Europe and it shows the importance of Ireland for us,' said Theo Bertram, TikTok's director of public policy in Europe.  'You can look in Europe and see that there are concerns about data transfer [to the US], I think one could perceive a gradual movement towards how that might shake out over time and this will give our users more confidence in Europe to know its on European servers,' Mr Bertram told The Times newspaper.  TikTok is the first Chinese app to have become an international hit and has 100 million users in the U.S. alone.

Anne Longfield said she 'would not rule out' pupils wearing face masks in the future if it gives people confidence.  Harry Styles's old school has become the first in the country to depart from government guidance and make face masks mandatory when classes resume.  Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School in Cheshire unilaterally decided that 'on the balance of probability' students and staff would be safer wearing coverings.  Navy blue reusable coverings costing three pounds will be viewed as 'part of the uniform' and be embroidered with the school's initials, which were once displayed by the One Direction singer who grew up in the leafy town.  Anne Longfield said she 'would not rule out' pupils wearing face masks in the future if it gives people confidence  The mandatory use of masks goes beyond the government's coronavirus guidance, which does not compel them to be worn in schools.  Downing Street today refused to give ground to intense pressure from Labour and union bosses who called for enforced coverings when children go back to lessons next month.  Schools minister Nick Gibb said that in education settings children and staff are mixing with the same people every day, unlike in shops.  But Ms Longfield, who does not have the power to mandate the wearing of masks, told BBC Breakfast: 'Certainly we know the risk both of children catching the infection and of course transmission for younger children, primary and nursery, is very, very low.  'It's still low for secondary school aged children, but there may be some children who may feel more comfortable with a mask on. So I don't rule it out.  'I don't think it's something that should be a blanket introduction as yet, unless the scientific advice is to do so, but if it means schools stay open and people have confidence I wouldn't want to rule it out either.'  Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School in Cheshire unilaterally decided that 'on the balance of probability' students and staff would be safer wearing coverings which will be embroidered with the school badge, which was once displayed by Harry Styles  Headmaster Nigel Bielby has defended his decision to run 'contrary' with official guidelines and compel his school (pictured) to wear masks  Holmes Chapel headmaster Nigel Bielby has defended his decision to run 'contrary' with official guidelines and compel his school to wear masks.  He told the BBC: 'I think we're going contrary to the guidelines because we want to keep a community that's safe and protect those vulnerable members of our community as far as we possibly can.  'We felt it was an important step that, on the balance of probability, we were more likely to feel our children and our community was safer using a face covering as opposed to not using a face covering â and of course when the children are not in those lessons and they're outside they can take that face covering off, so the misunderstanding that the children are in a face covering for six hours a day is incorrect.'  A letter sent to parents said the masks would be manufactured by Sam Dale and Son and cost three pounds.  Schools have been making themselves Covid-secure ahead of the much vaunted reopening after the summer, but the wearing of masks has not been recommended by government.  Mr Gibb said: 'Within a school, of course, you're not with people that you don't meet normally, you see these same children every day, so there are different circumstances - when you're on public transport for example, when you're encountering people you've not come across or met before.'  Yet the decision has come under attack from both Labour and unions which yesterday ramped up pressure on ministers.  Retailers Sam Dale & Son posted a picture of the Â£3 masks, and said they will be stitched with the schools initials in yellow  Schools minister Nick Gibb (pictured today) said the guidance stands, insisting that the situation is very different than in shops - where anyone aged 11 or over must wear a mask  The NASUWT union has called on the Department for Education (DfE) to revise its guidance on face coverings 'as a matter of urgency' to help staff return to school in the autumn with 'confidence'.  It said the Government should encourage school and college staff to wear clear facial visors if there are concerns that teaching and learning may be impeded by the use of face masks.  Patrick Roach, general-secretary of NASUWT, said the position in schools is 'out of step' with public health guidance that suggests face masks should be worn when physical distancing cannot be assured.  In a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, Mr Roach said: 'Strategies for minimising contact between pupils and staff (i.e. 'bubbles') are unlikely to be effective given constraints of building design, limitations of space within schools, and the inability of schools to control for wider social interactions involving children and adults within and outside their perimeters.  'We strongly suggest that your guidance for schools should now be brought into line with changes to the Government's guidance for other sectors, public transport, shops and supermarkets.'  The GMB union has also called on ministers to allow school staff to wear face masks if they want to when they return in September.  Rehana Azam, GMB national secretary, said: 'Our members tell us they are scared of what's to come in September and they feel it's strange the Government tells them to wear masks on the way to work, and if they go to get lunch, but not when they are in school.'  The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) is calling for greater clarity on whether schools can permit face masks if pupils or staff want them.  Its general-secretary Geoff Barton said the guidance leaves key questions unanswered.  'One, how should schools respond if pupils and staff want to wear face coverings?' he said.  'Two, do they have the flexibility to introduce the use of face coverings in constricted spaces where there is more mixing, for example in narrow corridors? We are seeking answers from the Government to these questions.'  Government guidance warns the misuse of face coverings may 'inadvertently increase the risk of transmission' in schools and there could be 'negative effects' on communication and education.  But Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School in Cheshire has made face masks compulsory for staff and students inside school buildings from September.  In a newsletter to parents explaining the decision to introduce face masks as part of the uniform, the school said it was a 'precautionary additional measure' to make the school safer.  Dr Sarah Lewis, senior lecturer in genetic epidemiology at the University of Bristol, warned any benefits in terms of transmission of the virus 'could be offset by anxiety caused by having to wear the masks'.  She said: 'Some children will not return to school if they are compulsory, as their parents will not send them, and this will impact on their education.  'Children are unlikely to wear them all day because they will become wet and uncomfortable and the discarded masks may be more of a risk for virus transmission.'  The government has pledged that schools will reopen fully in England from September  Gavin Williamson promises to get ALL pupils back in the classroom next term - as poll shows most parents say their children will be safe  By Daniel Martin and Josh White for the Daily Mail  Gavin Williamson vowed to get schools fully open in September yesterday after a poll found most mothers are confident their children will be safe.  The Education Secretary insisted the Government will 'succeed' in its pledge to return all pupils to classes thanks to the determination of parents.  He said the return was 'our national priority' and warned that not doing so would 'fail our children'.  Gavin Williamson vowed to get schools fully open in September yesterday after a poll found most mothers are confident their children will be safe (Stock image)  Just 3 per cent of mothers are worried that classrooms will be risky, while only 7 per cent are concerned that coronavirus measures will be upsetting for children, a survey for Mumsnet found.  There were also concerns about the impact of the closure of schools between March and July.  More than four in five mothers whose children will sit GCSEs or A-Levels next summer were worried the shutdown may have harmed their results.  It came a week after a survey by the Office for National Statistics found that 88 per cent of parents with school-age children said it was very or fairly likely that they would return in September.  Last night Mr Williamson said: 'Before the summer holidays over 1.6million pupils were back in our schools, and it is our national priority to get all children back in the classroom in September.  Education Secretary Gavin Williamson (pictured) insisted the Government will 'succeed' in its pledge to return all pupils to classes thanks to the determination of parents.  'Schools are where our children belong â not just for their education, but also for their wellbeing and to be with their fellow pupils and teachers.  'That is why we are helping schools to prepare for all children to return in a few weeks' time. Surveys show parents are increasingly confident that is the right thing to do.  'We will succeed thanks to that same determination to get many pupils back during the last few months and thousands of heads, teachers and school staff across the country are making preparations to welcome the return of all pupils. Because to do any less would be to fail our children.'  The poll showing mothers are confident about the reopening of schools will be a boost for Boris Johnson's pledge to get every child back for the autumn.  The enthusiasm for lessons to resume was replicated in the findings of a second survey, which found 90 per cent back a full re-opening next month.  Parentkind's poll for the Sun was striking in that its results in May showed just 10 per cent of parents wanted to send their child back to class.  But Mr Williamson's vision for all students to be back in lessons next month could be thwarted by union bosses who have warned ministers' guidance cannot be 'trusted'.  I have no fears for my two. They need this, says happy mother By Kumail Jaffer The science shows it's safe for her children to return to school next month, insists mother-of-two Amanda Hall. She said Frankie, 12, and nine-year-old Alfie desperately need to go back for their social development and mental health. Being off since lockdown has meant they have gone from exercising most days and seeing hundreds of other pupils to interacting with just a handful of friends. The Hall family from 11 Thor Close, Norwich. Mother-of-two Amanda Hall, 36, and her husband James, 38, say they struggle with the cost of childcare as their combined income puts them just over the threshold for free childcare Mrs Hall, from Norfolk, said: 'I am really happy for them to be going back â they have had so much time off and it has often been difficult to occupy them every single day. 'They need this. They have missed out on seeing their friends, exercise and following a normal routine. 'Having a prolonged amount of time like this is exhausting. The children will really be looking forward to returning. Going back is so important for their character and development.' The Hall children do not mix with any vulnerable members of their family, Mrs Hall said, meaning she is not too worried about them spreading the virus. She added: 'I am not bothered about the risk of the virus with them. The science shows that children are going to be absolutely fine if they get it.' However, she says other parents are well within their rights to be unhappy with their children starting school again if they feel uneasy about spreading the virus. Advertisement  Dr Mary Bousted, head of the National Education Union, said many schools would struggle to welcome back all their pupils and urged local authorities to step in.  She said the Government would be powerless to overrule councils in the event they took an opposing view.  'Local authorities and schools should take the confidence to do what they can do and that will mean for many schools that they cannot have all children fully back in September,' she told a Zoom meeting seen by the Daily Telegraph.  'Now, the Government's making threatening noises about that. But in the end, they won't be able to carry out their threats.'  Ministers are also facing pressure to allow face coverings to be worn in schools by some students.  Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has said masks for older pupils 'should be considered'.  Government guidance says face coverings are not required as pupils and staff are mixing in consistent groups.  They also point out that masks are likely to have a huge impact on communication and learning.  Children with hearing problems would find lip-reading impossible.  But the NASUWT teachers' union wants the Department for Education to revise its guidance 'as a matter of urgency' to help staff return with 'confidence'.  Meanwhile, Business Secretary Alok Sharma admitted ministers were looking at local lockdowns, which could mean schools closing on a 'case-by-case basis'.  But MPs warned Britain faces 'economic armageddon' unless children go back to class.  Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said: 'The Government has got to recognise that there is not only one risk in the world called Covid: Economic armageddon is coming down the track.  'It will result in far more people dying than ever would from Covid and will see the economy going completely flat.  'Schools are vital to getting the economy going because unless they open, parents can't get back to work.  'There'll be a tsunami of unemployment if we are not careful.  'Ministers have got to be much clearer: Schools have got to reopen â there must be no backsliding on this.'  The poll of over 1,000 Mumsnet users also found that children who were able to return to school for a period before the summer break found it beneficial.  Some 77 per cent said their child was happy to be back, including 94 per cent of parents of children in reception.  Among parents whose children have not yet returned to school at all, 75 per cent say that supporting home learning has been stressful.  Mumsnet founder and chief executive Justine Roberts said: 'The final third of this academic year has been astonishingly stressful for students, teachers and parents alike.  'It's great to see that parents are largely confident in schools' plans for coping with these strange new circumstances, and that most children who had some sort of a return to school were happy to go back.  'It's clear, though, that parents of pupils who face public exams next summer are wary and anxious about what will happen, given that so much teaching time has been irrevocably lost.'  The survey came after the Children's Commissioner for England argued schools should be kept open ahead of pubs or shops.  Anne Longfield said children were 'an afterthought' during the first lockdown and young people must be 'at the heart' of tackling a resurgence of the virus.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8597777/Harry-Styless-old-school-UKs-uniform-issue-facemask.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,e0d2dcb92a640082d066cbf6b87ed59150d2584854501833d4bf328268dc34bc,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Italian billionaire Pier Luigi Laro Piana commissioned Peters and May to transport his three-year-old yacht, My Song, between Antigua and Genoa.  However, in May 2019, the yacht, which was being carried by the freighter Brattingsborg, was lost overboard in a storm around 40 miles from Menorca and sank.  Pier Luigi Loro Piana attends a film premiere alongside Shron Stone in New York in 2019  The huge yacht was was spotted half submerged and drifting 40 miles from Menorca  'My Song's' multi-millionaire owner Pier Luigi is an heir to the high end clothing company Loro Piana  Mr Piana has seen the case transferred from Italy to the Royal Courts of Justice in London.  According to The Times, Mr Piana is suing the the firm for the replacement value of yacht.  However, the Southampton-based Peters and May deny responsibility.  According to court papers: 'The primary assessment is that the yacht's cradle - owned and provided by the yacht, warranted by the yacht for sea transport and assembled by the yacht's crew - collapsed during the voyage.'  Mr Piana's lawyers are seeking to have the case returned to an Italian court.  He had previously told La Repubblica: 'For anyone who loves the sea, this boat is like a second home, and it is as if my home has burnt down.  'We decided to transport it on a cargo ship to be sure it wasn't damaged because you can never be sure of the weather.'  The yacht was salvaged by a German firm but it was beyond economic repair as teh carbon fibre hull was holed in several places and the masts were broken off.  Her owner had arranged for 'My Song' to take part in the 2019 Loro Piana Superyacht Regatta, where she was a returning winner.  Pier Luigi is an heir to the high end clothing company Loro Piana, which was founded in 1924 by his grandfather Pietro.  My Song is described as 'a wolf in sheep's clothing' - she has a 56-metre-high mast and under full sail can reach more than 30 knots.  One yachting expert said: 'It is a terribly sad end for the illustrious yacht that was the belle of the ball at the 2017 World Superyacht Awards picking up the trophy for Best Sailing Yacht of its size.

The Rev Justin Welby branded Duffield, 49, as a 'brilliant constituency MP' and suggested she was simply misunderstood.  It comes after the Canterbury MP liked a Tweet that criticised CNN for sharing new American Cancer Society guidelines on August 1.  The media outlet captioned the post: 'Individuals with a cervix are now recommended to start cervical cancers screening at 25 and continue through age 65, with HPV testing every five years.'  The Archbishop of Canterbury has waded into a Twitter row to defend Labour MP Rosie Duffield after she was accused of transphobia  And Duffield's decision to like Piers Morgan's reply - 'do you mean women?' - drew criticism online.  Labour activist and Canterbury resident Sarah Cundy tweeted: 'Add to the list of reasons Rosie Duffield needs booting, she's a transphobe too.'  Ms Duffield then responded: 'I'm a 'transphobe' for knowing that only women have a cervix...?!'  She went on to tell other users: 'The implication that one cannot describe oneself as a woman without inviting a pile-on is beyond ridiculous now.  'Almost 52% of the UK population are women.'  In a bold message of solidarity, Rev Welby told his 152,000 Twitter followers on Tuesday: 'I know Rosie Duffield who is a brilliant constituency MP for Canterbury as well as brave, honest, kind and passionate for justice.  'She does not seek to demean others.  'To troll her is simply cruel and wrong.'  London Young Labour's LGBT officer Caoimhe Hale revealed that she had filed a complaint, while the Labour Campaign for Trans Rights said they were 'shocked and saddened at the inaccurate, transphobic comments.'  They are now calling on the party to 'take action.'  Social media users were quick to blast Rev Justin Welby's message.  Labour MP Rosie Duffield (pictured) was accused of transphobia on Twitter  Max fumed: 'P**s off, Justin, eh?  'She made transphobic comments, doubled down on them, and played the victim when she was called on it.  'Fictional Jesus doesn't want you to defend bigotry.'  Grace Petrie - who previously campaigned for Duffield - voiced her shame.  She said: 'This is, at best, spectacularly misguided.  'Rosie made some thoughtless transphobic comments and has refused to engage with anyone trying to point out how that negatively impacts an already marginalised community.'  Meanwhile others took the opportunity to blast the Archbishop for his support of other high-profile figures.  Kate said: 'To be fair you also support Prince Andrew, it seems that men of the church are strangers to morality and decent behaviour.'  Susan added: 'Brilliant constituency MP?  The Tweet from CNN that was criticised for using the phrase 'individuals with a cervix'  '18,000 unanswered emails and abuse of her own constituents on social media says otherwise I'm afraid.'  Rhammel O'Dwyer-Afflick added: ''She does not seek to demean others' and yet that's exactly what she went out of her way to do.'  Rebecca said: 'It's good to know your position on trans rights.  'To support Rosie universally is to support her awful views.  'We. See. You.'  There were widespread calls for Ms Duffield to resign from her post as MP.

2020-08-06 13:17:09.128785,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 08:09:32 GMT",Police advised to still automatically believe alleged abuse victims in guidelines despite warnings,"Police are still being advised to automatically believe alleged abuse victims in new guidelines despite warnings from a senior judge in his review of the 'Nick the fantasist' case.  The College of Policing guidance, which was published today, controversially tells detectives investigating claims of child abuse that 'the intention is that victims are believed'.  Sir Richard Henriques, in his review of how police handled claims of VIP sex abuse from the fantasist Carl Beech, called for the instruction to be withdrawn because suspects are innocent until proven guilty.  Beech's slurs were described as 'credible and true' by a senior officer, and went on to trash the reputations of esteemed public figures including D-Day hero Lord Bramall, former Home Secretary Leon Brittan, ex-Prime Minister Sir Edward Heath and former Tory MP Harvey Proctor.  The new guidance comes despite warnings from retired judge Sir Richard Henriques, in his review of how police handled claims of VIP sex abuse from the fantasist Carl Beech (pictured in a police interview from 2016)  Sir Richard criticised the decision to keep the guidance, telling The Times: 'They've learnt nothing at all from Nick.  'The whole basis of their explanation for believing Nick is that they were driven to believe by the protocol that was in existence.'  The guidance was produced by the College of Policing and senior officers in Operation Hydrant, which leads the investigation of historic abuse allegations.  It was today defended by Hydrant chief Simon Bailey, who insisted officers did not apply 'blind belief'.  He said that victims were constantly told by their abusers they would never be believed, and they would never come to the police if they did not feel they would be listened to.  The new guidance also urges officers not to go 'trawling' for abuse victims but to use prior investigation to approach specific groups of possible victims or witnesses.  It also advises the, when releasing information about a suspect who has died, officers must 'make it clear that there police are making no judgments about guilt'.  Wiltshire Police was criticised for holding a press conference outside the late former Prime Minister's Edward Heath's home in 2015 to announce they were investigating claims he was a paedophile, before urging other alleged victims to come forward.  The force later said that, if the politician had been alive, he would have been interviewed about seven disclosures under criminal caution.  Carl Beech - the fantasist and paedophile known by the pseudonym 'Nick' - was sentenced to eighteen years in prison in July 2019 to his false claims, including against Sir Edward.  Sir Richard criticised the decision to keep the guidance, saying: 'They've learnt nothing at all from Nick'  Sir Richard's report on Scotland Yard's investigation, Operation Midland, advised that 'the instruction to believe a victim's account should cease'.  He said people who make allegations to police should be called complainants, not victims, so not to imply guilt. The report, commissioned by the Met, was handed to senior commanders in 2016 but was finally published in full in October 2019.  It exposed the appalling failures of senior officers who believed Nick's false allegations as they mounted a bungled Â£2.5 million investigation which ruined the lives of war hero Lord Bramall, Lord Brittan and Mr Proctor.  Police decided to automatically believe claims of sexual abuse in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, when it emerged that credible rape reports had been dismissed.  But the approach led to the Met notoriously describing as 'credible and true' the false allegations made by Beech, which were also backed in Parliament by the Labour MP Tom Watson.  The 51-year-old falsely alleged that between the ages of seven and 16 he had been collected by car from his various schools in the country and driven to London, where he and other young boys were raped, burned, stabbed and tortured.  He claimed the offences were committed in the Carlton Club or in the apartment block in Pimlico called Dolphin Square. Afterwards, Nick would be returned by car to his home, where he lived alone with his mother.  He had originally made allegations to Wiltshire Police, who had interviewed him but concluded he lacked credibility.  His mother was also questioned and told them she had no knowledge of any unauthorised absence from school and had never seen any bloodstained underwear or similar sign of sexual abuse.  Yet Met officers listening to his claims were not given his earlier interviews so missed the large number of inconsistencies.  Beech's slurs were notoriously called 'credible and true' during a press conference outside New Scotland Yard  Sir Richard said they then continued investigating his claims 'in a disordered and chaotic manner and littered with mistakes'.  In his new book, From Crime To Crime, which was serialised in the Daily Mail, the former judge wrote: 'They failed to ask Nick for his computers or mobile phone.  'They ignored the fact that his medical records disclosed no injury consistent with his allegations in his personal online blog that his feet were stabbed and burned, poppies pinned to his bare chest and numerous bones broken.  'They had no regard to the inherent improbability of men of the highest standing and impeccable character having behaved in the manner alleged.'  Moving on the notorious 'credible and true' press conference, he continued: 'Instead the police made a public appeal for information, with a senior officer, Detective Superintendent Kenny McDonald, standing outside New Scotland Yard and telling a press conference that they believed Nick's allegations to be both 'credible and true'.  'The words should never have been uttered, and the officer himself later admitted they were inappropriate, saying he selected the wrong words in the heat of an interview.  'But there was no correction for many months, by which time, as we will see below, two completely bogus potential witnesses had come forward with more lies purporting to support 'Nick'.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8599005/Police-advised-automatically-believe-alleged-abuse-victims-guidelines-despite-warnings.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,1d7f20da3c6182213522ca99350fa9cf1bb542cb7ace8c1f333f7af824d3822d,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The living conditions inside the bunkers are basic, with mold and stagnant air due to the lack of ventilation.

The former model who uses the name 'KiKi' and claims she was sexually assaulted by Epstein in 2004 at the age of 19, and in February penned an open letter to Prince Andrew urging him to cooperate with the FBI's probe into the late financier.  Speaking to FEMAIL ahead of Crime + Investigation's Surviving Jeffrey Epstein, she insisted Andrew should be 'held accountable' for his friendship with the paedophile, and that it's 'ridiculous' to think being stripped of royal duties is a worthy 'punishment'.  In November last year, Andrew took early retirement from royal duties in the wake of his disastrous Newsnight interview in which he failed to express sympathy for Epstein's victims, amid allegations from Virginia Roberts Giuffre that he had sex with her when she was 17.  The Duke has strenuously denied allegations of any sexual misconduct, or witnessing any wrong doing, while claiming he would be happy to cooperate with US investigators.  A victim of Jeffery Epstein says the Duke of York , pictured last year, being stripped of royal duties is not enough following his friendship with the disgraced paedophile, because he's still living a 'privileged and wealthy life'  A former model who uses the name 'KiKi' was sexually assaulted by Epstein in 2004 at the age of 19, and in February penned an open letter to Prince Andrew. she is pictured with lawyer Lisa Bloom (left)  'He should be held accountable,' said Kiki, 'It doesn't matter who he is or what family he was born into.'  She went on to say that if the Duke is guilty of turning a blind eye to Epstein's abuse, or taking part in illegal activity, as his accuser Roberts has alleged, that the 'punishment does not fit the crime'.  'If he witnessed illegal activity, if he was complicit and complacent, or if he participated in illegal activity as Virginia Giuffre has stated multiple times, then being stripped of your royal duties, but still having the privilege of being wealthy and powerful, the punishment does not fit the crime here and it's ridiculous to think that it does.'  Earlier this year Kiki penned a powerful letter asking Prince Andrew to help the US authorities following his friendship with Epstein, for the sake of his 'daughters and their children'.  Kiki was a model in New York City whose agency had dropped her at 19 when she was assaulted by the late financier  She told of her 'anger' at the Duke for failing to respond to the plea, which was countersigned by three unnamed 'Jane Doe' victims.  'We need answers', said Kiki. 'We need to get to the bottom of it and find out who any other co-conspirator was, even someone who just looked the other way and not report it.  'All of those things are still important and people need to be held accountable. We did not receive an answer, of course and now he's refusing to co-operate at all which is not surprising to me.'  She went on to claim the Duke's apparent lack of cooperation suggests to her he's 'hiding something' and says it's a 'shame' his position in the monarchy has made it 'much more complicated' for him to assist the FBI.  Kiki claimed Epstein 'saw three to four girls a day' in New York City, and it would be difficult for the Duke to turn a blind eye to Epstein's crimes. She is pictured during a press conference in February  'He is protected by the royal family and that stature and life', said Kiki, 'It's a shame that because we're in two different countries it makes it so much more complicated for the FBI to interview him.  'It's disappointing and it's also like, what do you have to hide? It makes you really angry, because obviously he's hiding something and he can't help. You just hope any effort you can make to keep public pressure on will make a difference. '  Kiki was a model in New York City whose agency had dropped her at 19. A young woman approached Kiki at her hostessing job and told her about a client who was rich and connected.  She told that after being manipulated into agreeing to give Epstein a massage at his mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, she was sexually assaulted by the millionaire paedophile.  The Duke, pictured in 2018, has strenuously denied allegations of any sexual misconduct, or witnessing any wrong doing, while claiming he would be happy to cooperate with US investigators  'I was recruited by a woman that worked for him when I was a hostess in a restaurant in New York city, said Kiki, 'We became friends and that's when I met him and that's when he assaulted me.'  Kiki went on to claim that while the 'court of public opinion can be really harsh', his friendship with Epstein, who 'saw three to four girls a day' in New York City, means it would be difficult for the Duke to turn a blind eye to Epstein's crimes.  'I don't know him, I don't know how he's living his life, I don't know if he's still enjoying the privileges his life has offered him, he probably is.  'The court of public opinion can be really harsh and it can be guilty until proven innocent, in some cases.  'But there's so much substantiating evidence to show he was very good friends with him and in my experience, he [Epstein] saw three to four girls a day in New York, he definitely knows something and doesn't want to talk.'

And now the celebrity chef has taken to TikTok to offer advice to those hoping to pursue a career in the kitchen and, as usual, he isn't holding back.  In a series of amusing videos, the 53-year-old, who is currently staying in the Cornwall home he shares with wife Tana, 45, and his five children aged between one and 22, disparages the culinary creations of various 'influencer chefs.'  Amongst the harsh criticism includes Gordon telling one that his meatball sauce looks like 'wall paste,' while he can be seen berating another by comparing his steak to his granddad's colostomy bag.  Gordon Ramsay compares a wagyu steak dish to his 'granddad's colostomy bag' (left) and a version of Ikea's Swedish meatballs to 'wallpaper paste' (right)  In one clip, personal trainer David Templer, from Highgate, London, who describes himself as the 'shirtless chef boy,' can be seen rustling up his own version of Ikea's Swedish meatballs, while topless.  He excitedly commentates as he cooks 20 Waitrose essential beef meatballs in a pan with no seasoning, before whipping up a sauce separately, which Gordon quickly says bears a resemblance to 'wallpaper paste'.  'Chuck your meatballs in, once they've browned turned your heat right down and crack on with the sauce,' David explains.  He then adds 40g of butter to 40g of plain flour and whisks it together, causing Gordon to profane and declare it's far too much flour.  David then adds two thirds of a cup of vegetable stock and two thirds of a cup of beef stock and stirs continuously, before adding two thirds of a cup of extra thick double cream.

'Stop it, cook out the flour, you doughnut,' Gordon says, reacting to the video.'  Referring to the wannabe chef's accent and shouting style, popularised by The Body Coach, he adds: 'There's only one Joe Wicks,'  Gordon signs off by poking fun at Jamie Oliver by saying 'one Naked Chef' was enough - which refers to the late nineties cooking show that bought his fellow TV cook fame.

Smith then carries out the attack, yanking the man's head back and his friend appears to say: 'Get that 'motherf***er.'  At the same time the friend jumps out of the vehicle, grabbing his crying son and encouraging Smith to get out.  As the driver gets out and yells for witnesses to call police, the car is seen rolling away.  By the time police from the Flagler County Sheriff's Office (FCSO) responded to the intersection of Belle Terre Parkway and Royal Palm Parkway after receiving calls regarding a fight in the street, Smith was on top of the driver restricting his movement.

He claims he grabbed the driver and forced him to pull over in order to protect himself and his friends.  On the other hand, the Lyft driver told deputies that Smith suddenly attacked him while he was driving, causing him to lose control of the vehicle. He said the two exited the vehicle with the car still in drive and began to fight in the street while the driver called out for passersby to contact police.  The driver also said Smith spat on him and cops noticed spit beneath his eye.  The driver told deputies that he has a dash camera in his vehicle that records the interior as well as the road.  Deputies reviewed the footage which corroborated his story.  Police asked Smith to give his friend and son access to his home as they were visiting from Maine however he refused to give them a key and replied: 'Go f*** yourselves.'  Deputies gave the other passenger and his child a courtesy ride to a local hotel after the boy told cops: 'I just want to go to sleep.'

So perhaps it's no wonder that one woman's grotesque take on the new trend - made entirely of pasta - has been branded 'a failure of modern civilisation'.  In a video shared on TikTok, the American woman is seen covering a table with tin foil, before dolloping out pasta across it and peppering it with slices of garlic bread.  But with no plates and only a couple of large plastic serving spoons on hand, it looks like her guests will be eating with their hands.  'Y'all have heard of nacho table, I raise you pasta table,' the woman said.  Scroll down for video  Australians are horrified by an American woman's 'pasta grazing board' (pictured) which is simply piles of pasta scooped onto a tinfoil covered dining table  Grazing boards are popular Down Under but typically contain cured meats and cheese decoratively arranged on platters with colourful fruit and sweets.

Disgusted Australians said they'd 'pass' on the 'anxiety inducing' spread, with one viewer from Queensland declaring: 'It's a no from me.'  Another added: 'As an Italian, I'm going to have to pass.'  'I feel like this was something that was better as an idea,' said a third.  A fourth said the sight of the table 'gives her anxiety' because of the risk of spreading germs.

In the video, a woman is seeing covering a dining table with tinfoil (left) and scooping pasta from saucepans (right) on top  Guests sit around the tinfoil covered table, seemingly without plates  One particularly outraged man said: 'What the hell is up with this trend? We are steadily failing as civilised folk.'  Others wondered why she had bothered transferring the pasta to the tinfoil in the first place when she could have eaten it straight from the saucepan.

Alison Carey, 57, is accusing her mom, Patricia, of forcing her to perform sex acts on strangers when she was just 10-years-old.  The Sun reported that in the lawsuit filed with the New York Supreme Court, Alison alleges that as well as enduring her own abuse she also had to watch other youngsters being abused 'during middle-of-the-night satanic worship meetings that included ritual sacrifices'.  Scroll down for video  Mariah Carey's sister, Alison, is planning on suing their mother Patricia. She is pictured in 2016  The Careys (pictured) haven't talked since 1991. Alison claims she was sexually abused when she was ten while her mother conducted 'satanic worship meetings' which left her with PTSD  Mariah Carey is pictured with her mother, Patricia, during a Christmas celebration in 2010  Patricia Carey is pictured arriving at Radio City Music Hall to see daughter perform in 2019  In 2016, Alison Carey was arrested on charges of prostitution. Carey, a former drug addict, was diagnosed with HIV in the 1990s  Alison, 57, is known to have once worked as a prostitute and is HIV positive. She is believed to have lost all of her teeth and is now desperate to get money to have them fixed.  The lawsuit reveals more sordid details that Alison is said to have witnessed during the early 1970s and states how her 'mother, allowed and encouraged men to engage in sexual acts including forcible touching and sexual assault in the first degree.'  In a previous interview in 2018, she claimed that a family member used to take her to occult gatherings in the early hours of the morning where she was abused by cloaked worshippers.  'Terrible things would happen - things that a child should never see,' she said.  'I was sexually abused there. They told me that if I didn't do what they told me or if I told them what was going on they would harm Mariah.'  Alison claims the abuse went on for several years and states through the lawsuit that as a result of what she allegedly witnessed and endured she has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression which in turn put her on a downward spiral of drug abuse 'in an attempt to suppress the horrific memories'.  Alison who is seven years older than Mariah â had long been rumored to be on the brink of homelessness, broke and working as a prostitute for several years, but was clean as of 2018. She is pictured in a hospital visit after a 2014 home invasion  Patricia Carey, top, is pictured with Mariah Carey when she was a little girl  She also notes that the trauma she felt meant she had to undergo extensive professional counseling.  'Plaintiff now demands compensatory money damages for immense psychological and physical damage, mental pain and anguish and intentional infliction of severe emotion distress,' the suit states.  The pair, Alison, left, Mariah, right have reportedly not spoken to each other for nearly 20 years  In 2016, Carey was found to be working as a prostitute out of a hotel in Saugerties, Ulster County, in Upstate New York when she was caught in a sting operation by police.  According to cops Carey was advertising herself online using her multi-millionaire pop star sister's lyrics.  Carey was described by authorities as a 'transient' but had reportedly been offering her services out of the hotel for a week.  Soon after the event, Carey spoke directly to her sister in a video recorded by The Daily Mail, asking the pop star - who is worth an estimated $520million - for financial support.  As well as struggling with HIV, the recovering drug addict was also reportedly left with brain and spine injuries after a devastating home invasion attack in 2015.  In the video, she begged her sister singer, with whom she hadn't spoken with since a huge falling out in 1991: 'Mariah I love you, and I desperately need your help, please don't abandon me like this.'

Four members of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, who each lost their fathers to the virus, gave evidence to the newly-formed All Party Parliamentary Group on coronavirus.  They said they believed their loved ones would be alive if the Government had provided better medical advice, including via the helpline, locked down the country earlier, shut borders and quarantined travellers sooner.  In moving testimony, the group revealed they have written to the Prime Minister three times but had so far been refused a meeting with Boris Johnson. They accused the Government of ignoring their plight.  They are demanding an urgent independent judge-led public inquiry to prevent more unnecessary deaths in the event of a second wave of coronavirus.  Four members of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, who each lost their fathers to the virus, gave evidence to the newly-formed All Party Parliamentary Group on coronavirus (pictured: Layla Moran hosts the inaugural meeting of an All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus, July 8)  Jo Goodman, founder of the bereaved families group, whose father, Stuart, 72, contracted the virus the week before lockdown and died on April 2, said many of their 1,450-strong members believed their loved ones struggled to get through to 111, or were told not to go to hospital despite being 'in the worst condition of their lives'.  'There is a huge amount of people in our group where the 111 service was telling people to stay at home despite symptoms which were extremely severe,' she said.  'People were passing away with no medical intervention other than paracetamol and bedrest.'  Miss Goodman said families had complained that the 111 lines were constantly busy, call handlers had failed to take medical history into account and symptoms were mis-read or communicated incorrectly, especially where patients did not have English as their first language.

He said black and ethnic minority members of the bereaved families group had told him call handlers had made judgments on irrelevant questions, such as whether their loved one's lips had turned blue.  'With a black person, you cannot tell if their lips are blue,' he said.  The cross-party parliamentary group also heard from members of the so-called 'Long Covid' support group, who revealed that as many as 15,000 people who contracted the virus continue to suffer chronic symptoms, including blindness and incontinence, or have been left wheelchair bound months later.

Last year, there were zero murders, only one robbery and less than 2,300 total reported crimes.  The video has been ridiculed on social media, with some comparing it to Hot Fuzz.  One person wrote: 'I'm literally going to die from second hand embarrassment. Somebody call the police.'  Another said: 'Does this reflect day to day policing in Guernsey? I think not.

The international community has rallied to send aid to the country already on the brink of economic ruin - but citizens are fearful Lebanon will never recover.

The economic cost of the damage is thought to be around $5billion, added to the more-pressing human cost includes 300,000 people left homeless along with hospitals struggling to cope.  The Red Cross was coordinating with the Health Ministry to set up morgues as hospitals were overwhelmed and running out of beds and equipment to tend to the injured.

Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed those responsible will 'pay the price' as he declared a two-week state of emergency to deal with the crisis, urging all world leaders and 'friends of Lebanon' to donate aid to the country, adding: 'We are witnessing a real catastrophe.'  Lebanon's cabinet subsequently voted to place all officials responsible for port security for the last six years under house arrest, though customers officers pointed the finger of blame back the other way - saying authorities were repeatedly warned about the danger but failed to act.

Britain's aid package will also include expert assistance and the potential for a Royal Navy survey ship to help assess the damage caused to the port. Mr Raab said the Lebanese prime minister told him there would be a 'full, thorough and rigorous investigation to get to the truth â I think the people of the Lebanon deserve no less â and that there will be full accountability'. The Government has said all embassy staff based in Beirut are accounted for, but some have suffered 'non-life-threatening injuries'. Mr Raab said the details of Britons caught up in the Beirut blast were still being established. 'We are not sure on the precise figures in relation to UK nationals there, we will obviously want to bottom out that in the days ahead,' the Foreign Secretary said. 'Obviously we have a consular team there which are monitoring that very carefully.'

France says it is sending two planes with dozens of emergency workers, a mobile medical unit and 15 tons of aid. French President Emmanuel Macron's office says the aid should allow for the treatment of some 500 victims.  French peacekeepers stationed in Lebanon, a former French protectorate, have been helping since the explosions, Macron's office said.  Jordan says a military field hospital including all necessary personnel will be dispatched, according to the Royal Court. Egypt has opened a field hospital in Beirut to receive the wounded.

Denmark says it is ready to provide humanitarian assistance to Lebanon, and Greece says it is ready to help Lebanese authorities 'with all means at its disposal.'  Russia's emergency officials say the country will send five planeloads of aid to Beirut after an explosion in the Lebanese capital's port killed at least 100 people and injured thousands on Tuesday.  Germany says it is ready to send a team of 47 search-and-rescue experts to Beirut after the enormous explosion in the city's port on Tuesday killed at least 100 people and injured thousands.  Germany also says its embassy was damaged in the blast but diplomats have reactivated an old building and are able to work.  Meanwhile President Donald Trump last night offered US aid to Lebanon, before calling the explosion a 'terrible attack' and claiming that his generals had said it appeared to have been caused by a 'bomb of some kind', without offering evidence.  Robert Baer, a former CIA operative who operated for years in the Middle East, stuck a more nuanced tone -saying the explosion appears to have been an accident, but he is not convinced that ammonium nitrate was the sole cause.  He pointed to videos of what appeared to be fireworks going off amid a pall of white smoke, right before the main blast which sent a column of reddish-brown smoke high into the sky.  Baer told CNN that those 'fireworks' were likely munitions that had been stored as part of a weapons cache that included military-grade propellant.  'It was clearly a military explosive,' he said. 'It was not fertilizer like ammonium nitrate. I'm quite sure of that.'  But he added that it would likely take years to learn the truth of what caused the blast, if it was ever revealed, because 'no one is going to want to admit they kept military explosives at the port'.  Lebanon is effectively run by Hezbollah, an Iranian paramilitary group with a history of secrecy.  The U.S. embassy in Beirut warned residents in the city about reports of toxic gases released by the blast, urging people to stay indoors and wear masks if available.  Thousands of people have also been left homeless by the blast, which threatened a mass exodus from the Mediterranean country that was already suffering with coronavirus, poor governance, and an economic crisis.  'We've had some dark days in Lebanon over the years but this is something else,' said Rami Rifai, a 38-year-old engineer, speaking to AFP from a hospital where his two daughters were receiving treatment after sustaining cuts despite being half a kilometre from the seat of the blast.  'We already had the economic crisis, a government of thieves and coronavirus. I didn't think it could get worse but now I don't know if this country can get up again. Everyone is going to try to leave. I will try to leave,' he said, his voice choked by tears.  Firefighters had already been on the scene dealing with an initial blaze when the explosion took place. One security source told Reuters that the initial fire was caused during welding work on a hole in a warehouse wall.  Sources said the blaze started at warehouse 9 of the port and spread to warehouse 12, where the ammonium nitrate was stored.  One Israeli bomb expert suggested fireworks could have been stored in one of the warehouses close to the ammonium nitrate.  Explosives certification expert Boaz Hayoun said: 'Before the big explosion ... in the center of the fire, you can see sparks, you can hear sounds like popcorn and you can hear whistles. This is very specific behavior of fireworks.'  A drone captures the devastation wrought by the explosion, including a watery crater (bottom left) where the warehouse containing the explosive chemicals previously stood  An aerial image of port before the explosion took place, showing the now-destroyed grain silo at the centre of the image with the warehouse containing the explosives to the left of it - which is now completely gone  An aerial view shows the massive damage at Beirut port's grain silos and the area around it  Beirut's governor estimated that damage from the blast would cost Lebanon up to $5billion, as it destroyed the port through which many of its valuable imports passed (pictured, the remains of the port and a grain silo that was destroyed)  A survivor of the Beirut blast is pulled from rubble of a building that was ripped apart by a shockwave that reverberated around the city, tearing it apart  Soldiers use pickaxes to dig through the rubble of buildings in Beirut in a desperate search for survivors on Wednesday  Lebanese soldiers patrol the streets of Beirut on Wednesday to keep the peace after a blast tore the city apart  A woman is evacuated from the partially destroyed Beirut neighbourhood of Mar Mikhael in the aftermath of a massive explosion in the Lebanese capital  A shockwave caused by the blast left barely a building in the city untouched, with damage reported up to 15 miles away  Survivors of the blast walk the streets of the city, looking for victims amid the ruins of their old neighbourhoods  Wounded people are treated at a hospital following the explosion, which has left hundreds of casualties in Beirut last night  Men gather in a street close to the destroyed port as they sift through the ruins of Beirut to salvage what they can  A destroyed facade of a building is seen following the blast on Tuesday.

Charbel Haj, who works at the harbour, said the explosion started as small explosions like firecrackers before he was suddenly thrown off his feet by the huge blast.  The explosion damaged the Roum Hospital, which put out a call for people to bring it spare generators to keep its electricity going as it evacuated patients because of heavy damage.  Ammonium nitrate - the terrorist's bomb ingredient Ammonium nitrate - identified as the cause of the deadly explosion in Beirut - is an odourless crystalline substance used as a fertilizer that has been behind many industrial explosions and terrorist attacks over the decades. Two tonnes of it was used to create the bomb in the 1995 Oklahoma City attack that destroyed a federal building, leaving 168 people dead, and it has been widely used by the Taliban in improvised devices. Experts say a fire in Beirut started after a spark from a welder likely ignited the highly reactive chemical, causing a blast the equivalent to three million kilotons of TNT, killing at least 100 people and leaving thousands more injured. There were 2,750 tonnes of the hazardous chemical held in the warehouse at the time of the explosion - which measured as the equivalent of a 3.5 earthquake. Death and injury from the explosion would have come in a number of phases, according to Dr David Caldicott from the Australian National University. 'Primary injuries are blast-related, as a consequence of the overpressure wave interacting with the hollow space in victims; lung injuries are often survived, but subsequently fatal, and bowel injuries are common. 'Secondary injuries are caused by flying debris; effectively environmental shrapnel. 'Tertiary injuries are as a consequence of being thrown by the blast, and quaternary injuries by other features such as inhalation.' When combined with fuel oils, ammonium nitrate creates a potent explosive widely used in the construction industry, but also by insurgent groups to create bombs. As well as the Oklahoma City bomb in the US, it has been used in a number of IRA attacks on the UK. These include the Bishopsgate attack in April 1993 that left 40 injured and a 40ft wide crater, and a 3,300lb bomb in Manchester in June 1996 that left 2000 injured but no deaths due to a phone warning an hour before the blast. In agriculture, ammonium nitrate fertiliser is applied in granule form and quickly dissolves under moisture, allowing nitrogen to be released into the soil. However, under normal storage conditions and without very high heat, it is difficult to ignite ammonium nitrate, Jimmie Oxley, a chemistry professor at the University of Rhode Island, said. 'If you look at the video (of the Beirut explosion), you saw the black smoke, you saw the red smoke - that was an incomplete reaction,' she said. 'I am assuming that there was a small explosion that instigated the reaction of the ammonium nitrate - whether that small explosion was an accident or something on purpose I haven't heard yet.' That's because ammonium nitrate is an oxidiser - it intensifies combustion and allows other substances to ignite more readily, but is not itself very combustible. For these reasons, there are generally very strict rules about where it can be stored: for example, it must be kept away from fuels and sources of heat. In fact, many countries in the European Union require that calcium carbonate to be added to ammonium nitrate to create calcium ammonium nitrate, which is safer. In the United States, regulations were tightened significantly after the Oklahoma City attack, with inspections required if more than 2,000lbs of it are stored in one place. Advertisement  Outside the St George University Hospital in Beirut's Achrafieh neighbuorhood, people with various injuries arrived in ambulances, in cars and on foot.  The explosion had caused major damage inside the building and knocked out the electricity at the hospital. Dozens of injured were being treated on the spot on the street outside, on stretchers and wheelchairs.  Lebanon's Red Cross said it had been drowning in calls from injured people, many who are still trapped in their homes.  Miles from the scene of the blast, balconies were knocked down, ceiling collapsed and windows were shattered.  Beirut's main airport, six miles away from the port, was reportedly damaged by the explosion, with pictures showing sections of collapsed ceiling.  Beirut's governor told journalists he does not know the cause of the explosion and said he had never seen such destruction, comparing the sobering scenes to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Local Fady Roumieh was stood in the car park to shopping centre ABC Mall Achrafieh, around 2km east of the blast, when the explosion occurred.  He said: 'It was like a nuclear bomb. The damage is so widespread and severe all over the city.  'Some buildings as far as 2km are partially collapsed. It's like a war zone. The damage is extreme. Not one glass window intact.'  A soldier at the port, where relatives of the missing scrambled for news of their loved ones, said: 'It's a catastrophe inside. There are corpses on the ground. Ambulances are still lifting the dead.'  A woman in her twenties stood screaming at security forces, asking about the fate of her brother, a port employee.  'His name is Jad, his eyes are green,' she pleaded, to no avail as officers refused her entry.  'It was like an atomic bomb,' said Makrouhie Yerganian, a retired schoolteacher in her mid-70s who has lived near the port for decades.  'I've experienced everything, but nothing like this before,' even during the country's 1975-1990 civil war, she said.  'All the buildings around here have collapsed.'  One witness said: 'I saw a fireball and smoke billowing over Beirut. People were screaming and running, bleeding.  'Balconies were blown off buildings. Glass in high-rise buildings shattered and fell to the street.'  Rami Rifai, a 38-year-old engineer,from a hospital where his two daughters were receiving treatment after sustaining cuts despite being half a kilometre from the seat of the blast said: 'We've had some dark days in Lebanon over the years but this is something else.  'We already had the economic crisis, a government of thieves and coronavirus. I didn't think it could get worse but now I don't know if this country can get up again. Everyone is going to try to leave. I will try to leave,' he said, his voice choked by tears.  One resident of Mar Mikhail, one of the most affected neighbourhoods, said she saw bodies strewn in the middle of the street, apparently thrown off balconies and rooftops by the blast.  For a long time after the blast, ambulance sirens sounded across the city and helicopters hovered above.  Residents said glass was broken in houses from Raouche, on the Mediterranean city's western tip, to Rabieh 10 km (6 miles) east).  And in Cyprus, a Mediterranean island lying 110 miles (180 km) northwest of Beirut, residents reported hearing two large bangs in quick succession.  One resident of the capital Nicosia said his house shook, rattling shutters.  'We do not have information about what has happened precisely, what has caused this, whether its accidental or manmade act,' he said.  Condolences poured in from across the world with Gulf nations, the United States and even Lebanon's arch foe Israel offering to send aid. France also promised to send assistance.  The blast revived memories of a 1975-90 civil war and its aftermath, when Lebanese endured heavy shelling, car bombings and Israeli air raids. Some residents thought an earthquake had struck.  'The blast blew me off metres away. I was in a daze and was all covered in blood. It brought back the vision of another explosion I witnessed against the U.S. embassy in 1983,' said Huda Baroudi, a Beirut designer.  DOZENS MISSING AS LEBANESE LAUNCH DESPERATE SEARCH FOR LOVED ONES Dozens of people have been reported missing following a cataclysmic explosion in Beirut as Lebanese people issued desperate appeals for information about their loved ones. An Instagram page called 'locate victims Beirut' sprung up in the wake of the tragedy, featuring images of those whose fates were unknown - including dock workers and firemen who rushed to the initial blaze before the larger blast. People also flocked to emergency rooms where some of the 4,000 injured in the blast had been taken, desperately hoping for news. Marwan Chamaouni (left) and Leila Nasser Fawaz (right) were among those reported as missing by Lebanese media following the explosion in Beirut which killed at least 100 people A firefighter named Ralph Mallahi (left and right) was also listed among the missing online, with relatives saying he was sent to the site of the initial fire before the main explosion and has not been seen since At least 100 people have been confirmed dead in the explosion though that total is expected to keep rising. The intensity of the blast threw victims into the sea and rescue teams were still trying to recover bodies. Many of those killed were port and custom employees and people working in the area or driving through during rush hour. The Red Cross was coordinating with the Health Ministry to set up morgues because hospitals were overwhelmed, Search and rescue teams were also coming through the rubble of nearby neighbourhoods in the hopes of finding survivors, with at least one person pulled from a destroyed apartment building. The port district was left a tangled wreck, disabling the nation's main route for imports needed to feed a nation of more than 6 million people. Lebanon has already been struggling to house and feed hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria. Hassan Zaiter, 32, a manager at the heavily damaged Le Gray Hotel in downtown Beirut, said: 'This explosion seals the collapse of Lebanon.' Appeals were also issued online for Ali Abbas Ismael (left) and Marwan Chamouni (right), who could not be found after the explosion Advertisement  Footage shows a thick column of smoke rising from the port before an explosion sends a fireball into the sky  A general view of the harbor area with smoke billowing from an area of a large explosion, with damage and debris after a large explosion rocked the harbor area of Beirut  The scene of the explosion that devastated the capital of Beirut last night.

Late last year investigators revealed what was effectively a state-sponsored pyramid scheme being run by the central bank, which was borrowing from commercial banks at above-market interest rates to pay back its debts and maintain the Lebanese pound's fixed exchange rate with the US dollar. In January mass protests against the corruption allegations and a faltering economy led to the fall of Prime Minister Saad Hariri's government. His predecessor , Independent Hassan Diab, cut the country's budget by $700million and put in place a financial rescue plan a month later. But Lebanon's problems have persisted after the Covid-19 pandemic forced global border closures, and protests have returned after the Lebanese pound fell in value, despite a lockdown being imposed in March. Many businesses have been forced to close, but as prices continue to rise with a devalued currency some are struggling to buy basic necessities, and the prime minister warned that Lebanon was at risk of a 'major food crisis'. Analysts suggest the crisis has been prolonged because of political sectarianism, with the president, prime minister and speaker split between the three largest cultural groups; Christians; Shia Muslim; and Sunni Muslims. Parliament is also drawn down the middle between Christian and Muslim members. With the country's governance in need of unity between the competing groups, external powers have been able to interfere in the country. Iran, for instance, backs the militant Hezbollah Shia movement Advertisement  UN chief Antonio Guterres expressed his 'deepest condolences ... following the horrific explosions in Beirut' which he said had also injured some United Nations personnel.  Boris Johnson offered to help the crisis-hit country, tweeting: 'The pictures and videos from Beirut tonight are shocking.  'All of my thoughts and prayers are with those caught up in this terrible incident. The UK is ready to provide support in any way we can, including to those British nationals affected.'  The UK Foreign Office has said a few of its embassy staff sustained non-life threatening injuries in the blast.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said in a tweet: 'The images of explosions in Beirut are deeply worrying. Our thoughts are with those affected, the emergency services and the people of Lebanon.'  Offers of aid also came from bitter rivals Israel, with which it is still technically at war.  Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, on behalf of the State of Israel, have offered the Lebanese government - via international intermediaries - medical and humanitarian aid, as well as immediate emergency assistance,' said a joint statement from the two ministries.  Last week, Israel accused the Lebanese group Hezbollah of trying to send gunmen across the UN-demarcated Blue Line and said it held the Lebanese government responsible for what it termed an attempted 'terrorist' attack.  Hezbollah said all of the country's political powers must unite to overcome the 'painful catastrophe'.  French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said that France stood 'alongside Lebanon' and was ready to help, tweeting: 'France stands and will always stand by the side of Lebanon and the Lebanese. It is ready to provide assistance according to the needs expressed by the Lebanese authorities.  US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted: 'We are monitoring and stand ready to assist the people of Lebanon as they recover from this horrible tragedy.'  Iran's foreign minister has said it is standing by to help Lebanon recover from the fallout of the explosion.  Countries in the Gulf paid tribute to victims of the explosion as Qatar said it would send field hospitals to support Lebanon's medical response.  Qatar's ruler Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani called President Michel Aoun to offer condolences, according to the state-run Qatar News Agency.  Sheikh Tamim wished 'a speedy recovery for the injured,' adding that he 'expressed Qatar's solidarity with brotherly Lebanon and its willingness to provide all kinds of assistance'.

Among those to answer the call were Iran, Britain and France. Israel, whom Lebanon is still technically at war with, also offered their support. 'Following the explosion in Beirut, Defense Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, on behalf of the State of Israel, have offered the Lebanese government - via international intermediaries - medical and humanitarian aid, as well as immediate emergency assistance,' said a joint statement from the two ministries. The offer comes after two weeks of heightened tensions between the rival neighbours, with a series of border clashes between the Israeli Defence Forces and Hezbollah on Israel's northern frontier. Israel accused the Lebanese group Hezbollah of trying to send gunmen across the UN-demarcated Blue Line and said it held the Lebanese government responsible for what it termed an attempted 'terrorist' attack. Hezbollah and Israel last fought a 33-day war in the summer of 2006. Advertisement  Elsewhere in the Gulf, the United Arab Emirates' Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash tweeted that 'our hearts are with Beirut and its people'.  He posted the tribute alongside an image of Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, illuminated in the colours of the Lebanese flag.  'Our prayers during these difficult hours are that God... protects brotherly Lebanon and the Lebanese to reduce their affliction and heal their wounds,' he wrote.  Gulf countries including Qatar and the UAE maintain close ties with Beirut and have long provided financial aid and diplomatic assistance to mediate Lebanon's political and sectarian divisions.  Bahrain's foreign ministry urged its nationals in Lebanon to contact the ministry's operations centre or Manama's representative in Beirut, while Kuwait ordered its citizens to take extreme caution and stay indoors.  It comes just days before a United Nations tribunal is set to rule on the assassination of the country's former PM Rafik Hariri.  The house of his son, Saad Hariri, who also led the country, was damaged by the blast but he was confirmed safe.  Save the Children said in a statement that members of their team on the ground in the city have reported entire streets destroyed and children unaccounted for.  Despite the charity's offices in the city being badly damaged, they have pledged that a rapid response team is ready to offer support.  Jad Sakr, Save the Children's country director in Lebanon, said: 'We are shocked and devastated by the explosion today.  'The death toll may not be known for several days but we do know is that in a disaster like this, children may be hurt, shocked and separated from their parents.  'Our child protection teams are ready to support the government's efforts, which will almost certainly go on for several days to come.  'It is vital that children and their families get access to the services they urgently need, including medical care and physical and emotional protection.'  He added: 'The incident could not have occurred at a worst time and has hit communities who were already suffering from the impact of the Covid-19 crisis and the economic deterioration.  'Beirut's main port, now completely damaged, is vital for much of the food, grains and fuel that Lebanon imports, and families will immediately feel the shortage in basic needs as a result of this tragedy.'

The huge explosion in port warehouses near the city centre as killed more than 100 people, injured over 4,000 and sent shockwaves that shattered windows, smashed masonry and shook the ground.  Lebanon's interior minister said initial information indicated highly explosive material, seized years ago, that had been stored at the port had blown up. Israel, which has fought several wars with Lebanon, denied any role.  'Israel has approached Lebanon through international security and diplomatic channels and has offered the Lebanese government medical and humanitarian assistance,' a written statement from Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz and Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said.  The offer comes after two weeks of heightened tensions between the rival neighbours, which involved a series of border clashes between the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) and Hezbollah on Israel's northern frontier.  Earlier this month, Israel accused Hezbollah of trying to send gunmen across the UN-demarcated Blue Line and said it held the Lebanese government responsible for what it termed an attempted 'terrorist' attack.  Lebanon's interior minister said initial information indicated highly explosive material, seized years ago, that had been stored at the port had blown up  There have been numerous similar border spats in recent years but the most recent full-scale conflict broke out between the two sides in 2006 after Hezbollah killed eight Israeli soldiers and kidnapped two, sparking the 34-day Israel-Lebanon war.  Hezbollah launched rockets at its southern neighbour and Israel returned fire, bombing Lebanese towns, villages and key infrastructure targets.  The conflict ended inconclusively and the two sides are still, technically, at war. Lebanon is one of 31 UN member states that does not recognise Israel's existence as a state.  International aid in the form of emergency workers and medical personnel is already on its way to Lebanon.  France says it is sending two planes with dozens of emergency workers, a mobile medical unit and 15 tons of aid. French President Emmanuel Macron's office says the aid should allow for the treatment of some 500 victims.  French peacekeepers stationed in Lebanon, a former French protectorate, have been helping since the explosions, Macron's office said.  Jordan says a military field hospital including all necessary personnel will be dispatched, according to the Royal Court. Egypt has opened a field hospital in Beirut to receive the wounded.  Czech Interior Minister Jan Hamacek says Lebanon has accepted an offer to send a team of 37 rescuers with sniffer dogs to Beirut. Denmark says it is ready to provide humanitarian assistance to Lebanon, and Greece says it is ready to help Lebanese authorities 'with all means at its disposal.'  Prime Minister Hassan Diab, in a short televised speech, has appealed to all countries and friends of Lebanon to extend help to the small nation, saying: 'We are witnessing a real catastrophe.' He reiterated his pledge that those responsible for the massive explosion at Beirut's port will pay the price, without commenting on the cause.  Diab's speech came the morning after the blast killed at least 100 people and wounded thousands.  Smoke was still rising from the port Wednesday morning. Major downtown streets were littered with debris and damaged vehicles, and building facades were blown out.  Lebanese Red Cross official George Kettaneh said at least 100 people were killed and more than 4,000 were wounded, and said the toll could rise further.  After yesterday's explosion, Shi'ite Iran, the main backer of militant political party Hezbollah, also offered support, as did Tehran's regional rival Saudi Arabia, a leading Sunni power.  'What we are witnessing is a huge catastrophe,' the head of Lebanon's Red Cross George Kettani told broadcaster Mayadeen. 'There are victims and casualties everywhere.'  Hours after the blast, which struck shortly after 6 p.m. (1500 GMT), a fire still blazed in the port district, casting an orange glow across the night sky as helicopters hovered and ambulance sirens sounded across the capital.  A security source said victims were taken for treatment outside the city because Beirut hospitals were packed with wounded. Ambulances from the north and south of the country and the Bekaa valley to the east were called in to help.  The blast was so big that some residents in the city, where memories of heavy shelling during the 1975 to 1990 civil war live on, thought an earthquake had struck. Dazed, weeping and wounded people walked through streets searching for relatives.  'I promise you that this catastrophe will not pass without accountability,' Prime Minister Hassan Diab told the nation.  'Those responsible will pay the price,' he said in his televised address, adding that details about the 'dangerous warehouse' would be made public.  The interior minister told Al Jadeed TV that ammonium nitrate had been stored at the port since 2014.  The U.S. embassy in Beirut warned residents in the city about reports of toxic gases released by the blast, urging people to stay indoors and wear masks if available.  Footage of the explosion shared by residents on social media showed a column of smoke rising from the port followed by an enormous blast, sending up a white cloud and a fireball into the sky. Those filming the incident from high buildings 2 km (one mile) from the port were thrown backwards by the shock.  It was not immediately clear what caused the initial blaze on Tuesday that set off the blast.  Lebanon's health minister said more than 50 people had been killed and more than 2,750 injured. Lebanon's Red Cross said hundreds of people had been taken to hospitals.  The governor of Beirut port told Sky News a team of firefighters, who were battling the initial blaze, had 'disappeared' after the explosion.  President Michel Aoun called for an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday and said a two-week state of emergency should be declared. He said it was 'unacceptable' that 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were stored for six years without safety measures.  The prime minister called for a day of mourning.  The explosion occurred three days before a U.N.-backed court is due to deliver a verdict in the trial of four suspects from the Shi'ite Muslim group Hezbollah over a 2005 bombing which killed former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and 21 others.  Hariri was killed by a huge truck bomb on the same waterfront, about 2 km (about one mile) from the port.  Western countries including the United States, Britain and France also said they were ready to assist.  Images showed port buildings reduced to tangled masonry, devastating the main entry point to a country that relies on food imports to feed its population of more than 6 million.  It threatens a new humanitarian crisis in a nation that hosts hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees and which is already grappling with economic meltdown under one of the world's biggest debt burdens.  Residents said glass was broken in neighbourhoods on Beirut's Mediterranean coast and inland suburbs several kms (miles) away. In Cyprus, a Mediterranean island 110 miles (180 km) across the sea from Beirut, residents heard the blast.

As police and soldiers converged on surrounding streets to mark the first day of the hard lockdown, hundreds of shoppers packed into a popular inner-city market.  The Queen Victoria Market, on the outskirts of the CBD, was bustling with people on Thursday as shoppers ventured out of their homes under glorious winter sunshine to rub shoulders with masked strangers.  Daily Mail Australia saw scores of market shoppers thumbing their noses at social distancing laws while picking up fresh fruit and vegetables in the outdoor section of the market.  Crowds flocked to the Queen Victoria Market in Melbourne to stock up on fresh fruit and vegetables on Thursday  Shoppers at the market all wore masks but it was near impossible to keep your distance among the crowds  Shoppers gathered at the Queen Victoria Market on Thursday  Shoppers appeared to have little fear of the coronavirus outbreak at a busy Melbourne market on Thursday  The mind boggling display came amid devastating news from Premier Daniel Andrews that Victoria had recorded 471 new cases of coronavirus and eight more deaths.  Two men in their 60s, three men and two women in their 80s, and one woman in her 90s are among the deaths.  A total of 7449 active cases remain with 575 Victorians in hospital with the virus - 42 of those in intensive care.  Daily Mail Australia watched market shoppers jostle for space among the crowded lanes on Thursday.  Along the footpath, police and soldiers walked a perimeter of the market without stepping foot inside to question anyone.  Although one market worker told Daily Mail Australia officers had attended the market that morning while it was quieter.  'They didn't buy anything,' she said.  The influx of shoppers will no doubt come as a major concern to Deputy Chief Health Officer Allen Cheng, who said on Thursday he hoped to see a decrease in current COVID numbers over the next 10 days.  Meanwhile, on the streets surrounding the busy market, police accompanied by soldiers patrolled neighbouring businesses ensuring that only essential places remained open.  The new lockdown conditions have forced the closure of companies in the entertainment, retail, travel and other sectors and is expected to put 250,000 people out of work.  Employees allowed to work on-site now have to show a permit or official work ID if they are by stopped police to prove they can leave their homes, or face fines of up to $99,123 for businesses and up to $19,826 for individuals.  On Thursday, police hit the streets of Melbourne to enforce the law.  Police sources have told Daily Mail Australia it is a daunting task for rank and file officers, who are effectively tasked with questioning anyone they remotely suspect could be breaching the lockdown laws.  Between 8pm and 5am, residents are only allowed to leave their house for work and essential health, care or safety reasons.  Police teams of two were accompanied by four soldiers in full camouflage gear as they patrolled the streets of Melbourne.  They were seen stopping everyone from construction workers to homeless people they found sleeping on the streets.  Citizens who claimed to be workers were asked to produce proof that they were essential workers with specific signed documents they received from their employer.  Protective Services Officers arrest a man on William Street in Melbourne on Thursday  Police, accompanied by soldiers, question a worker on the streets of Melbourne on Thursday  A homeless man was surrounded by police and soldiers as he was questioned on Thursday near the Queen Victoria Market  A Melbourne City Council parking inspector issues another fine on the streets of Melbourne on Thursday  Essential workers had struggled to obtain the documents amid the state government website collapsing and slow workplace action to sign and return the now essential documents.  While many of those who failed to produce the document on Thursday left with a warning, they are not expected to get lucky twice.  Police have been told to produce lists of those that have been approached and by the close of the week will likely include a list of those they have fined.  Daily Mail Australia staff were among those questioned and asked to produce the essential workers document on Thursday.  The police action coincided with the release of footage showing a dramatic takedown of a mum for breaking lockdown restrictions in Hoppers Crossing, west of Melbourne.  Confronting video, filmed by her daughter, showed the blonde woman screaming as the officers held her face-down on the footpath and handcuffed her arms behind her back.  It was claimed they had been standing 'with a poster about Russian politics' when she was pinned down, before both women were issued a $1,652 fine each for breaching coronavirus restrictions.  Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton issued a warning to anyone refusing to follow the rules.  'If you're not doing the right thing, we will not hesitate to issue infringements, to arrest you, to detain you where it's appropriate.'

Road traffic in Melbourne is now ruled almost exclusively by delivery vans and construction vehicles.  Hardly a shop remains open except for a few cafes that continue to feed the teams of flouro-wearing workers.

The Duchess, said friends, wanted a sympathetic ear for her tale of perceived woe at the hands of the Royal Family and the British Press.  And no one âdoes sympatheticâ or understands pain like Ellen DeGeneres, Queen of Daytime TV and a presenter with an unmatched reputation for saccharine niceness and empathy.  Her piercing blue eyes appear to be perpetually welling with tears of compassion, especially when she exhorts viewers to âbe kind to one anotherâ â her trademark catchphrase, delivered at the end of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, which has been running for 17 years.  No one âdoes sympatheticâ or understands pain like Ellen DeGeneres (left with her wife, actress Portia de Rossi), Queen of Daytime TV and a presenter with an unmatched reputation for saccharine niceness and empathy  She and the Duchess seemed to be made for each other. And, of course, they were already friends. DeGeneres, 62, visited the Sussexes in London and even got to hold baby Archie.  Meghan has credited DeGeneres with persuading her to adopt a dog when they once bumped into each other at a Los Angeles animal shelter.  As the Sussexes made headlines around the world for their decision to step down from royal duties, DeGeneres defended the couple on her show.  âI see them get attacked and itâs not fair,â she gushed. âThey are two of the most down-to-earth, compassionate people; theyâre doing so much good for the world.â  But she didnât get the gig â so far no one has managed to secure a place on a sofa for that heart-to-heart with Harry and Meghan.  In Ellenâs case, it now looks as though she never will.  In the most vertiginous Hollywood fall from grace for years, Ellen DeGeneres, who is worth around Â£254 million, is being torn to pieces by the fans who once idolised her â particularly after she came out as gay in 1997, an admission that caused a temporary blip in her career trajectory but soon had her on the cover of Time Magazine under the headline âDaring to be Realâ.  For it turns out that Ellen is perhaps not quite as nice as everyone thought.  In the most vertiginous Hollywood fall from grace for years, Ellen DeGeneres (right, with singer Taylor Swift), who is worth around Â£254 million, is being torn to pieces by the fans who once idolised her  Warners Bros, which owns the production company that makes The Ellen DeGeneres Show for NBC, has begun an investigation after at least 36 past and present staff accused her of presiding over a toxic workplace rife with racism, bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment, as reported by news website Buzzfeed.  The official investigation so far has found âsome deficiencies related to the showâs day-to-day managementâ.  Some staff said theyâd been sacked after taking days off to attend funerals. âHer âbe kindâ bull**** only happens when the cameras are on. Itâs all for show,â said an employee.  Warner Bros, which according to Forbes makes Â£27 million a year from her show, insists DeGeneres herself isnât under investigation â three of her producers face accusations of bullying and sexual misconduct.  Warners Bros, which owns the production company that makes The Ellen DeGeneres Show for NBC, has begun an investigation after at least 36 past and present staff accused her of presiding over a toxic workplace rife with racism, bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment  However, some allegations have focused specifically on her. She sent an email to staff, expressing surprise that their workplace wasnât a âplace of happinessâ and pledging to âcorrect the issuesâ.  DeGeneres is not accused of any of the offences, but she said in her email: âMy name is on the show and everything we do, and I take responsibility for that.â  Several ex-employees told Buzzfeed they were surprised she hadnât heard the rumours about the accused producers as she works so closely with them.  âItâs very hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that she doesnât hear the same whispers,â said one. âUnless she really is in this bubble.â  Industry insiders insist DeGeneres will tough it out, but sheâs reportedly âcrushedâ by the controversy and the threatened demise of her glittering career as ratings plummeted from 4.2 million per episode to a record low of 1.2 million last month.  Replacement hosts including Jennifer Aniston and British comedian James Corden have been mooted although, as the show was DeGeneresâs idea, it might just be scrapped.  So where did it all go wrong? Ellenâs travails began in mid-March, as much of the U.S. went into lockdown looking for distractions.  American comedian Kevin Porter tweeted that Ellen was ânotoriously the meanest person aliveâ, and offered to give $2 to charity for every example someone shared.  Ellen DeGeneres (pictured) will come back to host her show's 18th season as investigations into allegations of a toxic workplace continue  He said he made his fateful tweet for no particular reason, telling the New York Post: âIt was just a thought I had rolling out of bed â it seemed like a fun, creative way to raise money for charity.â  Many assumed that Porter was joking â but as he received 2,700 responses to his request, the devastating stories came thick and fast. One woman, a former waitress, claimed DeGeneres had written to her boss to complain that she had âchipped nail polishâ when she served her.  A former producer on the show, Hedda Muskat, said she had noticed a âculture of fearâ when she started working on it as it launched in 2003. âI had never been around a toxic host,â she said.  When a producer screamed red-faced at a crew member during a meeting, DeGeneres just âgiggledâ and said: âWell, I guess every production needs its dog,â Ms Muskat recalled.  Neil Breen, a former executive producer of an Australian breakfast show, claimed DeGeneresâs team gave him extraordinary rules for dealing with her when she appeared on his programme in 2013.  âThe producers called us aside and said: âOK, this is how itâs going to work here this morning, Neil â no one is to talk to Ellen. You donât talk to her, you donât approach her, you donât look at her. Sheâll come in, sheâll sit down, sheâll talk to Richard [the showâs host] and then Ellen will leave.â  âI donât know if sheâs a nice person or not . . . but I can tell you, the people who worked with her walked on eggshells the whole time.â  Others have simply confirmed that DeGeneresâs alleged âunpleasantness âis one of Hollywoodâs worst-kept secrets.  âWhen you move to LA, the first two things that happen are you get a parking ticket and someone who once worked for Ellen will tell you a story about how sheâs a monster,â said writer and comedian Dan Sheehan.  Ellen DeGeneres has had her worst ratings ever amid ongoing scandal that her show has made for a toxic work culture rife with bullying, racism and sexual harassment  The celebrities who have weighed in against DeGeneres dispel any notion that itâs simply disgruntled staff trying to bring her down.  Brad Garrett, star of the hit comedy series Everybody Loves Raymond, claimed on Twitter that her unpleasantness was âcommon knowledgeâ. He said: âSorry, but it comes from the top. Know more than one who were treated horribly by her.â  Actress and director Lea Thompson, who starred in the Back To The Future films, agreed with him, saying: âTrue story, it is.â  Unfortunately for DeGeneres, the row has broken just as ordinary Americans have been infected by a new mood of cynicism towards their usually revered celebrities, who have shown how out of touch and pampered they are as the rest of the country suffers.  During lockdown, her staff complained that she had hired a cheaper, non-unionised freelance crew to record her segments from home while they were expected to take a 60 per cent pay cut even while the show was still airing.  In July, staffers on the syndicated daytime talk show had cited a number of the show's executive producers in their complaints, including Kevin Leman and Ed Glavin. Ellen was reportedly joined by executive producers Andy Lassner, Mary Connelly and Derek Westervelt and senior staff members to 'address' the issues Monday  DeGeneres, who reportedly earns $50 million (Â£38 million) a year from the show plus some $40 million (Â£31 million) from other sources, caused further annoyance when she compared being stuck at home to âbeing in jailâ â just as she posted smug Instagram videos of the Â£20 million Balinese-style mansion, near Santa Barbara, that she shares with her actress wife of 12 years, Portia de Rossi, 47.  Last October, she was spotted laughing and chatting with former President George W. Bush at an American football game, causing gay rights campaigners to attack her for socialising with a president who had opposed gay marriage.  In contrast, when DeGeneres had Caitlyn Jenner on the show, she berated her for being a Republican.  The star who, until recently, could do no wrong in the eyes of liberal America can now do nothing right and talk on social media revolves around whether or not she can avoid having her show â and indeed her status â âcancelledâ.  It comes shortly after reports that the show held a call with staffers on Monday to discuss how it will move forward amid the accusations  The daughter of a speech therapist mother and insurance agent father, both of whom were Christian Scientists, DeGeneres has previously revealed how her step-father molested her when she was 15 or 16. She started out as a stand-up comedian in her native Louisiana, breaking into film and TV in the late Eighties.  In 1997, her sitcom, Ellen, was at the height of its popularity when she decided to come out as a lesbian on the ABC show â which was a surprise even to her mother.  The TV network put a parental warning before each episode and the following year, cancelled the series amid rumours that family-friendly Disney, ABCâs owner, was uncomfortable about her sexuality.  DeGeneres, who often cites her personal woes when under attack (as she did in her latest email to staff), complained to an interviewer that sheâd always felt like an outsider.  Within six years, however, the âoutsiderâ was back and soon dominated the daytime TV schedules.  In her present predicament, whinging about her personal strife is unlikely to play well â given her vast fortune and a power list of friends that includes the Obamas and Bill Gates.  America is reeling in shock at revelations about the dark side of a much-loved celebrity, but to be fair the clues have long been there.  In December 2018 she told an interviewer she was bored of being âniceâ and felt âboxed inâ by her reputation for kindnessâ â although she dismissed rumours she was horrible to her staff as âliesâ.  Her passive-aggressive streak often shows itself on screen, such as when she relentlessly badgered singer Taylor Swift to reveal who her boyfriends were, bullied Mariah Carey into admitting she was pregnant, or when she hauled an embarrassed member of the audience on stage after she was secretly filmed taking more than her allotted share of Ellen-related freebies before the show.  Occasionally, her high-handedness has backfired, such as when she pulled up Fifty Shades Of Grey star Dakota Johnson for not inviting her to her 30th birthday party.  âActually, thatâs not the truth, Ellen â you were invited,â Johnson corrected her sweetly but firmly. Ellen was visibly rattled â and particularly when it emerged sheâd been heading that day to Texas for that football game with Mr Bush.  A string of past celebrity guests â including singer Katy Perry and actors Ashton Kutcher, Diane Keaton and Alec Baldwin â have rallied in support of DeGeneres, but their protestations that she was never nasty to them has only hardened the current anti-celebrity feeling. Of course DeGeneres is going to be nice to big stars, chorus her detractors.  Being an insufferable diva is hardly unusual in Hollywood but DeGeneres seems to have sealed her fate by basing her appeal on being the exact opposite. But then Tinseltown has an inglorious history of tolerating monsters â as long as theyâre successful.  TV industry observers believe Warner Bros will, for the moment, do its level best to keep DeGeneres on air. However, expecting her to deliver her âbe kind to one anotherâ homily with a straight face after this farce may be a step too far.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8597533/TOM-LEONARD-Ellen-DeGeneres-facing-savage-backlash-host-insiders.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,168467f3ce9059ce9f174a62fa21874a3bde52525e86b8709681a858f28d3fe2,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Abi was on a bus from Brisbane to Fraser Island when she stopped to get painkillers in Noosa for what she thought was period pain.  The pain escalated quickly and paramedics realised she was about to give birth, despite showing no signs of pregnancy.  On the way to the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, a critical care paramedic with emergency labour experience joined the team and helped deliver the 1.7kg baby in the ambulance.  Abi (left) was on holidays in Queensland with a friend when she started to experience strong pains and didn't realise she was going into labour with Harry (middle), her partner Sam (right) was in Sydney at the time  Pictured: Harry was born weighing 1.7 kg and due to his position and low weight he remained a secret  Advanced Care Paramedic Joanna Cairns said the whole thing was one constant surprise for the team as Harry was born in his amniotic sack.  'Luckily my partner had already seen one of those births as she had a lot of experience, but because Abi didn't know she was pregnant we didn't know if Harry was a full-term baby.'  The father Sam was travelling with his brother in Sydney and was able to get a flight to be with his new bub within five hours.  Over the next few weeks, hospital staff were able to determine Harry was close to full term due to his feeding habits and other milestones.  Ms Cairns said the new parents were able to stay with a family friend in Brisbane who was a midwife which 'was absolutely amazing,' they also received help finding baby supplies.  Harry received an Australian birth certificate but had to wait for his visa and passport before the family could travel home. They arrived back in the U.K. in August.  Ms Cairns described the experience as a once in a lifetime opportunity and 'one of the best days of my lives that we were absolutely blessed to be a part of.'  One of the paramedics praised the young parents on Facebook on Thursday (pictured) and called the new parents 'absolute champions' for all of the challenges they have faced  Some people were shocked Abi was able to carry the baby without knowing she was pregnant, but other mothers quickly defended her by sharing their own stories  A Queensland Ambulance Service Facebook post over the delivery sparked some debate online about the surprise pregnancy.  Ms Cairns explained that when she first saw Abi she wasn't showing and there were no normal signs of pregnancy.  'Harry's spine was in line with Abiâs so that changes the position, and he was tiny. In hindsight Abi said she was more fatigued than normal but that was it.'

These 'troubling emotions' and their link to climate change have been studied by University of Colombia researchers for the British Ecological Society.  In the first of its kind study to focus on children and teenagers connecting with nature, the team conducted a full review of other studies, articles and books.  Children and teenagers were triggered by the natural world and their inability to control what was happening to the 'unravelling biosphere', the team said.  The authors found that measures currently used to connect children to the natural world can help others cope with feelings of fear linked to climate change.  These 'troubling emotions' and their link to climate change have been studied by University of Colombia researchers for the British Ecological Society. Stock image  Within the past generation children's lives have largely moved indoors with the loss of free-ranging exploration of the natural world, the team said.  'In response, many conservation organisations advocate connecting children with nature, and there has been rising interest in measuring young people's connectedness with nature,' authors wrote.  The review found that connecting with nature has many positive benefits for the wellbeing of a young person including improving health and happiness.  However, it wasn't universally positive, according to study author Dr Louise Chawla, who said connecting with nature was a 'complex experience' for many teenagers.  In the first of its kind study to focus on children and teenagers connecting with nature, the team conducted a full review of other studies, articles and books  Many children know they are inheriting a changing world that is likely to get worse and this leads them to feelings of anxiety and despair, said Chawla.  That doesn't mean it was all bad news, the team say that despite the strong emotions, there are significant benefits from being outdoors more often.  'There is strong evidence that children are happier, healthier, function better, know more about the environment, and are more likely to take action to protect the natural world when they spend time in nature,' Chawla said.  Several studies found that children's connection with nature increased with time spent in natural environments.  This new study, which involved multiple pieces of literature, found time spent in the great outdoors was a 'predictor' for active care for nature in adulthood.  The findings support strategies and policies that ensure that young people have access to wild areas, parks, gardens, green neighbourhoods, and naturalised grounds at schools, the team said.  For those who are triggered when out in nature by the feeling of despair they 'can't fix climate change' that despair reduces the chance they'll take any action.  The review found an 'overlap' in the strategies used to increase children's feelings of connection with nature and supporting them with the feelings of despair.  Professor Chawla said that these strategies include helping young people learn what they can do to protect the natural world.  Many children know they are inheriting a changing world that is likely to get worse and this leads them to feelings of anxiety and despair, said Chawla. Stock image  This is working both as individuals and working collectively with others, she said.  The Research covered in the review found that young people are more likely to believe a better world is possible when friends, family and teachers listen sympathetically to their fears and give them a safe space to share their emotions.  Chawla said that one of the most surprising findings from the review was the 'complete disconnect' between researchers studying the benefits of childhood connection to nature and those studying responses to environmental threats.  She added: 'People who study children's connection with nature and those who study their coping with environmental risk and loss have been pursuing separate directions without referencing or engaging with each other.  'I am arguing that researchers on both sides need to be paying attention to each other's work and learning from each other'.

More than 900 volunteers with a common form of recurrent MS were given shots of ofatumumab, an drug designed to alter the immune system, over the course of about one-and-a-half years, on average.  Within the first year of treatment, patients were having fewer flare-ups and their blood work showed far fewer signs of inflammation.  By the second year of treatment, nearly 90 percent had no symptoms at all.  MS is not technically fatal, but there is no cure and for many people flare-ups get worse over time and can become debilitating.  The newly-released results of the University of California, San Francisco-led trial for Novartis's drug suggest that relief from the crippling pain of MS could be less than a year away, if the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepts the company's application for approval.  A new drug called ofatumumab targets immune B cells, believed to trigger the attacks on nerve coatings that make the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis debilitating. In the second year of treatment with the new drug, 90% of patients had no relapses  More than 2.3 million people around the world live with MS, including nearly one million in the US.  Up until the last 20 years, nothing really stood in the way of the progression of the disease.  Now, there are a handful of treatments that can help reduce the number and severity of relapses, but many still need a cane, walker or other assistance to walk within 15 years of diagnosis.  The immune systems of people with MS go haywire, attacking the protective covering of nerves, called the myelin sheath.  Like the plastic the insulates wires so that nothing interrupts the flow of electrical signals through them, myelin ensures smooth, uninterrupted communication between the body and brain via nerves in the brain and spinal cord.  Attacks on this protective covering disrupt these signals, leading to pain and lost mobility.  The irregular activity of the immune system also seems to cause inflammation, further exacerbating the aches and nerve pain of MS.  Attacks from misguided immune cells damage the nerves, leaving scar tissues, or lesions, in their wake.  These lesions are a hallmark of the disease.  MS has three primary types: relapsing, primary progressive and secondary progressive.  WHAT IS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS? Multiple sclerosis (known as MS) is a condition in which the immune system attacks the body and causes nerve damage to the brain and spinal cord. It is an incurable, lifelong condition. Symptoms can be mild in some, and in others more extreme causing severe disability. MS affects 2.3 million people worldwide - including around one million in the US, and 100,000 in the UK. It is more than twice as common in women as it is in men. A person is usually diagnosed in their 20s and 30s. The condition is more commonly diagnosed in people of European ancestry. The cause isn't clear. There may be genes associated with it, but it is not directly hereditary. Smoking and low vitamin D levels are also linked to MS. Symptoms include fatigue, difficulty walking, vision problems, bladder problems, numbness or tingling, muscle stiffness and spasms, problems with balance and co-ordination, and problems with thinking, learning and planning. The majority of sufferers will have episodes of symptoms which go away and come back, while some have ones which get gradually worse over time. Symptoms can be managed with medication and therapy. The condition shortens the average life expectancy by around five to 10 years. Advertisement  People with primary progressive MS (PPMS) don't have relapses, but instead only get worse and worse after their symptoms first emerge. It only effects 15 percent of all people diagnosed with MS, and progresses at different speeds for different patients.  Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is far and away the most common for, affecting 85 percent of all people diagnosed. This form comes and goes, with flare-ups, or 'attacks,' that subside.  Some people's attacks become progressively worse, while others remain about the same over time.  Some people with RRMS will eventually develop secondary progress MS (SPMS) which eventually stops remitting, and only progresses.  Ofatumumab is designed to treat RRMS, the most common form.  It targets B cells, immune cell that scientists believe are involved in the attacks on myelin in several ways.  Ofatumumab modifies the way that B cells behave, and appeared in the newly published phase 3 trial to largely or entirely stop MS activity.  The trial was led by UCSF but conducted at 385 sites across 37 countries worldwide, comparing the new drug to teriflunomide, an approved drug commonly prescribed to MS patients.  Ofatumumab far outperformed teriflunomide, a daily pill.  The new drug, which patients can give themselves with an auto-injector pen once a month, cut the number of relapses the patients on it had in half, compared to the pill.  The patients were kept on their respective regimens for an average of 1.6 years. In the second year, the nine out of 10 of the more than 900 patients on ofatumumab didn't seem to be having any disease progression.  Plus, they had fewer brain lesions and less inflammation.  'Given the effectiveness we saw in this study with near-complete elimination of inflammation and scarring in myelin-rich areas of the brain, along with the minimal side effects, the use of either of these therapies is most attractive as first-line treatment for most MS patients,' said corresponding study author Dr Stephen Hauser, a UCSF neuroscientist who has worked on MS treatments for decades.  On the heels of the study, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, Novartis is seeking FDA approval for their new drug.  'While there is not yet a cure, a generation ago MS patients typically became cane- or crutch-dependent within 15 or 20 years, but now they often are spared from significant disability,' Dr Hauser said.  'The improvement in MS treatment, especially with drugs that specifically target B cells, is one of the great success stories of medicine.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-8597577/Experimental-MS-drug-prevents-relapses-nine-10-patients.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,ed4036ac3d52b4752cc2a3d24816c6e407b235548d84a585961f22c946ee8181,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The rare silver coin from the 12th century was discovered by metal detectorist Graeme Rushton near the site of the 1141 Battle of Lincoln. It depicts Stephen, King of England from 1135 to 1154, and his wife Matilda.  The 50-year-old had been searching a field near Lincolnshire's border with South Yorkshire and dug down about 6ins before uncovering the Stephen and Matilda penny.  The Stephen and Matilda penny - an extremely rare 12th century silver penny which is tipped to sell for Â£10,000 after being discovered in a ploughed field by a metal detectorist  At first Mr Rushton, who owns a metal detecting shop, did not recognise the coin, so he took it home for safekeeping.  It was only a year later when he decided to contact the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge about it that he became aware of the significance of his discovery.  Mr Rushton said: 'It was only my second visit to the site which had just been ploughed and flattened.  'After about 45 minutes walking up a slight rise in the field, I got a signal, and after digging down 5 to 6 inches, I uncovered the coin which at first I didn't recognise.  'It was only after showing pictures of it to the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge that I realised how significant the discovery was.  'It is quite exciting. I will share the money with the landowner and I've not really thought about what I'd do with the rest.  'For me, the most interesting thing is uncovering a piece of history. I've been detecting for 40 years and that still gives me a buzz.'  The coin, which was minted in York in the early 1140s, has standing figures of Stephen and Matilda facing each other supporting a tall spectre between them.  One side of the coin, which Graeme Rushton, 55, did not recognise at first but took home for safekeeping and decided to contact the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge a year later  For almost all of his reign Stephen fought against his cousin, another Matilda, who had been the nominated heir to the throne.  The English Royalist barons supported Stephen while the Angevin French supporters backed Matilda.  The coin was found was not far from where the Battle of Lincoln took place in February 1141 between Stephen and Matilda's half brother Robert, Earl of Gloucester.  Stephen was defeated, captured and imprisoned for six months in Bristol Castle before an exchange enabled him to be released.  During this time, his wife Matilda, a very powerful woman in her own right, actively campaigned for him to be let go.  The other side of the coin, showing standing figures of Stephen and Matilda facing each other supporting a tall spectre between them  The civil war ended in 1153 when Stephen accepted Matilda's son Henry as his heir. He became Henry II, founder of the Plantagenet dynasty which ruled until 1485.  Graeme is now selling the coin, which is thought to be one of only 25 in existence, with London-based auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb.  Nigel Mills, antiquities specialist at Dix Noonan Webb, said it was 'special' to find this type of coin still intact and not badly damaged.  He said: 'There is some contention about whether it is Stephen's wife Queen Matilda or his cousin Matilda who is on the coin with him.  'However, we believe the person is his wife Matilda as it would be unusual for him to choose to have the picture of a cousin he was fighting with on there.  'The Queen Matilda actively campaigned for his release when he was imprisoned in Bristol Castle after the Battle of Lincoln.  'She was a very wealthy lady and Stephen's marriage to her made him very powerful. There are an estimated 25 examples of this coin in existence but a lot of them are badly damaged and fragmented.  'The fact that this one is intact makes it quite special. It was minted in York in a very continental style so likely by a foreign engraver.'  The sale takes place on September 16.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8598125/Rare-12th-century-silver-penny-expected-sell-10-000-picked-field.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,8e39a36ee4e837f88cd5e69fd4bc5308f8e9dbdab69bf9c1d5cb49ea6ae0a471,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The US President said he had a âbig and tough talkâ with the Prime Minister, and threatened to stop doing business with Britain if he went ahead with his plan.  He said this forced Mr Johnson to change his mind and âterminateâ the deal with the Chinese firm. The President, in an interview with Fox News yesterday, boasted: âThe UK, they were set to buy the Huawei system.  âI had a big talk and a tough talk with Boris and I said if you do that system you can forget about Scotland Yard, frankly, because we canât do business with you. And they were all set to do it and they terminated it.â  Donald Trump has claimed he forced Boris Johnson to change his stance on allowing Chinese telecoms firm Huawei access to Britainâs 5G network  It is understood that by âScotland Yardâ, Mr Trump was actually referring to the intelligence agencies and threats to stop sharing intelligence with Britain.  He also said Italy was set to sign up the Huawei system and then terminated it, and added: âAustralia has been great from the beginning, Iâll tell you what, theyâve been a great ally.â Asked if there would be a summit, he said: âWeâre very unified. These countries are almost as angry as I am at the plague being released into their country.  âChina stopped the plague from going into China but they didnât stop the plague from going into Europe and all over the world.  âThose countries have suffered more than we have in many ways, theyâve been decimated.â Mr Trumpâs comments came after his explosive row with the Prime Minister on the phone after he decided in January this year to allow Huawei to help build the UKâs 5G network.  The US President said he had a âbig and tough talkâ with the Prime Minister, and threatened to stop doing business with Britain if he went ahead with his plan  Following that decision, the US slapped sanctions on the firm which led to the UK carrying out a fresh review of their decision.  Then last month Mr Johnson did a U-turn and said Huawei â which the US has accused of spying for China â would be banned from the network by 2027. Mobile phone providers are also banned from buying new Huawei kit after the end of this year.  The decision followed growing security concerns about China and increased tensions over its decision to impose a new security law on Hong Kong, a former British territory.  It also followed a mounting rebellion by Tory MPs who claimed they would vote against any government plans to allow Huawei in to the network. The company has repeatedly denied claims it has been used by China as a back door for spying.  Last month Mr Johnson did a U-turn and said Huawei â which the US has accused of spying for China â would be banned from the network by 2027  As speculation mounted that Britain could reverse its original decision on Huawei, Chinaâs top diplomat in London warned such a move would damage Chinese trust in the UK. At a virtual press briefing in London, Ambassador Liu Xiaoming warned Mr Johnson âyou cannot have a golden era if you treat China as an enemyâ.  Liu also defended his countryâs new national security law and slammed the UKâs offer to give up to 3million Hong Kong nationals a path to citizenship, describing the move as a gross interference in Chinaâs affairs.  He said a ban on Huawei would have many consequences, including damaging the UKâs reputation as âa business-friendly, open, transparent environmentâ.  Telecoms experts have warned previously that any Government attempt to force them to remove Huawei kit from the networks too quickly could lead to mass UK phone signal blackouts.

A high court judge ruled that locking up Jean Gibbs, 60, would not stop her false claims against Methodist minister Charles Gibbs that he had abused their son.  But Mrs Justice Lieven ordered the sale of Gibbsâ house so that her former husband, 70, can raise money to pay his legal bills.  A high court judge ruled that locking up Jean Gibbs (pictured), 60, would not stop her false claims against Methodist minister Charles Gibbs that he had abused their son  Mr Gibbs, who now lives on the Isles of Scilly, said his ex-wife had repeatedly accused him of abusing their now grown-up son.  She had breached judgesâ orders not to make such claims and he wanted her jailed for contempt.  She had previously been ordered by courts to halt her bid to destroy the reputation of the Charlie Gibbs (pictured) and force him out of his job  Mrs Justice Lieven, who analysed the case at hearings in the Family Division of the High Court in London, has ruled in his favour.  But she concluded that jailing Gibbs, of Attleborough, Norfolk, would not halt the âvendettaâ.  Another judge imposed a nine-month jail term, following an earlier application by Mr Gibbs, three years ago.  Gibbs had spent four-and-a-half months in jail and had ârecommencedâ sending emails as soon as she came out.  The judge said she had decided that the best way to protect Mr Gibbs was to publish a ruling which showed the truth.  Gibbs had publicised âthe most lurid allegationsâ to as wide an audience as possible, said the judge.  This had a devastating impact on Mr Gibbsâ quality of life and his ministry.  âMr Gibbs applied to commit his ex-wife to prison for breaching two orders of the court that she should not publish allegations that he had abused their son 20 years ago,â said Mr Justice Lieven in her ruling, which was published yesterday.  The judge added: âI have come to the clear conclusion that Mrs Gibbsâ allegations are not true.  Reverend Charlie Gibbs (pictured) believed his ex-wife had succeeded in wrecking his career  'She frequently alleges that various people have believed her when on examination this is not true.â  Mrs Justice Lieven said jailing Gibbs would not persuade her to end the campaign.  She added: âI therefore consider the more effective remedy is for me to publish a full and detailed judgment, so that Mr Gibbs can distribute this to anyone who has been sent Mrs Gibbsâ allegations.â  She added: âI have also ordered the sale of Mrs Gibbsâ house to pay the costs of the various proceedings Mr Gibbs has been forced to bring.â",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8598045/Clergymans-ex-wife-spared-jail-waging-vendetta-lies-against-former-husband.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,83f20207fbfd13c8c75d923a670e50f0fc95c4f76f16c4b46a6118365efe3f48,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

IâVE BEEN engaged three times: once in my teens, which naturally dissolved; once in my 20s, but he called it off; and to my husband, who I split with nine years ago. I had my daughter with a friend shortly afterwards, although he was never going to be involved.  I tend to date people Iâve met through friends and Iâm not on dating sites. I trust I will connect with those Iâm meant to meet.  Pre-Date Nerves?  I come across as confident but Iâm quite shy, so I was nervous. Luckily I was busy and didnât have time to think about the date. I was late and arrived all hot and bothered. I wore trousers and a jumper as I wanted to be honest about how I dress.  First Impressions?  Alistair was waiting outside, and I thought he might be a waiter as he was wearing black and white, but he quickly introduced himself. He is a stereotypically good-looking chap, but he didnât ignite my spark.  Easy To Talk To?  We had the table for two hours and I was concerned the date might drag on, but the time flew by.  Iâm vegetarian and said Iâd looked at the menu online for meat-free options. Alistair was understanding, but not inquisitive. We shared a Greek platter, but I requested that the lamb was served separately.  We both work in homeless prevention in the probation sector and I wouldnât be surprised if our paths crossed professionally. I asked about his upbringing, too, and he seemed happy to open up.  Embarrassing Moments?  No, but we had to have our temperatures taken before going in and I worried I might be too hot.  Did Sparks Fly?  Not for me. I got a text saying that my parking had expired, so I needed to leave quite quickly. I said Iâd be happy to stay in contact.  Did You Kiss?  No, but I blew him a friendly kiss when I left as a Covid-19 alternative to a peck on the cheek.  What do you think he thought of you?  If he is honest, heâll say we didnât have a connection, but I can be flirty so I hope I didnât come across as romantically interested. I suspect he wants a relationship that could end in marriage. He referred to âusâ a few times, and seemed keen to plan a second date, but I just wanted to get to know him over the meal.

There was a moment when I thought, âSheâs not coming!â, but I was relieved when she arrived ten minutes later. She put me at ease with her warm nature, and was open and easy-going.  Easy to talk to?  We both work with homeless people so we had a lot to talk about. Julie has recently completed a law degree, and has already started temporary work in the legal field. I found it interesting as I have a degree in criminal justice probation myself.  We talked about our travels and how we are both exploring more of Britain due to the pandemic. Julie wants to visit the Welsh coast, while I want to see Whitby and Robin Hoodâs Bay in Yorkshire.  I like going to gigs and festivals, but our musical tastes donât match â she likes acoustic music.  Embarrassing moments?  Julie could only stay for two hours and she had to leave rather quickly. When she left it seemed like sheâd done a runner as I hadnât paid for the bill yet, which was awkward. The date ended too abruptly for me, but I stayed to settle the bill.  Did sparks fly?  Itâs difficult to gauge, as it was a new experience for both of us. I do like Julie and I find her attractive, but she has a busy life. She is a mum, runs a business and works full-time.  Did you kiss?  No, but I asked for her number and she blew me an air kiss.  What do you think she thought of you?  That I am good to talk to.

2020-08-06 13:17:40.596679,"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 21:33:18 GMT","As word spreads about the joys of artisan butter, why it's time for you to... Learn to churn","Weâve all gone mad for fancy breads over the past few months. If you werenât making sourdough, what did you do with yourself in lockdown?  But to go with that lovely loaf, you need a truly superior spread, which is why foodies have turned to gourmet âartisanâ butter in their droves. So, what does it taste like, and is it any different to your standard Anchor or Lurpak?  WHATâS BETTER BUTTER?  Whether butter is made on an industrial scale in a factory or hand-mixed at home, itâs all created in the same way.  Cream is churned until it separates into fat solids, which become the butter and liquid buttermilk. This liquid is drained off, then the butter is rinsed and shaped into pats.  If you're bored of your usual salted butter there are plenty of alternatives available including anchovy butter to pair with lamb and whisky and bone marrow-infused butter for steak  What makes artisan butter different is the quality of milk thatâs used. Itâs made in small batches with strict controls over the ingredients.  The breed of cow, the time of year, and hundreds of other tiny factors can all have a profound effect on flavour and texture.  Butter made with Irish milk, for example, is often a startling, almost luminous yellow colour thanks to the amount of beta carotene in the grass, a factor dictated by the local climate.  Ben Ambridge, chef and owner of The Foxâs Revenge restaurant in Newquay, Cornwall, says: âCornish dairy farms are invariably on the coast, which means rain clouds bring in nutrients from the sea to feed the grass. Their cows produce milk that makes incredible butter.â  Cows living in Cornwall are said to produce the best tasting butter says chef Ben Ambridge  FABULOUS FLAVOURS  Once, butter came in two flavours: salted or not. Whip in a bit of garlic and you had a high culinary treat.  But now crafty butter makers are creating flavour combinations that make butter a highlight, instead of just an accompaniment.  Pop into high-end restaurants, local delis and farmersâ markets this summer and you can expect craft butter infused with everything from bone marrow to lobster, seaweed, rose petals or treacle.  Chef Ben Ambridge makes his own whisky and bone marrow-infused butter to enhance the flavours of his steaks, and anchovy butter for lamb.  GOOD FOR YOU  There are even tangy, âculturedâ butters, which are fermented, meaning theyâre packed with bacteria supposed to be good for your gut. These have a stronger taste than supermarket spread.  To make cultured butter, the milk is soured with lactic cultures â a bit like yoghurt â before being churned.  Cultured butter has even become a course of its own at restaurants such as The Court, a membersâ club in Soho, and at The Dairy restaurant (temporarily closed) in South London.  DO A TASTE TEST  Super fresh, most craft butters have a shorter-than-usual shelf life, so you wonât often find them at the supermarket. But you can order online, or try making your own!  TRY A RECIPE  Regular butter by Alan Kingston at Glenilen Farm, Co Cork  1. Place 400ml double cream in a stand mixer (or, shake the cream in a screw-top jar) until it starts to separate into globules of butter and buttermilk.  2. Strain off the buttermilk, then rinse the butter with cold water until it runs clear.  3. Strain again, and knead in the flavourings. Two teaspoons of salt is traditional, or you can whip in Marmite, herbs, cinnamon or anything else you fancy.  ...OR CULTURED BUTTER  Cultured butter by George Lang at The Cheese Merchant in Surrey  1. Put 500g crÃ¨me fraÃ®che in a bowl and whisk for three minutes, until it starts to separate. Pour away any buttermilk.  2. The solids will look like butter, but will taste sour due to buttermilk residue. To get rid of it, put the butter into a bowl of cold water and mash with a fork for 30 seconds. Sieve.  3. Repeat this four or five times until the water stops turning cloudy as you mash.  4. Mix in sea salt or flavourings such as chives, garlic, and parsley. Refrigerate and use within a week.

Iâm left with all the neutrals that work hardest, because these pale tones are to summer what black is to winter.  Theyâre simple and easy to wear, plus more flattering to the skin. Designers The Row and Jil Sander brought this minimalist look to this seasonâs catwalk: brands known for being quietly elegant, not wanting to shout with logos or flamboyance.  SOFT AND NATURAL  Apparently, neutrals are calming, and perhaps thatâs why I love them in my busy life despite having to keep a distance from Play-Doh and sticky hands from three young children.  Camilla Ridley-Day shared advice for embracing the summer neutrals trend.

These sustainable choices are not only on trend but they have longevity.  TRY A âCUSTARD CREAMâ  Try mixing these tones for a look I call the custard cream: part warm biscuit shades, part pale cream. All these neutrals are from the same family, so you canât get it wrong if you experiment with different coloured tops, bottoms, jackets or accessories. These wideleg jeans from Baukjen (right) have replaced my faithful skinnies, and theyâre so comfortable I wish Iâd ditched them sooner.  GO FOR A SLIM CUT  If you like a smarter finish for trousers, try Luisa Ceranoâs slimtailored cappuccino version, which have an excellent cut and will work well if youâre back in the office.

Ballerina skirts are pretty, but they just don't have the same edge. And a full-length maxi skirt is nice, but it lacks a certain punch.  A ruffled, tiered flamenco skirt, on the other hand, cannot be beaten. My fixation started in a resort on the Costa Brava in the mid-1980s.  I was on my first holiday abroad, and the excitement was overwhelming. All-you-can-eat buffets! Swimming pools outside your door!

At the airport, I forced my parents to buy me a child's version and wore it day in, day out.  Like a mini, flammable version of Carmen Miranda, I'd pull it on and dance to Madonna's La Isla Bonita.  As an adult, I have every variation. There's my prized skirt by Stella Jean, each tier made from a different African-print cotton.  Or my more subdued camel cotton wrap skirt from J.

I wear mine with a vintage rock tee and flat sandals for casual drinks, or dial them up with a frou-frou blouse.  They are also chic with a masculine shirt in mid-blue or white. If you're curvy, don't be afraid of all-over tiers.  Pick one made of light fabric, such as this Whistles style (second from left). A peplum version that fits snugly over your stomach before flaring into a tier, like this spotted one from H&M (third from left), is surprisingly flattering, too.  If it's got a high waist that sits well, it will hold in curves. For hot days, a looser, boho take is great â I love this cobalt version by H&M (second from right).  But my heart belongs to Essentiel Antwerp's red ruffled style (centre), which has more than a hint of 1980s Dynasty glamour.

New data published by Zoopla showed rents in inner and outer London have dropped 3 per cent since the beginning of the year, and are down 1.4 per cent in the past 12 months.  It compares with a significantly smaller drop of 1 per cent since January 1 and an increase of 2.2 per cent in the past 12 months for the rest of the country excluding London.  London rental: This two-bed flat in Marsham Street, south-west London is available to rent for Â£1,950 a month via letting agent Vesper  Reduced international travel and tourism, along with an increase in working from home, is to blame for the more recent sharp decline in London rents, according to the property website.  Zoopla said Scotland's financial centre Edinburgh had been affected by the pandemic for similar reasons, with rental growth slowing to 0.2 per cent in the past year.  As well as a reduction in tourism due to the pandemic, Scotland has also seen new policies affecting landlords and the supply of property.  These include discussions about bringing back the ban on AirBnBs in shared staircase buildings, which would affect some parts of Edinburgh.  Zoopla said the rental markets in London and Edinburgh stand apart from other cities in Britain due to a rise in supply in these markets, which is increasing choice for tenants.  This is not being matched by similar levels of demand, leading to downward pressure on rents and the rate of rental growth.  It explained that the decline in international travel and tourism has seen landlords in the capital, especially in central London, shifting away from short lets, thereby increasing supply in the long-let market.  Weaker demand means that as tenancies end, they are being absorbed more slowly, compounding the growth in supply.  It added that the rise of homeworking at many companies, with a slow return to offices over the rest of the year, signal that demand for rental property is likely to remain subdued, especially if unemployment starts to rise.  Commuting data shows that working patterns in London are still far from returning to levels seen back in March.  In addition, the student influx expected as part of the usual seasonal busy period in late summer may not be as large this year as universities migrate towards more online learning, Zoopla said.  Escape to the Cotswolds! This eight-bed house in Chipping Norton is available to rent for Â£10,833 a month via letting agents ATPS  Zoopla suggested that tenants, like homeowners, may have used lockdown as a chance to reassess how and where they are living, further boosting rental market activity.  At the same time, the number of homes for rent has increased since lockdown ended - and is slightly ahead of seasonal trends, with the volume of homes for rent nationally up 7 per cent on this time last year.  By contrast, across much of the rest of Britain, demand for rental homes is still outpacing supply.  Cities such as Rochdale, Sunderland, Bristol, Preston, York and Leicester are all recording annual rental growth of more than 4 per cent.  Zoopla explained how demand has been driven in part by renters reassessing what they want and need from their home during lockdown - and having the flexibility to act on this and move more easily than homeowners.  While some might have decided that they need more space or a garden, others have elected to move location - in some cases moving further away from the office and embracing a longer commute amid more flexible working patterns in the future, it said.  Rent in Bath: This seven-bed house to rent in Bath's Gay Street is available for Â£3,500 a month via Bath City Lets  Levels of affordability for tenants have remained largely unchanged in recent years, with the exception of London, which has become cheaper although rents still eat up almost half of income.  In the capital, the proportion of income needed to cover average monthly rent has fallen to 45 per cent from 54 per cent in September 2014 - although it still remains the most expensive region to rent a home in Britain.  GrÃ¡inne Gilmore, of Zoopla, explained how the future path of annual rental growth will be determined largely by the economic outlook, especially the rise in unemployment and the future path of average earnings.  She added: 'As new rental supply continues to catch up with demand levels, we could see further softening of headline rental growth by the end of the year, although there will be some areas of outperformance.  'Uncertainty continues over how any further outbreaks of Covid will impact the resumption of office life, student life and tourism, and this uncertainty will impact demand in some markets during the rest of the year.'

2020-08-06 13:17:44.843871,"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 12:46:26 GMT",What are the rules about estate agents about wearing masks or gloves?,"I viewed a property for sale as lockdown was easing and the estate agent did not have a mask or gloves - while I was wearing both.  I went on to buy the terrace house, with the agreement that the property was cleaned professionally as it previously had tenants in it.  My request for proof of the professional clean - in the form of a receipt - was declined, with the buyer claiming it was carried out by their private cleaner.  The property remained dirty - included an unflushed toilet - when I went to collect the keys on finally purchasing the property. What are the rules on viewings and presenting cleaned properties during the coronavirus pandemic?  There are strict guidelines in place for the housing market after it reopened on May 13 following the lockdown  MailOnline Property expert Myra Butterworth replies: It is distressing to hear about your viewing and experience of buying a property during the coronavirus pandemic.  There are strict guidelines in place for the housing market after it reopened on May 13 following the lockdown.  For example, the Government says those viewing a property need to wash their hands and viewings can only involve members of a single household.  Without these safety measures in place, viewings are not meant to take place, with most agents adhering to the new guidelines.  NAEA Propertymark, the body that represents estate agents has gone a step further, advising everyone at a viewing to wear gloves and face coverings.  It has previously warned that if its members failed to adhere to its guidelines, the Government may decide to lockdown the housing market once again.  However, this week, it told MailOnline Property that it 'is unable to take disciplinary action against members on this issue'.  Mark Hayward, of NAEA Propertymark, said: The guidance we have provided on property viewings during Covid-19 has been created to overlay Government guidance on house moves and outline the highest standards of best practice to members.  We recommend that members adhere to these safety measures, but we are unable to take disciplinary action against members on this issue. If consumers are uncomfortable about the safety measures in place during a viewing they should feel empowered to speak out.  As always, we continue to stress the importance of all members following the guidelines as closely as possible to ensure the safety of all parties.  's well as government guidance, we encourage all professionals to speak to their representative bodies and familiarise themselves with the guidance that these bodies have prepared for their specific sectors.  People are encouraged to wear masks and gloves during house viewings  Myra Butterworth adds: Those viewing a property need to decide what they are comfortable with as a buyer and set their own boundaries - this may include asking the estate agent to wear a mask or not stepping into the house if they refuse.  Obviously, this would not be in an agent's interests to decline such a sensible reques,t as they could potential miss out on a potential sale, and so hopefully this would be enough to make them wear the appropriate protection.  That said, the risk may vary around the country and according to the type of property you are visiting.  For example, if the property is a mansion in the countryside that has evidently been professionally cleaned, you may be less worried about the risk of catching, or spreading, coronavirus as it is relatively easy to socially distance in this situation.  This may be in contrast to viewing a terrace townhouse or flat in the heart of a town or city. In these circumstances, you may have the added risk of passing potentially dozens of people just to reach the property - such as travelling public transport.  However, the guidelines from NAEA Propertymark are clear that estate agents should be wearing masks and gloves.  The Government also says all surfaces should be cleaned after a viewing. However, there is no legal obligation to prove the property has been cleaned.  In this case, it seems that you were unfortunately the victim of a seller who said one thing and did another.  Perhaps your lawyer was able to get some money off the price to allow for the cleaning that was not done - and then hopefully you will have been able to pay for some professional cleaners to do the work once you had collected the keys and before you moved into the house.  We asked some estate agents for their views on how best viewings should proceed and what actions are taken if masks are not worn. One agent declined to comment.  Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent, said: We are following strict guidelines on viewings and going above and beyond what is requested as we find that most of our vendors and landlords want to see this. Everyone wears masks and gloves on viewings and we are handing them out where they are not available.  We find that those attending a viewing like to know what to expect so we email the seller and the prospective buyer beforehand, setting out what our requirements are, what we expect of them and what they can expect of us so it is very clear. We find that most customers embrace that and are very happy to go along with it.  If we were to find that people ignore our requests - i.e. vendors refuse to vacate the property or at least remove themselves to another part of it, or buyers refuse to wear masks and gloves -, then we will cancel the viewing but so far we have not had to do that.  We are very mindful of the fact that another lockdown would be bad news for the market - business has picked up a lot and we wouldn't want to do anything to compromise that or contribute to the need for the Government to make the rules stricter. We believe most agents take the same stance. We have been told by some vendors and potential buyers that we are stricter than others but we don't mind that.  Guy Gittins, of estate agents Chestertons, said: With masks and other precautions now part of our everyday lives, most people are more than happy to follow our viewings guidelines which have been designed to help us protect both our clients and staff.  Since May, the market has also become increasingly competitive, with far more buyers looking than there are properties available, so people know that they need to follow our guidelines in order to give themselves the best chance of securing a property.  We do of course have instances where people forget to bring their masks, in which case we will provide them. If, for whatever reason, someone is unwilling to wear a mask or follow our guidelines we are still able to offer video and virtual viewings, but under no circumstances will we put our clients or staff at any unnecessary risk.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/property/article-8588285/What-rules-estate-agents-wearing-masks-gloves.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,0e3161f798a5f5a206c0760f02423c22f66d4e82ce541083eb35c57ae041b3f1,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The cheapest three-bedroom family house in London is currently on the market for 'offers in excess of Â£325,000'.  While it has a garden and a modern bathroom, the terrace property generally requires some updating, so buyers will need some extra cash if they want to complete the project.  This three-bedroom terraced house in south-east London's Westhorne Avenue is for sale on Rightmove for 'offers in excess of Â£325,000'  The findings are the latest indication of how unaffordable the capital remains for families despite the coronavirus pandemic.  House prices across the country 'ground to a halt' as the pandemic took hold, according to Nationwide Building Society. It said values dropped 1.4 per cent in June compared to the previous month.  However, while London's housing market has not escaped the effects of the crisis, house prices tend to be higher in the capital compared to the rest of the country and this remains the case.  The average price of a three-bedroom family home in London is Â£605,347, down Â£66,000 on a year earlier, according to property website Zoopla.  It compares to a typical value of a British home, which currently stands at Â£291,055, down Â£25,000 in the past year.  It means the average price of a home in London is still twice the average of a home in Britain.  Zooplaâs house price figures show a 9.8 per cent drop in London, while it says house prices have fallen 7.9 per cent across Britain. The property websiteâs figures are based on its own estimates, calculated using historic data and current local trends.  The Zoopla figures show house prices falling by far more than any other indices, such as the Nationwide house price index â which uses its own mortgage lending data for properties at the post survey approval stage.

The cheapest example of such a property listed on Rightmove is a terrace house in Westhorne Avenue, in South East London. It has an asking price of 'offers in excess of Â£325,000'.  Homes with a lower asking price are available on the site, but they are being sold at auction and so have been ruled out as such properties often end up selling for more. Also not included are boats and caravans.  On Zoopla, the cheapest house for sale in the capital is a three-bedroom terrace in West London's Feltham, with an asking price of Â£340,000.  The Victorian property has an old-fashioned kitchen and an avocado bathroom suite, so some extra cash will also be required to update it.

The housing market reopened after lockdown on 13 May and started to 'recover fairly rapidly' according to Nationwide.  Robert Gardner, chief economist at Nationwide building Society, exclusively told MailOnline Property: 'Mortgage applications started to recover fairly rapidly once lockdown restrictions were eased.  'This trend looks set to continue in the near term as previously planned transactions move forward and as many people reassess their housing needs as a result of life in lockdown, our research suggests more people looking for homes with gardens, more space and a place to work from home.  'The stamp duty holiday will also bring some activity forward.'  'However, the recent resurgence in the market may not last. Most forecasters expect labour market conditions to weaken substantially in the quarters ahead as a result of the after effects of the pandemic and as Government support schemes wind down, which would be likely to dampen housing activity once again.'  Inside, the Feltham has an avocado bathroom suite, which was popular in the 1970s  The front door of the property leads into the large living area, which has a bay window  The Chancellor announced in the mini-budget earlier this month that he would cut stamp duty immediately on main homes costing up to Â£500,000.  The scheme will last for more than eight months, with the new thresholds applying until March 31 next year.  The savings are lower for first-time buyers due to the stamp duty relief already in place for them.

And as you'd expect from that, the Long Barn is a house with a story to tell.  The property is a 200-year old building that was painstakingly converted over four years.  The work started in 2015, with owner Jason Howlett and his three children living in a static caravan on the six-acre rural site just outside of Royal Wootton Bassett, in Wiltshire.  The Long Barn is on the market for 'offers over Â£1.9million' via Richard James estate agents  It was back to basics from the onset, with the family having no mains-connected water or electricity for their first summer at the site.  Mr Howlett bought the plot with the derelict barn for Â£500,000 and then proceeded to spend a further Â£1million renovating it.  By his own admission, he 'overdeveloped' the site, but this was never about making money for him - rather rescuing a building that was 'falling down' and turning it into a family home.  Idyllic countryside property: The Long Barn is near Royal Wootton Bassett, in Wiltshire and features a natural swimming pond  MailOnline Property took an exclusive tour around the property and spoke to Mr Howlett about his passion for the renovation work at The Long Barn.  We arrived on a sunny summer's day when the property couldn't have looked more idyllic or tempting, especially during lockdown when demand is high for large open green spaces - especially if they are private.  And this space is certainly that with equestrian facilities, landscaped gardens and an oxygenated natural pond that is so clear you can swim in it.  â¹ Slide me âº Before and after! The renovation works were started in 2015 and took four years to complete  Taking a closer look: We took an exclusive tour around the property and spoke to the owner Mr Howlett  There was plenty of space to socially distance in the barn's extensive gardens during the lockdown property tour  The property is the perfect place during lockdown as it has wide open spaces including equestrian facilities  Mr Howlett explained why he first bought the property, saying: 'I have always loved barns. I used to live in Woking and I yearned for the country life and ponies.  'I wanted a project and something that was beautiful. I saw it for sale and it needed rescuing. I love rescuing things that are falling down.'  He took his time over the renovation saying he 'didn't want to rush any decisions'.  'I wanted to retain the heritage of the building and merge the old with the new,' he said.  While he had an architect - Simon Chambers of LPC - he did not use an interior designer, instead researching everything himself.  'My first vision was a stainless steel kitchen but I reined it in as it could have been too industrial and masculine. I tried to make it lighter and softer with glass.'  He said: 'The property has a Soho Farmhouse feel to it. For my tastes, I have never seen such a beautiful property and I know every inch of it.  'For example, he points out the stone signs, which are handmade and reveal the chisel where the name was carved out â but only if you look closely enough.'  The 40 foot vaulted kitchen took seven months to complete and includes Â£10,000 worth of taps. And the high quality appliances feature names such as Gaggenau and Miele.  Imagine the two kitchen islands pushed together and the shape aims to replicate that of a Playstation console  â¹ Slide me âº The barn has been transformed to include a wine storage area at the entrance to the kitchen  The family lived on site while the back-to-brick renovation works were taking place  Inside the main bedroom, there is a walk-in wardrobe that took its inspiration from the 1970s children's TV programme Mr Benn  The conversion of the barn provided a lot of space to fill, including this large living area  With his children now at university, it is time for the family to move on.  The property is on the market for offers over Â£1.9million with Richard James estate agents handling the sale.  Mr Howlett said: 'I've met a new partner who lives in the New Forest, so we are moving to that area. The children have all gone to university and so this is too vast for us. It needs a new family who will take it over.'  The property comes with two separate guest cottages that are currently rented out  For many, completing such a project while bringing up children and running a recruitment company based in Surrey's Richmond, would mean they were searching for a quieter life. Perhaps in the shape of a completed house.  But Mr Howlett says he has not been put off doing another build, far from it - although this time he shall be building from scratch to avoid having to deal with a listed building and all the restrictions that go with such a renovation.  There are four bedrooms in the main house at The Long Barn, with a staff flat next to the stables, and two separate guest cottages.  The two cottages are currently rented out until October, having reopened for guests after lockdown on July 4. At their current rate, they are on target to generate an annual income of Â£40,000.  The long stretch of barn (pictured towards the right) houses some of the bedrooms  The entrance hallway currently includes exposed brick-work and timber  The property is in Thornhill, a village within a short distance of Royal Wooton Bassett.  There is easy access by car to the M4, A419 and Swindon railway station. Local schools include Marlborough College, St Mary's Calne and Dauntsey's School in West Lavington.  Alex Hornby, of Richard James estate agents, said: 'This property is tucked away in the Wiltshire countryside and has plenty of enclosed space.  'There is plenty of accommodation and entertaining space for your friends and family. You couldn't wish for much more.'  The property is unrecognizable from five years ago when it was just a derelict barn  With the children now at university, the owner says it is time for a new family to enjoy the property  From the outside, The Long Barn has a similar feel to Soho Farmhouse (pictured)  Tom Parker, at Zoopla, said: 'Lockdown has meant homes with wonderful gardens or swimming pools now come at an even greater premium and for the more discerning buyer space to entertain and separate rooms for guests to stay are an absolute must.  'Surrounded by water on several sides and with a luxurious yet rustic feel throughout, the Long Barn is the perfect rural sanctuary, combining the practicality of benefiting from a short commute to the city with the joy of the countryside.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/property/article-8576917/How-built-dream-home-Wiltshires-1-9M-Long-Barn.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,fa6fcd16a809344d39491948bf4ac4c4d16f4cd1c2e32503d4bf13411b4107ca,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:17:46.892409,"Sun, 02 Aug 2020 21:05:51 GMT","The summer queen: With majestic blue blooms, agapanthus are showstoppers","Hail to the queen of August flowers â the agapanthus. Its cool-blue petals and spring-like foliage are just what you need for freshening up jaded summer planting schemes.  These are majestic plants whose flower clusters are carried on tall, naked stems. That enables you to place them anywhere â Agapanthus Charlotte works well in a border front â without masking the other plants. They're excellent in pots, too.  In borders, they create shellbursts of blue above the general planting. But if naturalised, they become leafy weed-proof carpets, topped with blue.  'Agapanthus' is ancient Greek for 'love flower', which is puzzling. The plants lack aphrodisiac qualities as far as I know, and whatever the shade, blue is hardly an amorous colour.  British gardening expert Nigel Colborn, shared his advice for majestic agapanthus throughout summer. Pictured: Agapanthus Charlotte is compact, perfect for the front of a border  Apart from the occasional albino, all wild agapanthus are blue. Garden varieties come in an extended range of blues, as well as white, violet-purple and bicoloured.  Heights and sizes vary, too, and there are dwarf types with shorter stems. Those are good for troughs or bowls. Varieties can be evergreen or deciduous. Hardiness varies, but in mild areas such as Cornwall, almost all survive winters unaided. In colder regions it's safer to grow varieties known to be hardy.  EASY MANAGEMENT  Agapanthus are wonderfully low-maintenance. Containerised plants need regular watering and occasional repotting. Like most perennials, plants grown in the ground benefit from being lifted and divided every few years.  Most of the hardy varieties die back in winter, though the dead leaves look messy for a while. They're safe outside all year, but benefit from a compost or leafmould mulch. Lay that over the dying foliage in late October.  Less hardy varieties need a thicker, more bulky mulch if grown in the ground. But if grown in containers, those can be trundled into safety or be wrapped up for winter.  In spring, the young leaves can be vulnerable to late frosts. So have fleece handy in late April or early May for protection.  Despite the extra fuss, big evergreen agapanthus are certainly worth growing. In large containers, they're superb with sturdy stems and massive flower heads. Deciduous varieties are better for borders. They blend sweetly with summer perennials such as phloxes, rudbeckias and penstemons.  For best results, grow all agapanthus in well-drained soil in a sunny position. I give my plants a light dressing of bonemeal, just before spring growth begins. To propagate, dig up clumps in spring, split them up and re-plant divisions.  PICK YOUR FAVOURITE  Breeders and selectors have increased the colour range from white through various blues almost to purple or black. Sizes range from dwarf types to whoppers such as Regal Beauty. Flower of Love, one of the deepest blues, has 60cm stems, big flower heads and broad, strappy leaves. It has the RHS Award of Garden Merit, and is hardy over much of the UK â a fine container plant.  For permanent outdoor planting, hardiness is essential. For that, and for reliability you can't beat, try the Headbourne Hybrids. These are a catch-all bunch of hardy deciduous types in a variety of blue shades plus an excellent white.  For more varieties, look up specialists Hoylands nursery at somethingforthegarden.co.uk. Among others, it offers purpleblue Royal Velvet, white and violet Twister and dark, brooding Indigo Dreams. Maybe that one is a true flower of love.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/gardening/article-8585625/The-summer-queen-majestic-blue-blooms-agapanthus-showstoppers.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,51041fcf030726859de59ba02318afb3adb6a711ff75253acacf1a316e305fef,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Robert Wainwright reveals the secrets of Enid Lindeman, one of historyâs most scandalous socialites  Enid on the day of her wedding to first husband Roderick Cameron, 1913      What an entrance!  In August 1948, she stepped on to the main floor of the Casino de Monte Carlo, a silver-haired seductress with turquoise eyes, the action on the tables paused. She always drew attention, often for her fearless style of play as much as for her looks. Legend had it that she had won enough at cards one night to buy the most spectacular home on the CÃ´te dâAzur.  At almost six feet tall, the woman was dressed in a silk evening gown with a three-tiered diamond necklace, her hair crowned with a diamond tiara â a gift from her third husband, Marmaduke the 1st Viscount Furness, to wear at the coronation of an English king. The men at the main table stood as she approached. Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, the third Aga Khan and one of the richest men in the world, smiled at her arrival. âMy dear Enid, could you not be more discreet with your entrance? Next time, please come in black so I might be allowed to get on with the game without the undoubted distraction that your presence at my table is going to create.â  Lady Kenmare, the former Miss Enid Lindeman of Strathfield in Sydney, smiled quietly and sat down. She was ready to play.  Hello (and goodbye) to husband number one  Born Enid Maud on 8 January 1892, Lady Kenmare as she was to become, was the fifth child of Florence and Charles Lindeman, son of the man who had put Australia on the world stage for wine.  She grew up with her six siblings in the southwest Sydney suburb of Strathfield, surrounded by open spaces and secluded beaches, and left school with one goal in life: to marry well. At 21, she met a wealthy middle-aged American businessman named Roderick Cameron. He was immediately smitten by this tall, elegant woman.  It wasnât long before they married and in 1913 a son, Rory William Cameron, was born. But their joy was short-lived: Roderick died of cancer before his son celebrated his first birthday. Back in Australia, the focus of the awful news was on his wife, as the Sydney Morning Herald noted: âThe beautiful girl of 23 who married a millionaire of 45 is now widowed.â  But a year after her husbandâs death, Enid had shed not only her widowâs weeds but her wedding ring. The money from Roderickâs will gave her the freedom to travel and â despite Europe being a war zone â in 1916, she and her son went to London then Paris, where she spent her days as a private ambulance driver for the war effort.  PARIS, CAIROâ¦ AND A BRUSH WITH AN EGYPTIAN KING  France would change Enid. She was no longer the gawky schoolgirl or the shy young wife of a New York businessman who missed her parents. Within a few months of her arrival in Paris, word got back to the London War Office that she was causing havoc among the officers. Some had even threatened suicide because she wouldnât accept their advances. Such was her effect on men that, years later, there would be a phone call to Enidâs house from a Mrs Erskine, whose husband, an ageing retired general, was dying. âWhere is Enid going to be buried when she dies?â the woman asked. Surprised, the servant who answered the phone replied that she didnât know. âWell, go ask her,â Mrs Erskine demanded. âMy husband has always loved her and as he was not able to be beside her in life, he wants to be beside her in death. Tell Enid that she must make up her mind as I donât intend to keep digging him up.â  It didnât take Enid long to find her next partner. On Monday, 18 June 1917 at the British Embassy in Paris, 25-year-old Enid married Frederick Cavendish, a man 15 years older than her and already, arguably, married to the army. He stayed with his regiment while Enid travelled between London and Paris with Rory. Then a few years after they married, the family relocated to Cairo, Egypt, when Frederickâs regiment was reassigned.  Enid thrived in the exotic mystery of the Middle East. She recalled it later as one of the most memorable times of her life, with picnics beside the Pyramids and languid journeys drifting down the Nile; grand balls in sandstone mansions and moonlit horse races into the Sahara.  On 4 November 1922 the British archaeologist Howard Carter uncovered the tomb of the Egyptian boy-king Tutankhamun. His financial sponsor, the Earl of Carnarvon, permitted only a select few to visit the chamber with its chariot and throne glinting with gold. Enid Cavendish was among them, having met and entranced the earl. Not that she was alone in her marital transgressions. The nature of Enid and Frederickâs marriage was pragmatic. Despite their mutual affairs she gave birth to a daughter, Patricia Enid, on 30 June 1925. Romantic love may have been absent but Enid was clearly content in the relationship, with the arrival 15 months later of another son, Caryll. However, the marriage came to an abrupt end on 8 December 1931, when Frederick was discovered by his valet collapsed in the sitting room of the apartment. Heâd had a cerebral haemorrhage.  From left: A portrait of Enidâs first husband Roderick Cameron; out walking with second husband Frederick Cavendish, and jetting off on honeymoon with third husband Marmaduke Furness  JEWELS, FLOWERS, ROLLS-ROYCE: THIRD TIME LUCKY, SURELY?  Marmaduke Furness was holding a winning poker hand when he first spotted Enid Cavendish at the Le Touquet casino in the late summer of 1932. He immediately lost interest in the cards: âI have seen many beautiful women but, from the moment Enid entered the room, my heart stopped,â he later told friends.  Marmaduke was one of the worldâs richest men, thanks to his father and the dubious fortunes of war, for which his factories built and supplied ships. He then sold off most of the family business in a deal worth millions.  Following his first glimpse of Enid at the casino, he spent the next week showering her with gifts. He sent her jewels and flowers and put his chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce at her disposal. She sent everything back. But when he discovered that she was booked to travel back to London on the Golden Arrow, the luxury train between London and Paris, he convinced her to cancel the ticket and fly with him on his private plane. When they arrived in London, he took Enid to dinner at the Savoy, where he presented her with the title deeds to not just the apartment she was renting in Chelsea, but the entire building. Enid was hooked. âThere was nothing in the world that Duke was not prepared to give me,â she told friends many years later. âOf all the men who loved me, and some were as rich as Duke, only he laid the world at my feet.â They married quietly on 3 August 1933 at Westminster register office. Marmaduke insisted that his new wife hand over her inherited Cameron fortune as part of the marriage agreement. Enidâs decision to trade her cherished independence for a promise of comfort, however luxurious, would prove a significant mistake and one she would regret.  Whoops, there goes another one (husband)  It turned out Marmaduke had no intention of taking responsibility for Enidâs children. At his house, Rory, Patricia and Caryll were kept out of sight, restricted to an hour in the morning with their mother. Marmaduke and Enid would travel to play in the casinos around the world from the airstrip and hangar he had built at their home. They also flew to Africa, where Duke bought a safari lodge. In Kenya there was a fleet of Rolls-Royce limousines waiting and a champagne bar.  Now in her 40s, Enid was drawing more attention than ever. But what had begun as adulation had now become skewed into an almost constant fit of jealous rage. One night at the BarriÃ¨re casino, Marmaduke became enraged when he saw another gambler flirting with Enid. He challenged the man to a duel â pistols at dawn. Desperate to end the conflict, Enid delivered an ultimatum to Marmaduke. She had rented a villa near Nice and she would take the children there for the rest of the summer. Marmaduke could follow but if he stayed, the marriage was over. He put his pistols away and trailed after his wife, offering to buy her a summer palace â La Fiorentina â as a sign of his love. Enidâs choice would change her life.  Then war broke out and, in 1940, Marmaduke died. Sought by the German authorities (for aiding the escape of prisoners from the nearby detention camp), Enid and Patricia dashed across the Spanish border, Patricaâs long hair rolled into a series of curls, each concealing the last of their paper money.  Enidâs arrival back in London caused a sensation. She was a heroine: a woman who had remained in her home, defiant of Nazi Germany until the last possible moment, providing aid to the Resistance. But she also had a cloud of suspicion over her head about the death of her wealthy husband and his will.  They moved into a London townhouse. The Blitz was over but bombs were still being dropped. One fell on their garage. Enid, typically laissez faire, only reported it several months later.  She still changed lovers as casually as she did handbags. When she took her bath each night, the maids would lay out a negligee and nightgown to match the colour of the bed sheets â changed daily and sprayed with her favourite eau de parfum, Jean Patouâs Joy. A second set would also be laid out âin case Lady Enid wants to change during the nightâ.  Time to say âI doââ¦ Yet again  At the age of 50, Enid was looking for security rather than a passionate affair. Both arrived in the rather large figure of Valentine Castlerosse, sixth Earl of Kenmare. Each had something the other desired. Valentine needed money to bankroll his lifestyle and Enid was apparently on the verge of acquiring a substantial share of the Furness estate. Enid needed a social patron and an earl was a step up the social ladder from Viscount Marmaduke Furness. They seemed to be the perfect match.  They married and Valentineâs comings and goings from Enidâs townhouse became the norm. He disliked the staircases, claiming they would be the death of him because of his bad heart, âif the sex doesnât finish me off firstâ. But he was happy with Enid â despite their lack of money. The papers called her a âpenniless peeressâ and she took a job in Debenhams as the court case surrounding her inheritance dragged on. Their marriage was surrounded by drama when, at 51, Enid fell pregnant. Doubters were convinced Enid had fabricated this to protect her title. In the end, she decided to have an abortion. But Valentineâs heart did give out (not during sex) and Enid was left a widow for the fourth time.  From left: With her fourth husband Valentine Castlerosse, with her son Rory in the late 60s and as Lady Kenmare in 1968  Finally, one of the worldâs richest (single) women  After Valentineâs death, Enid inherited her share of Marmadukeâs estate. She returned to her beloved French palace, La Fiorentina, which became the most famous house on one of the most famous headlands in the world. The visitors book dripped with stardust from John F Kennedy to Frank Sinatra. Even royalty visited: Prince Ranier and Grace Kelly and Edward, Duke of Windsor with his wife Wallis Simpson.  It was here during one drawn-out bridge session that friend and neighbour, playwright William Somerset Maugham, gave Enid the nickname by which she would come to be remembered. Wondering aloud about her name â Lady Kenmare â and the fact that all four husbands had died, he suggested that a more apt title would be Lady Killmore.  Enid Lindeman had been raised to be beautiful and desirable, and had succeeded beyond expectation. Where once she equated love with having to enthral a man who was prepared to buy her anything she desired, Enid now understood that the greatest gift she could be given was to have an equal place alongside, rather than behind, a man. She never married again and in later life she relocated to South Africa. She died from pneumonia in 1973 aged 81, having rattled through most of her fortune. Always very generous (and absentminded: she used to store diamond necklaces in tissue boxes), she lavished houses, farms, planes and boats on her children.

What would give off the right vibes? My friend Andrea in Belfast managed to get my address off my assistant Nic, and has just sent me an oversized Bella Freud white T-shirt with the slogan âThese shoes are: Uber. Sit down. Uber onlyâ. Which pretty much sums me up. Or used to, given Iâve spent the past decade in wellies. Iâm thinking of layering it under an Alexander Wang slouchy blazer, teamed with toothpick jeans that give me deep vein thrombosis.  Reason? Iâm starting to think I was too hasty rejecting him before for being short. Iâve been watching Married at First Sight Australia and marvelling not just at so much footage of Nige, aka the photographer Hunk* (Series 4, Episode 5, 44 minutes in, if youâre remotely curious), but also at how ridiculous it is for the potential brides to turn up their noses at perfectly handsome, young, fit grooms who know how to start a lawnmower just because theyâre not 6ft 2in.  Maybe I am too fussy. An acquaintanceâs partner is facing jail for fraud. Andrea texted: âI bet youâre now thinking Davidâs ponytail wasnât so bad, after all.â  Then David, who doesnât follow the news unless itâs about me, texted to say, âI donât look so bad now, do I?â  I replied, âIâm not looking for ânot quite so badâ.â  I think we are setting a bit of a low bar here.  Then I had a brainwave. Google! Yes! I didnât train as an investigative reporter for nothing! So I googled the new man, P. I discovered his age (three years older than me), a photo of his house (not a s***hole, overlooking the sea**), and a photo of him âat workâ. I sent the photo to Nic.  âIs this P?â  âYup.â  âDoesnât look too bad at all.â  Anyway, then I got some bad news. I emailed the medi-spa nearest to me and was told, âWe can book you in for treatments for the scalp and from the neck down.

Sandals, Terry de Havilland  Sophie Ellis-Bextor opens the door to me with a toddler in her arms â smiley 18-month-old Mickey â and her four-year-old son Jesse behind her, his hair a deep shade of copper. âYou have the most beautiful hair Iâve ever seen,â I tell him, genuinely quite dazzled, and he replies bashfully, âWell, Iâve just had it cut.â  Welcome to Sophieâs world: a large and glittering house in West London, packed to the rafters with kitsch, toys, cats and boys. I donât know how many cats are around, but the boys number five: Mickey, Jesse, eight-year-old Ray, 11-year-old Kit and 16-year-old Sonny. Managing the lot are the singer, her husband Richard Jones (bass guitar player with The Feeling and the supergroup Loup GarouX), and a nanny, who joins them Monday to Friday during the working day. âI used to have a nanny who was with us all the time, and to be honest I felt like it was too much,â says Sophie. âItâs fine if itâs my thing that I think about 24 hours a day, but I think itâs healthy for other people to have their own life away from it all. Itâs five kids â itâs a lot.â  It certainly is, and itâs hard to imagine how demanding it must have been during lockdown, when the only one missing was the nanny. The public got a glimpse of this when Sophie performed a weekly series of âkitchen discosâ, broadcasting them live via Instagram, her husband filming on his phone. They launched these shows during the bleakest part of the pandemic, and the good will that emanated from them was enormously cheering. She would appear in a sequined jumpsuit or rainbow-striped dress, a pair of platforms at the end of her mile-long legs, and would serenade the camera while children wandered casually in and out of view. Sometimes her teenage son would jump in to rescue the baby from a trailing wire, or one of the boys would need a cuddle, and their mother would pull them in close, keeping her other hand on the mic.  Murdering the dancefloor with Ray and Richard. Jumpsuit, Rosa Bloom  It was charming chaos. The music encompassed hits from Sophieâs back catalogue such as âMurder on the Dancefloorâ and âTake Me Homeâ â or âStay at Homeâ, as she rechristened it â but also crowd-pleasing covers and theatrical numbers from shows such as Grease. For the audience, it offered uplifting relief from the frightening reality of the time: climbing death rates and isolation. It was comfort music, I say. âExactly,â she agrees. âAnd discoâs always had that for me anyway. Itâs so euphoric and joyful, and itâs complex. In disco you can have the most painful, heartbreaking scenarios, but theyâre in among something that makes you want to put your hands in the air and sing along. I think music can allow you the space to feel joy and anxiety at once.â  I am delighted to find that one end of their large kitchen still looks very much as it did, with the disco ball and a half-deflated helium balloon in place over the sofa. She confirms that itâs more or less always like this, perhaps minus the tinsel curtain. Colour and fun are everywhere in the house, from the framed retro artworks filling every wall, to the pinball machine in pride of place. At the other end of the kitchen, a diner-style menu-board for the kids bears the words, âBe polite or no service.â  Leaving the children with the nanny, Sophie and I head out to chat on a bench in the park. Sheâs wearing an embroidered navy dress and a red fluffy cardigan, with red lipstick that has mostly worn off; at 41, sheâs truly beautiful, with very pale green eyes. Despite what weâve seen from her on Instagram, it hasnât been an easy time. For one thing, there was the fall from her bike in June that left her in hospital with a gory head wound. When I mention it, though, she brushes it off with, âI cannot dine out on that any more.â Then she adds, âI mean, I donât recommend cycling off a towpath â it did hurt.â  But an accident that might have been a big deal in a quieter year seems rather trivial to Sophie in 2020. Her stepfather John â married to her mother, the novelist and former Blue Peter presenter Janet Ellis â has stage-four lung cancer (sadly, he passed away last month just a few days after our interview). âHe hasnât really left the house for anything other than medical reasons since January, and I think that brought home the worry of what was going on,â she explains.  18-month-old Mickey takes over the vocals. dress, Roland Mouret at selfridges.com.

Itâs such a weird, torturous thing isnât it for human beings, if you say that hanging out with someone you love is the one thing that might actually endanger them? How can you wrap your head around that?â  She hasnât been thrilled with the government messaging around the virus. ââStay at homeâ is clear and concise and all ages get it. âStay alertâ? I hardly ever feel alert. I donât feel alert now.  And weâve all shown weâre good at following guidelines that make sense, but you canât keep bending it for people. Look at the effect when the rules were made flexible.â She seems to be referring obliquely to the Dominic Cummings/Barnard Castle debacle. âWe all thought, âOh well, if we could have been going off and having day trips all this time, why was I staying at home and not seeing my mum, who lives ten minutes away?â I found that really tough.â  The kitchen discos were as much for her and the family as they were for the audience. âIt was Richardâs idea.

And Richard was, like, âWell, why donât we do a gig here, and it gives us something to do and a bit of fun?â I think we missed everybody.â  Performing during that time, even via Instagram, gave her a huge sense of connection, she says. âI honestly donât know what I would have done if I hadnât had that, and I donât know how it would have been for our family, because it became really precious.â Sheâs now planning a Kitchen Disco Tour next May (there will also be an album, out this October), and hopes it will offer audiences a cathartic experience. âI want to provide a place where people can get lost in the moment. I want them to walk out of there and go, âOh my goodness, I didnât know how much I needed that.ââ  The final kitchen disco at the end of may  It was no surprise to her boys to see her dressed up and performing; Mickey sleeps in the room where she keeps her fantastic stage wardrobe, and theyâve all been with her to festivals, gigs and recording studios. It was clear from their low-key presence in the kitchen discos (she left it up to them whether they wanted to be there or not) that theyâre not fazed by it. âThe older Iâve got, the more the me at home and the me on stage is the same person anyway,â she says. Her first solo album came out almost 20 years ago; this one will be her eighth.  Sheâs also just celebrated her 15th wedding anniversary with Richard. Theirs was a whirlwind romance that stuck: âI found out I was having a baby after only about six weeks,â she says with a smile. âWeâd known each other for a while â heâd been in my band â but weâd literally just started dating and I hadnât even really told anybody.â Sonny was born two months prematurely, thus arriving only eight months after theyâd got together.  And theyâve now got him almost to adulthood, I say. âYeah, and heâs lovely; heâs his own person. You know, parenthood is so much more reactive than I ever thought,â she says. âI thought it was all about what you put in. Itâs not. I realised it the day I had him: I looked at this tiny baby and I thought, âOh my goodness, youâre Sonny, and now Iâve got to help you show me who you are and what you need from me.ââ  To raise five children while continually working is no mean feat, and she mentions that there were tense moments during lockdown. But she and Richard clearly make a good team. âI guess the thing thatâs often not celebrated as much in long-term relationships â and I think this goes for family members, friends, all sorts of relationships where thereâs love â is that we actually really like each other,â she says. âI really like who Richard is, and I respect him and I like spending time with him.â  She took an extended break after Sonny came along, following a difficult birth. âBut to be honest, the more babies Iâve had and the older Iâve got, the more confident Iâve become about what I can do around being pregnant and having kids,â she says. âIâve been better with the last couple at just keeping going with the work either side of it. I have a job where I can basically call the shots a bit. Iâm very lucky with that and I totally exploit it. Also I like it if I do a big gig and Iâm six months pregnant â I feel quite clever,â she laughs.  The challenges of this complicated life have inspired Sophieâs new project â the podcast Spinning Plates, on which she chats to other working mums, including Caitlin Moran, Fearne Cotton, the mummy blogger Candice Brathwaite, and her own mother Janet. âIâve got such a brilliant array of women, and honestly it feels like a privilege to sit there for an hour and ask them loads of nosy stuff,â she says. âObviously the springboard is the idea of the working mother, but actually what really unites us is weâre all women, and there are so many things about being a modern womanâ¦ Itâs a rich pot of stuff to go through, really.â  Sophie and Richard celebrating their 15th wedding anniversary in June  She loved having the chance to interview her mum. âIn my head sheâs always been this real trailblazer and very confident. She never seemed to have any guilt with any of her work, and Iâm glad, because it gave me a good role model of âItâs OK for me to be selfish enough to have my work and keep it separate if I want to, and do the things I want to do.â I donât think I would have been confident enough if I hadnât had a mum like that; Iâve struggled a bit to give myself permission sometimes even with that.â  Another chat, with Yvonne Telford, founder of the fashion brand Kemi Telford, made her realise that at times sheâs too self-critical. âShe said she hates it when she hears women say, âOh, Iâm such an idiot,â and I was, like, âGod, I do that all the time.â Even with the podcast, when I first started writing to people I wanted as guests, Iâd say, âDonât worry, I know how it goes â youâre probably too busy to reply.â Then I was, like, what am I doing? Iâm saying to them, âIgnore me!ââ She bursts out laughing. It sounds as though making the podcast might be rather empowering. âYes,â she agrees.  Dress, Roland Mouret at selfridges.com.

2020-08-06 13:17:54.026192,"Sat, 01 Aug 2020 23:02:56 GMT",'Lockdown taught my daughter to live again',"âI will never trust you again,â she spat at me. âAnd when I do kill myself, it will be your fault'  When her badly bullied teenage daughter tried to take her own life, this devastated mother found herself battling with guilt and constant fear. Then the family found a surprise silver liningâ¦  Sitting in a hospital room with my 14-year-old daughter Isobel*, I stared at her tear-stained face with a sickening mix of fear and despair as she wailed that she wanted to die. Putting my head in my hands, guilt washed over me. How had it come to this? Despite loving her so very much, I had failed my only child.  That night, last October, was the lowest point in a hellish year as Isobel struggled with a multitude of emotional problems. First she was horribly bullied â a falling out within her friendship group led to teenagers throughout the school getting involved. Things got nasty. Theyâd crowd around her during lunchtimes, taunting and threatening her. Teachers stepped in, the ringleaders were punished and eventually it stopped. But Isobel was left feeling fundamentally unlikable, with severe trust issues that made friendships difficult.  She also fell behind with her schoolwork as worrying about what awaited her between lessons distracted her in class. Learning, which previously came easily, became another area in which she felt inadequate. To top it all off, sheâd recently started her periods, throwing hormonal upheaval into an already tumultuous mix.  I tried to help, encouraging Isobel to talk about her feelings and hiring a tutor to help her catch up on schoolwork, but she refused to engage. When I reassured her, âThis will pass,â sheâd shake her head, insisting my words proved that I didnât understand. Next, Isobel started refusing to go to school, becoming increasingly socially isolated. Sheâd back out of plans with her friends; offers of shopping trips with me â which she used to enjoy â were rejected. She spent most of her time shut away in her room.  The night that we ended up at hospital, a row in school with her friends had spilled on to social media, attracting an audience. When one boy suggested Isobel might as well kill herself, she took him up on the idea.  This was already my greatest fear â so much so that my husband Nick* had removed the lock from the bathroom door and weâd hidden all medication in a locked chest. That awful evening I went to get some painkillers from the chest and noticed fresh score marks from a failed attempt to prise it open with a knife. As the implications of my discovery sank in, an explosion of splashing and spluttering came from the bathroom above. Charging upstairs I found Isobel in the bath, choking and sobbing hysterically, her long hair plastered across her face as she screamed at me to get out so she could go back to trying to drown herself.  âDid you try to get to the pills?â I asked, trying to suppress the panic rising in my chest. âYes!â she screeched back. When I asked her why, she looked at me, incredulous, and said, âBecause I want to die.â I knew I had to get her to hospital. By now Nick was in the bathroom doorway, frozen in shock. I pulled the plug and covered Isobel in a towel, kneeling beside her as she came out with a devastating stream of words, âIâve written you a noteâ¦ itâs on my phoneâ¦ itâs not your faultâ¦ I donât want to be here any moreâ¦ donât make me stay.â  I could hear Nick quietly sobbing behind me and wanted to yell at him. I resented his emotion. I wanted to cry, too, but didnât dare; if I started I might not be able to stop.  Nick pulled himself together, helping me coax Isobel out of the bathroom and into some clothes, persuading her that we needed to go âsomewhere safeâ. She was calmer now, almost trance-like. I was amazed at how malleable she was as Nick buckled her into the car. He stayed at home â we had our four-year-old nephew staying over, whoâd slept through the whole thing. Throughout the 20-minute journey, Isobel kept quietly repeating her horrible death wish. âIâm not going to let that happen,â I told her, reminding her over and over how loved she was.  It was only after being rushed through triage and taken into a room with a paediatric nurse that Isobel seemed shocked to be in hospital. She became aggressive towards the nurse, snapping when she asked if she knew why she was in hospital. âItâs because I tried to kill myself.â  âDo you still want to kill yourself?â the nurse asked.  âYes.â  When Isobel was told that if she ran off, as she threatened she would, the police would bring her back, she looked at me with fury.  âI will never trust you again,â she spat at me. âAnd when I do kill myself, it will be your fault.â  Nine months have passed since my daughter said those devastating words. They still haunt me, despite Isobelâs mental state having improved dramatically since then. I expect they always will. Thankfully, the dark hopelessness we both felt that night has evaporated. My child, now 15, feels like she has a future again. As astonishing as this might sound, I think lockdown helped to save my daughter. Everything that made lockdown so difficult for most adolescents â no school, no social life â liberated Isobel. The things most teenagers longed for were precisely what she couldnât cope with.  âNow everyone else gets to feel what itâs like to be me,â she declared when lockdown was announced. I saw it as some breathing space â a welcome break from the daily battles of trying to get Isobel into school and an opportunity to just âbeâ for a while. Because I was struggling too. Knowing my child had felt so wretched that death seemed the best option had a profound impact on my sense of self. My boss â Iâm an accountant â had already let me take compassionate leave so that I could focus on Isobel. While this helped, it meant I lost the distraction of work and the validation it gave me. I lost confidence in my parenting skills â scared that if I made mistakes, pushed her too hard, Isobel had the ultimate recourse: suicide.  A sense of being on constant red alert, forever trying to assess my childâs mood, had made relaxation impossible. Depression âsomething Iâd never experienced before â had struck. My brain became foggy. My legs felt like jelly. Simple tasks, such as cooking a meal, had overwhelmed me. I felt permanently on the brink of tears. Iâd longed for something, anything, to change â and suddenly it did, in the form of lockdown. Immediately it helped us both. Like most people, I envisaged a hiatus, almost a holiday. No alarms, no schoolwork, no pressure. My boss furloughed me, meaning I could take more time off but still get paid. Nick, an IT consultant, worked from home, giving a comforting sense of unity.  Of course, I felt selfish for finding positives in a situation where people were dying and livelihoods lost. âAfter what youâve been through,â said my mum, âif you can find some good in all this, then grab hold of it.â She was right. I thought back to the night Isobel tried to hurt herself. After she was admitted to the childrenâs ward, they gave us a room where I was allowed to stay overnight with her, although she refused to even look at me. She slept, but I couldnât. Isobel was remarkably calm when she woke. I was stunned when she gave me a cautious smile. I asked if I could hug her, surprised and relieved when she said yes.  Isobel was seen by the emergency response team for the local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). After two hours of sympathetically talking through her experiences of the past year, the CAMHS worker discharged her. With her feelings validated, Isobel said she no longer felt suicidal. She promised to engage with the local CAMHS team and her first appointment was scheduled for the following week. But for things to feel so calm after the chaos of the previous night was bewildering. When I mentioned this to the CAMHS worker, Isobel said, âI donât feel so mad at everyone now Iâve got my period.â It turns out she had got her period the night before. Later, I thought back to how bad things had been in the run-up to Isobelâs last two periods â the only ones sheâd had at that point. It was just before the second one that Iâd started locking away our pills.  The weeks that followed were hectic: weekly CAMHS appointments; calls at random times of the day from school saying Isobel had broken down in class and needed collecting; pleading for an appointment with our GP to discuss Isobelâs hormones; another premenstrual phase that took her mood so low she told me she couldnât imagine ever feeling happy again.  So yes, when lockdown happened I really was ready to press pause on life as we knew it. Without the spectre of school hanging over Isobel, her mood seemed more level, less erratic. Our GP had also prescribed her a contraceptive pill and that seemed to be helping. He suspected she was suffering from an extreme form of premenstrual syndrome, known to cause catastrophic mood swings and suicidal feelings, and put her on Yasmin â a brand of contraceptive pill proven to help with mood because it can balance fluctuating hormones. The GP also recommended that, instead of taking the usual monthly breaks between packets and menstruating, Isobel should have just four periods a year, so that we could prepare for them. Lockdown brought a calmness to our home.  I was sleeping better and so was Isobel. My legs felt as though they belonged to me again. Before lockdown, I had stopped expecting anything of her â she no longer did chores and didnât even eat with me and Nick. âYou need to muck in with family life again,â I told her. She agreed she would, without any fuss. We worked out a daily timetable together and included a couple of lessons she enjoyed, and she used her prescribed hour of exercise to walk the dog.  Isobelâs mood improved as lockdown continued. On our walks she gradually opened up about the fear and distress she felt when she was being bullied. She joined a virtual yoga class. Her expression stopped being permanently strained. Understandably, as lockdown measures eased, I felt fearful. But when she told me she was going to have a socially distanced meet-up with her friend Lucy* I was thrilled. âLucy has found lockdown really hard,â Isobel revealed when she arrived home. She found comfort in that and they continue to meet up. Lucyâs positive response to her support has been a huge boost to Isobelâs sense of self-worth, as has delivering groceries for her grandparents and making a daily phone call to our elderly neighbours to see if they need help.  Isobel says sheâs looking forward to going back to school in September. She could have gone back for a couple of sessions already but didnât feel ready for that. Apparently, many of her peers also felt the same way. For the first time in a long while I get a sense of her being able to fit back in.  Mentally, sheâs stronger every day; I feel like Iâm getting my daughter back. Is this dramatic change down to her newly settled hormones or the emotional space and renewed sense of value that lockdown gave her? Iâd say itâs a combination of both. I suspect that when the child mental health team re-assesses Isobel theyâll be keen to get her off their books. Iâd like to see how she gets on back at school before I agree to that. But the future looks positive. âI donât want lockdown to last for ever any more,â Isobel told me. âI feel ready to be part of everything again.â I know what she means, because suddenly thatâs how I feel too.  *Names have been changed  For more information and support, visit youngminds.org.uk or call the parents helpline on 0808 802 5544.

To turn this into a Sunday roast, donât add the couscous at the end, swap the potatoes for celeriac and serve with roasted potatoes.

With a small sharp knife, cut about 12 slices into the flesh of the lamb â around one every 1cm on the top then the rest in the side. Put the lamb into a large ovenproof dish. Slice four of the garlic cloves in half and slot them into some of the holes you created in the lamb.  Put the butter in a bowl and add the cumin, coriander, paprika and cinnamon. Grate the remaining two cloves of garlic in and mix together with a spoon until combined.  Push the mixture into any of the holes in the lamb not filled with garlic, then spread the butter all over the top and as much as you can on the sides. Put the potatoes, carrots and mushrooms around the lamb then place in the oven.  For medium lamb, which I think is perfect, cook for 13 minutes for every 450g of meat, plus add 20 minutes on the end. For a 1.2kg leg of lamb a perfect cooking time is about 1 hour. (If you prefer the lamb well done, cook for 20 minutes for every 450g, plus 20 minutes at the end.) Always leave to rest for 10 minutes when cooking is finished.  After the lamb has been in the oven for about 10 minutes, spoon the juices over the vegetables and the lamb then put back into the oven.

This year's biggest stars","Thatâs what we call nightlife! the Milky Way and Perseid meteors make for a spectacular sky  Magical, mind-blowing and better than sex? Stargazing is this yearâs breakout hobby and, as Sadie Nicholas discovers, moonlit picnics are the place to be  Itâs late at night and a group of women are sitting on rugs sipping wine, under an inky sky lit by a dazzling half-moon. But this is not your average garden get-together â this is a âstar partyâ.  Its host is Theresa Cooper, a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society, and her guests are all fledgling astronomers eager to develop their new hobby: stargazing.  Amateur astronomy is booming right now. The British Astronomical Association, which represents hobbyists, reports a huge surge in interest with more people getting in touch during lockdown and visiting the organisationâs YouTube channel for guidance. Meanwhile, some retailers have recorded a 50 per cent rise in sales of telescopes this year.  Stargazingâs popularity has been helped by a dramatic drop in road and air traffic, leading to less air and light pollution â meaning clearer skies that are perfect for spotting stars, planets and faraway galaxies.  âPeople assume that you need expensive telescopes and lots of scientific know-how to take up astronomy, when all you need to get started are your eyes, a pair of binoculars and a dark, clear sky,â says Theresa, who is in her 60s and lives in Bridgend, Wales with her husband.  She works as a volunteer at the Cats Protection Bridgend Adoption Centre and as a totally self-taught stargazer. Theresaâs hobby has taken her all over the world in pursuit of the clearest skies and dazzling constellations, including the deserts of Nevada and California. But she says your garden is a great place to start. âIn fact, visiting dark sites â designated areas with almost no light pollution â can be overwhelming for beginner astronomers, as there are simply too many stars to look at.â  For 41-year-old Louise Hickman in Shropshire, taking up astronomy has been a much-needed outlet. After a tough day at work as a police sergeant, she wraps up warmly, grabs her 4ft telescope and, with her four children tucked up in bed, heads to the garden to stargaze.  âItâs a form of meditation for me. It takes me away from daily life and makes me realise how fragile and small we are in the grand scheme of the universe,â says Louise.  Hobby astronomer Alexandra Browne snapped the stunning Cone Nebula  âAt the beginning of lockdown, when the skies were suddenly clear, I saw Venus and also the Orion constellation, which has lots of mesmerising nebula â incredible interstellar clouds made of dust and gases.  âFor every star in the sky thereâs a network of planets around it, just as there is in our solar system. Itâs mind-boggling and always makes me think, are we alone?â  Fascinated by physics and space at school, Louise began exploring the night sky with binoculars in her 20s and bought her first telescope ten years ago. âIt was a few hundred pounds but I got my moneyâs worth when I was sitting in my garden one night and saw Jupiter. It blew my mind.â  Last year Louise splashed out around Â£275 to upgrade her telescope to a techy-sounding Sky-watcher Skyliner 200P Dobsonian, which has an eight-inch aperture â the bigger the aperture, the more light the lens allows in and the greater detail you can see in the sky. âSince then, Iâve seen Saturn and the Milky Way, which was magical,â she says.  Louise says stargazing is the perfect family hobby. She and her children have a membership with the Shropshire Astronomical Society and enjoy having moonlit picnics. âThe kids all love the International Space Station app [ISS Live Now] which shows live footage of the Earth as the station orbits it,â she adds. âI use Google Skymap for Android, which is GPS based [Apple users should try Skellarium]: you point it at the sky and it shows you where the planets, galaxies and stars are in that very moment.â  Left: Alexandra, a civil servant, with her telescope: âthe enormity of the universe thrills meâ. Right: Preschool worker Vicki Pink has spent Â£2,000 on her current kit  Fellow hobby astronomer Vicki Pink, a 37-year-old preschool worker in Southampton, discovered stargazing in 2016. âI went to a public viewing at our local observatory. They had an absolute beast of a telescope â a Meade 14â. It was so huge I had to climb up a stepladder to look down the eyepiece, and there was Jupiter staring back at me with four of her biggest moons,â says the mum of two.  âThen we looked at a star cluster called the Pleiades, otherwise known as the Seven Sisters. It gave off a beautiful blue hue, which was breathtaking. That night I came home buzzing.â  Her partner Ben surprised her with a telescope that Christmas. âIt was a tiny rickety thing but it gave me my first views of the moon and it couldnât have been more wonderful.â In March 2018, Vicki invested in a better telescope â a Sky-watcher Explorer 130P SynScan AZ GOTO costing more than Â£300 â and bought an âastrocamâ so she could have a go at taking photographs of space. In all, sheâs invested around Â£2,000 in her current kit.  Shooting stars: these Leonid meteors enter our atmosphere at very high speeds  âIâve seen meteors, shooting stars, the International Space Station and even a fireball whipping through the sky,â she says.  âDuring lockdown the atmosphere has been as clear as gin so Iâve seen Jupiter, Saturn, mountains within craters on the moon, plus nebulas and galaxies millions of light years away.â  Like Louise, Vicki finds astronomy relaxing. âItâs totally absorbing and an instant release from the stresses of work and everyday life â it gives you a glimpse of the magic and mystery of space.â  Civil servant Alexandra Browne, 57, has been a hobby astronomer for over a decade, though her fascination began as a child. âI was 11 when  Seeing red: a dazzling photo of Orion Nebula taken by the Hubble Space telescope  I first looked at a nearly full Moon through my dadâs antique brass spyglass,â says Alexandra, who lives in Buckinghamshire with her husband and 20-year-old daughter. Getting her own telescope in 2007, the first sight to take her breath away was Saturn. âIt changes its orientation over the months so sometimes you can see the rings at an angle, rather than edge on. I couldnât take it in.  âSome people actually canât look through a telescope because they feel overwhelmed by the distance and space. But itâs that sense of the enormity of the universe that thrills me.â  Eager to capture those mesmerising sights, she ventured into astrophotography. Over the years sheâs spent more than Â£7,000 on equipment. âIâve been swept away by this frustrating, amazing, mind-blowing and, for me, increasingly expensive hobby, although it doesnât have to be expensive,â she laughs. âIt has taken me years to get to grips with it. My first astrophoto captured the enigmatic Ring Nebula and I literally jumped around screaming, âI did it, I did it!ââ  Alexandraâs biggest telescope measures a metre in length and is a permanent fixture in her conservatory. Sheâs also a member of the Stargazers Lounge website and the Chipping Norton Amateur Astronomy Group.  âMy husband and daughter think Iâm bonkers staying up till 3am stargazing, then feeling rotten the next day, but theyâre wowed by my photographs,â she adds.  âAstronomy is the most therapeutic hobby. And when the perfect image of an object, sometimes millions of light years away, comes up on my laptop screen linked to my telescope, itâs better than sex â itâs out of this world.â  Amazing space: the Helix Nebula in all its glory  WANT TO START STARGAZING?  Royal Astronomical Society fellow Theresa Cooper shares her advice for beginners  DONâT BUY A TELESCOPE (YET)  Telescopes require practice to use properly. Many people find them too complicated and give up. A pair of binoculars and a tripod are cheaper and simpler. Any binoculars you have at home will work but, if you decide to buy a pair, a good size is 10x50. Spend a year observing the sky this way before you invest in a telescope.  DO GET A TORCH AND A STAR CHART  A red-light torch for about Â£10 will help you see where youâre going but wonât affect your night vision (think of red lights on a car dashboard). A planisphere is a star chart that shows you whatâs visible in the sky right now and is only a tenner, too. Learn one constellation and use that to find another, and so on.  PREP YOUR EYES  Before you start, get away from your house and any streetlights. It takes 20 minutes for your eyes to become properly adapted to the dark and less than a second to lose the adaptation if you look at a bright light. If you use a sky app â for Android devices SkEye is good â make sure itâs set to a red-light background (change the settings in the app or via your phoneâs display options).  SPOT MORE THAN STARS  Donât forget about the moon and other planets. Observing the moon as it waxes (grows in brightness) is fascinating. Saturn and Jupiter are close together in the south of the UK after midnight and look stunning â they should be easily seen until November. You should be able to spot some of Jupiterâs largest moons with binoculars.

Blouse, lisou. trousers, roland mouret. Jewellery, Alighieri.  During the early days of my career, I had an editor whose favourite catchphrase was that âassumption is the mother of all mess-upsâ. In fact, he used a less salubrious term than âmess-upsâ but you get the drift.  It was one of those annoying sayings that turned out to be true â and similar to the catchier âwhen you assume, you make an ASS out of U and ME.â  I remember writing a story about celebrity chef Antony Worrall-Thompson (that dates me) and spelling his first name with an erroneous extra âhâ.  âWhy did you do that?â the editor asked.  âI just assumedâ¦â I stuttered.  I was reminded of this recently when I posted on Instagram. The photo was of me in a radio studio, recording a programme, and the post was designed to encourage people to listen. What I hadnât noticed was that there was a plastic bottle of water next to me.  A man pointed it out in the comments. âPlastic bottle,â he wrote, accompanied by a shocked cat face emoji. âNot on brand.â  The comment was clearly intended to shame me for using a plastic bottle as everyone knows that David Attenborough told us sea life was dying because of people like me. And on one level the commenter was right. On that day, I had placed the importance of the oceans below my need for San Pellegrino. But what bothered me about it was the assumptions this total stranger had made.  First of all: I had never met this man. How on earth would he be able to magically intuit what was âon brandâ for me? For all he knew, I was a climate change denier who owned stocks in a single-use plastic manufacturer. (I am not, but he didnât know me well enough to draw that conclusion.)  The problem with social media is that it has a necessarily flattening effect: you share aspects of your life, but not the whole messy texture of it. And yet there is an assumption that the edited highlights reel is all of it rather than a selective glimpse. This means that followers such as the water bottle man (WBM) believe they know all of you when they donât. WBM thought he knew where I stood on everything, including plastic, and if he didnât actually know, then he was certain of what I should think, which was exactly the same as him.  A picture can only convey so much truth. What WBM couldnât have known was that the day before that photograph was taken, Iâd had an ocular migraine â a scary experience involving partial vision loss. I was still feeling fragile, so I had googled what could help and one of the suggestions was carbonated water. I wanted to do a good job on the radio and I was nervous about getting another migraine and being unable to read the script. So I bought some fizzy water. A plastic bottle was the only option available in the shop.  I write this not to shame WBM for his pretty innocuous comment, but because it struck me as a perfect example of how many assumptions we make on a daily basis. In this instance, it was fairly harmless (I put the bottle in the recycling and have reverted to my reusable flask so I truly hope I didnât kill too many turtles). But in other examples, assumption can have a terrible impact.  Prejudice stems from assumption. A racist will assume a black man driving a nice car must be a thief. A sexist will assume a woman in a boardroom must be the secretary. These assumptions are toxic and dangerous. They come from a place of limited knowledge, where the reflex is to think the worst without examining the context of our own thinking or the context of the other personâs actions.  The migraine passed, by the way, although whether it was because of the sparkling water or not, I canât possibly assume to know.

Paper set: Lou Blackshaw  You donât have to be into gardening (or be great friends with someone who is) in order to appreciate the products on these pages, but it could definitely help. Because the inspiration for this selection is to provide some TLC to the pruners, planters and weeders among us; the ones who stoop, kneel, crouch and tend to get their hands dirty or simply those who are involved in some form of heavy-duty manual labour.  Equally, of course, they can work for anyone who is feeling some aches and pains, is in need of a reboot, or simply wants to give their very-washed hands some much-needed extra nourishment.  My initial inspiration came from the In The Garden range by that always charming brand Heathcote & Ivory. The whole collection comes with a delicate scent of rhubarb, with a dash of lilac blossom. And the packaging is decorated with garden-inspired illustrations by Clare Therese Gray, a young British artist. More than that, much of it has an eco-conscience. So the Barrier Cream (Â£7, heathcote-ivory.com), a rich shea butter formula with thyme essential oil, comes in a pot that can be repurposed for planting cuttings and seeds. The All Purpose Balm (Â£8), with lavender, sage and rosemary essential oils, is housed in a pretty tin with illustrations embossed on the lid and can be turned into a useful little storage container (or what my brother would call hoarderâs delight).  The Muscle Soak Bath Salts (Â£5) contain eucalyptus, rosemary and lavender essential oils to add a delicious scent to a good old wallow in the tub, and their paper wrapping is a pretty addition to any bathroom shelf.  As if that werenât enough of a garden theme, Heathcote & Ivory has also produced its annual collection in partnership with the Royal Horticultural Society, using botanical extracts of wisteria, lilac and lavender essential oils plus packaging designs inspired by botanical drawings from the RHSâs Lindley Library. Itâs a lovely offering full of washes and lotions but Iâm a sucker for the RHS Flower Blooms Lavender Garden Scented Soap Bar (Â£6).  For an alternative bathing option, go to Batch #001 and grab some of its truly fantastic Salt & Oil Bath Soak with organic sweet orange and bergamot (Â£22, batch001.com). You wonât find anything finer than this in even the most luxurious of spas: the mix of pink Himalayan and Dead Sea salts smells glorious and will instantly transport you to relaxation land, help you unwind and soothe dry skin. Plus the understated brown glass bottles and labels all feel super-chic while full of apothecary-style goodness.  If youâre a shower person worry not, for Iâve got you covered. Or perhaps more accurately Aromatherapy Associates has. Already famed for its wellness oils that can be used in both the bath and shower, it has now launched specific Shower Oils (Â£26, aromatherapyassociates.com) in all of its signature aromas: De-Stress Calm & Focus, Revive Energise & Awaken, Rose Enrich & Uplift, and Muscle Ease & Recover.  These are seriously superior body cleansers: they feel rich as you apply them and once they meet water they create a very delicate lather. And the powerful aromas of the essential oils are like mood therapy â Muscle Ease & Recover includes rosemary, ginger and black pepper to warm and ease muscle tension. These come in recyclable plastic bottles and use 50 per cent post-consumer recycled plastic.  For extra muscle aid, look to Greek brand Kearâs lovely Calm Revive Arnica Body Oil (Â£39, kearlife.com). This comes with arnica blended with sweet almond oil, extra virgin olive oil and beeswax â just rub it in to ease any tired muscles as well as to moisturise.  Finally, Crabtree & Evelyn The Gardeners Ground Exfoliation Powder (Â£28.50, crabtree-evelyn.co.uk) is an all-over body scrub but also great for an extra-thorough hand wash. Itâs made from coffee powder and finely ground raspberry seeds â simply add some to your favourite body cleanser and it will do the rest to slough away dead skin and/or dirt.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-8541147/Gardeners-youll-really-dig-these.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,17b527e999511b420158cde70f4238d0329b509503c7aec7ece689866419084d,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

But for choir conductor Karen Gibson her happiest achievement is the pride of her mother Nathalie  Karen and Nathalie at the Queenâs Garden Party in 2018  KARENâS STORY  Choir conductor and workshop leader Karen Gibson, 56, lives in Southwest London  Standing in St Georgeâs Chapel on that May morning two years ago, I knew the eyes of the world were on me. In front of me stood my choir, behind me the newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex. As I waited for the first bars of music to play, with the chapel quiet, it was my mum my thoughts turned to.  I could picture her so clearly in my mind, at home in Southwest London, chair pulled up close to the TV, absorbing every second of this amazing moment in my life.  Mum arrived in the UK from Guyana in 1962 â she was part of the Windrush generation who came after the Second World War. I was born the following year and my sister Kim is a year younger than me.  Our father, who was also Guyanese, left the family when we were little. Mum rose to the challenge of being a single mother with a determination which, when I reflect on it now, blows me away. Mum worked three jobs to support us. Her generation of women possessed a resilience and courage you donât often find now. I look back and wonder how she managed to work so hard, run a home and be such a strong maternal figure to us. When she wasnât working, or sleeping in between shifts, she was in the kitchen cooking hot curries, or we were all at church, scrubbed clean, in our good âchurch clothesâ that werenât allowed to be worn any other day of the week.  Mum lived with racism every day; it was just part of the fabric of life for her. Sometimes it was obvious hostility, often it was insidious. But it was always there. She didnât shield that truth from me and my sister. She knew she had to prepare us, as black women, for the world we too would have to face. Time and time again as I grew up, Mum would tell me that as a black woman I had to work harder, achieve more, be better â because the colour of my skin meant the cards were stacked against me. While I didnât experience the same open hostilities she had, because society had changed, I knew I had to overcompensate.  Mum didnât want me to have a career in music; she wanted me to become a lawyer and Kim a doctor. âGet your piece of paper,â she would say firmly, because homework always had to come first. Yet, ironically, it was Mum who first fostered my passion for music and performing. When I was ten, she sent me and Kim to piano lessons â she says it was to keep us out of trouble! We were both classically trained but church was where I fell in love with singing. My teenage years were spent travelling up and down the country to perform at gospel concerts, as well as forming a group called New Dawn with Kim and some friends.  I forged a career leading gospel music workshops in churches, schools and communities in the UK and across Europe. In 1994 I founded The Kingdom Choir. We went on to sing for Nelson Mandela and the Queen and perform with Elton John and the Spice Girls. In 2010, when I led a choir of young black schoolgirls to victory in a national televised competition, Mum finally understood why it was my vocation and, for the first time, told me how proud she was of me.  Iâd always craved more affirmation from Mum, for her to articulate the pride I knew she felt inside, but it didnât come easily to her. Life has dealt her many hard knocks which makes her struggle to express her emotions. However, I think that seeing those girls from a tough part of London celebrate their win against the odds, and seeing what my skills could achieve, resonated deeply with her. She phoned me the morning after we won and said proudly, âGod has given you a gift, Karen.â Then, in her own inimitable style, said: âAnd donât muck it up!â  I was on a bus in March 2018 when someone from Prince Charlesâs office called to invite The Kingdom Choir to sing at the royal wedding.  I thought it was a joke at first; I couldnât believe it. Leading the choir that day, I didnât feel nervous, just happy and honoured to deliver this beautiful gift of music to Harry, Meghan and the world. And I knew that, in her own way, there would be nobody prouder than Mum.  All my life she has supported and pushed me to make the very best of myself. Watching me that day I hoped she felt she was reaping the rewards of all her hard work.  Karen and Nathalie with sister Kim (right) in 1970  NATHALIEâS STORY  Nathalie Gibson, 82, lives in Southwest London  Not long after I arrived in the UK, I looked for a church to worship in. I wanted the familiarity of going to a service and to pray for help and guidance as I started my new life. After a few weeks of attending a local Anglican church, the vicar said, âThanks for coming, but the other members donât like it. Please donât come back.â  I felt so rejected, especially as it happened in a place where I should have found refuge and acceptance. Every day I sent Karen and Kim off to school and went to one of my three jobs, in nursing and as a telephonist, and would experience racism. People rubbed my skin, to see if the colour came off, and touched my hair; white colleagues were promoted over black ones even if they were less qualified, and I saw signs on doors that read âNo blacksâ.  I learned to keep my mouth shut and my head down, hoping things would change by the time my girls went out into the world. I was brought up in Guyana by my mother and my aunt, I was an only child and my father died when I was 16. My mother didnât know she was pregnant and delivered me prematurely. I was so tiny the doctor told her to put me in a corner and let me die. My aunt scooped me up and, along with my mum, raised me. They taught me how to be a strong woman, like them.  Leaving Guyana when I was 25 was a very difficult decision because I already had three children there, two sons and a daughter â Karenâs elder half-siblings. Their father had left me for another woman and I decided to entrust my children to their grandmother and great-aunt, and move away. I didnât want my family to just âget byâ. I wanted a good life and I worked very hard to provide that for Karen and Kim, as well as sending money home for my children in Guyana, who I visited regularly.  It was important to me that Karen and Kim were well-dressed, studied hard and had luxuries like music lessons. I knew the world would judge them because of their colour and I wanted to give them the confidence and skills to rise above that and succeed.  As Karen became more involved in the musical world it worried me. I didnât believe there was money or security in music. I thought it was a waste of her intelligence and the education Iâd worked so hard to give her. Of course, she proved me wrong â what she has achieved is incredible. I love to hear Karen sing â she sings with her whole body and her heart and has inspired so many people with her voice and her energy.  Iâve spent a lifetime holding back my emotions. My life hasnât been easy and I am afraid of being too happy in case everything goes wrong. But I am so proud of Karen and Kim, who is also a choir conductor. I watched Karen perform at the royal wedding alone at home. I wanted to soak up the moment privately. I cried tears of joy and gave thanks to God for this wonderful, talented daughter of mine.

Zelda reads all your letters but regrets that she cannot answer them all personally  I love my mumâ¦ but I donât like her  I am an only child and my father died aged 36 from cancer; I was only ten. My childhood was awful after that. My mother started drinking heavily, initially through grief, but she never stopped. She would tell me on numerous occasions that she didnât want children and that I was only here because my father had wanted them. She also assaulted me many times when she was drunk, once ripping an earring out as she slapped me across the face with keys in her hand. She is now 82, living alone, and is in poor health. Unfortunately, I also have health problems, which forced me to give up work three years ago. I live with chronic pain due to fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis and pancreatitis; my husband is my full-time carer. Because of my health I cannot travel, so I havenât seen my mum for a year, even though she was recently admitted to hospital following a fall. I donât like her but because she is my mum I love her and I have invited her countless times to move in with us. I donât really want her to but I feel that it is my duty. She has always refused this offer so I eventually stopped asking her. However a couple of weeks ago I received emails from other relatives telling me that I must arrange social services care for my mother. This interference has made me see red. I can barely look after myself without having the added stress of trying to sort out my mum. What should I do?  Your mother has let you down very badly. She has been abusive and totally neglectful. To tell you that she never wanted children is an awful thing to say. You say that you donât like her but that you love her because she is your mum. However, I would suggest that perhaps you should question this love for her, as she has not been loving towards you at all. I wonder if you feel that you love her because you so desperately wanted to. You needed a mother, so in your mind you have created an image of one who loves you and convinced yourself you love her back. Of course, it must have been dreadful for her to lose her husband, but you also lost your dad and she should have put you first and looked after you. So I urge you to give up all thoughts of having her to live with you. There is absolutely no obligation for you to do this; it would be far too much for you. You need to put your own health first. I also think it would put a huge strain on your marriage and neither you nor your husband need this. This might sound harsh but it isnât, so tell your relatives that you are not well enough to arrange care for your mum and ask if they could take over. They could contact Age UK (0800 678 1602, ageuk.org.uk) as a starting point. You may feel a lot of grief when she dies because of the love you should have had but didnât. In the meantime you may want to have some counselling to start healing the pain of the past. Ask your GP for a referral or try Relate (relate.org.uk).  Heâs selfish and lazy, so why canât I leave him?  I am 45 and married with three children, aged 17, 14 and nine. I have fallen out of love with my husband. We both work, but the running of the household and childcare falls to me. When I ask for support he says Iâm just being a martyr. He is irresponsible with money and spends any he has on himself with no thought for what our children might need. He will go into the kitchen to prepare himself some food but will not ask if anyone else wants something. Once I fell and fractured my wrist but when I called him from the hospital the first thing he said was, âWho is going to pick up the kids and cook tea?â There is no physical relationship any more. I donât know if I can leave him as I donât see âIâm just a bit miserableâ as a reason and I have no financial means to go elsewhere.  You say that being âjust a bit miserableâ doesnât seem like a good enough reason to leave, but your husbandâs selfishness, his irresponsibility, his thoughtlessness and the fact that you have fallen totally out of love with him and have no sexual relationship are reasons aplenty. Sometimes if someone tells their partner that the marriage is over and they want to leave, the shock can be enough to make them realise they need to change. But sadly I donât see much hope for this here. Your husbandâs reaction when you broke your wrist was appalling and says it all. It wonât be easy, but I think you need out. So contact Gingerbread (gingerbread.org.uk), the charity that supports single parents, and Citizens Advice (citizensadvice.org.uk) to make a plan for leaving and find out about benefits you could be entitled to, plus how to negotiate separating, childcare arrangements and where you will all live. Hopefully he would be forced to hand over more of his income to help support your children.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/you/article-8540871/ASK-ZELDA-relationships-expert-Zelda-West-Meads-answers-questions.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,0b9d9cf5f3a910c5d266a9f0f9284f6a5d34edcb4b63f3efc26d768c7a5a801e,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

(I have, as it happens, quite a long list of big books I always said Iâd read but never have. Do get in touch if youâd like recommendations.) Itâs a multi-family and political epic set in India just after Partition (as I now know), and I was as much anticipating it as anyone, because itâs always interesting to see what theyâve done with the big book you havenât read. And my conclusion? As this is, for the most part, bland and stilted and timid and clumsy and rather ordinary, I just donât think itâs as good as the book I havenât read. At. All.  Tanya Maniktala and Mahira Kakkar in A Suitable Boy. It looks like weâre set for a star-crossed-lovers-type scenario, which is something I canât get especially excited about. (Sad but true)  Adapted by Andrew Davies (Pride And Prejudice, War And Peace and that which we swore weâd never speak of again but it was a lie... Sanditon!), and directed by Mira Nair, the first disappointment was apparent from the off, when it became clear that the production had mistakenly, in my opinion, opted for an almost Peter Sellers approach to language. The cast is all Indian, but instead of speaking Urdu or Hindi to each other, they speak heavily accented English and, even leaving aside all else, like respecting a nationâs mother tongue, the fact is, well, they wouldnât. So this lack of naturalism undermined believability throughout. And itâs also what I mean by timid. Whatâs wrong with subtitles? Because some would find that off-putting? Was that the basis for the decision? Well, it never put us off all those Scandi-noirs, is all Iâll say.  On to the meat of it, which centres on a widowed mother, Rupa (Mahira Kakkar), seeking a husband for her young university student daughter Lata (Tanya Maniktala). The first episode of six opened on the wedding day of Lataâs older sister with Rupa summoning Lata from the garden: âCome inside at once... you have to get dressed for your sisterâs wedding.â Like Lata wouldnât know itâs her sisterâs wedding? True, a first episode has much setting up to do and you must expect some exposition but, still, the script was so heavy-handed in this regard it had me shouting, âBut theyâd already know that!â on numerous occasions. âYou are the Revenue Minister and I am the Home Minister,â says the Revenue Minister. Yes, but you both already know that! âHoli is a Hindu holiday for the Hindu nation,â says one character later on. Yes, but everyone would already know that! God, what a trudge.  But back to the narrative. Against a backdrop of political unrest and, in particular, a new Hindu temple being built right up against a mosque, which leads to protests and the police opening fire, we witness Lata falling for Kabir (Danesh Razvi), who is a dish, but a most unsuitable boy, as sheâs Hindu and heâs Muslim. So it looks like weâre set for a star-crossed-lovers-type scenario, which is something I canât get especially excited about. (Sad but true.)  As for other characters, thereâs Maan (Ishaan Khatter), the young son of the family Lataâs sister has married into, who is feckless and irresponsible and meant to be charming in that way, but actually came across as puerile. When he pushed that Home Minister into the fountain I just thought, âWhatâs wrong with you, boy?â This is beautiful to look at, with a cast that may even be unfeasibly beautiful, but it was wholly stilted and inert and dragged until, perhaps, the last 15 minutes, which brought an unfaithful wife into play â I found I did want to learn more about her â as well as a fat, drunk, repellent Raja (that perked things up) and his courtesan Saeeda (the Bollywood star Tabu), with whom Maan becomes smitten. So maybe this does have legs. I think our best bet is to reconvene next week after episode two to see how we feel, but in the meantime and as it stands: not as good as the book I havenât read.  Michael Sheen and Tom Payne in Prodigal Son. As this doesnât take itself seriously, itâs hard to know why we should, and the result is plain hammy  The other show I was keenly anticipating was Prodigal Son, a drama about a criminal psychologist (Tom Payne) whose father is âThe Surgeonâ, a serial killer responsible for 23 grisly deaths and is now in prison, but whom the son is forced to consult when it appears a copycat killer is on the loose.  The father is played by Michael Sheen, and I was looking forward to Sheen going full-on Hannibal Lecter but, alas, his character is pretty much sidelined for an absurd police procedural involving Bond-style villains and the worldâs most unlikely prison cell â huge, lined with books, with TV and phone, how does that work? â and jokes that very much donât land.  As this doesnât take itself seriously, itâs hard to know why we should, and the result is plain hammy. In fact, as ham these days is 82 per cent injected water, this may even be more hammy than actual ham. Yes, Iâm pretty sure it is.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-8575863/DEBORAH-ROSS-Goodness-gracious-Peter-Sellers-accents.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,5fd234d89c9d5019f85bfcb4b5cf771c52d6732f13ee90f1894bde7ce45b8620,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

2020-08-06 13:18:20.168280,"Sat, 01 Aug 2020 21:01:41 GMT",Memorial Drive review: Natasha Trethewey has crafted an indelible memorial to her mother,"Memorial Drive: A Daughter's Memoir  Natasha Trethewey Bloomsbury Â£16.99  Rating:  In 1985, when Natasha Trethewey was 19, her former stepfather shot and killed her mother at point-blank range at their home in Atlanta. Afterwards, Trethewey locked the door on her past, going on to become a two-time poet laureate of the United States.  But even as she thought she was fleeing the trauma, she was in fact working her way steadily back to it. Decades later, returning to Atlanta for a university teaching post, sheâs compelled to confront her willed amnesia.  This powerful memoir is the result. A journey through searing personal grief, its scope is broadened by sharp insights into domestic abuse and racism, and through a keen exploration of the transformative power of storytelling.  A journey through searing personal grief (A young Natasha with her father, the poet Eric Trethewey, and her mother, social worker Gwendolyn, above)  Gwendolyn Ann Turnbough was raised in Americaâs segregated South by a fierce, smart single mother who refused to be cowed when Klan members burned a cross in her driveway.  She was ringed by extended family, and when she married Eric Trethewey, a fellow student who just happened to be white (interracial marriage was illegal in Mississippi until 1967), those same aunts and uncles doted equally on light-skinned Trethewey, the baby that followed.  After Gwenâs marriage broke down, she moved with her daughter to Atlanta. Trethewey was seven when Joel Grimmette, a controlling, violent Vietnam veteran entered their life.  He soon began tormenting her. Heâd invade her private space, breaking the lock on her diary and leaving her hairbrush flecked with his dandruff. Left alone with him, heâd sadistically tell her he was going to have her committed, forcing her to pack a bag and driving her in long loops round the bypass that rings Atlanta before finally taking her home.  IT'S A FACT Trethewey won the 2007 Pulitzer Prize in Poetry for her 2006 collection Native Guard, which was inspired by and dedicated to her late mother. Advertisement  Trethewey remains mystified by her failure to tell her mother. Was it just that she liked to think of herself as a âgood girlâ, and didnât want to spoil her motherâs apparent newfound happiness?  Itâs one of several sources of gnawing guilt, too: if she hadnât stayed silent, perhaps her mother would have left the marriage soon enough to save herself. But later, when Trethewey hears Joel beating Gwen and tells a beloved teacher, sheâs fobbed off.  Itâs the first of many occasions when figures of authority let Trethewey and her mother down, culminating in the cop whose job it was to watch Gwenâs apartment after Joel was freed from jail following his first attempt at murdering her.  On the morning he succeeded, the cop had knocked off early.  While Memorial Drive is not a long book, Trethewey finds space to weave in dreams, myths and talismanic images along with police transcripts, spinning an account that is as full of omens as a Greek tragedy, and setting it to a soundtrack of her motherâs favourite albums by The Temptations, Al Green, Jimi Hendrix.  This is spare, spellbinding storytelling, and even though institutional indifference helps make its tragic denouement inevitable, itâs as gripping as any thriller.  âTo survive trauma, one must be able to tell a story about it,â Trethewey writes.  In the process of not only surviving but also thriving, sheâs crafted an indelible memorial to her mother, sentence by crystalline sentence.  The Sirens Of Mars  Sarah Stewart Johnson Allen Lane Â£20  Rating:  This summer, Earth and Mars are in their best positions for travel between the two and there are missions planned by the US, China and the United Arab Emirates. Itâs an apt time, then, for planetary scientist Sarah Stewart Johnson to explore our fascination with the red planet, which, thanks to similarities with Earth, has long been a focal point in the search for extraterrestrial life.  Johnson charts the Mars missions that have taken place and the extraordinary characters behind them. Take adventurer Steve Fossett. While testing space equipment in his hot-air balloon in 1998 he was blasted out of the sky by a thunderstorm and plunged 29,000ft into shark-infested waters off the Australian coast. (He was eventually rescued.)  Alongside tales of derring-do are existential concerns. Johnson is preoccupied with âhow we live out our small, shining moments as human beings on this planet, hurtling through our enormous universeâ.  Sarah Stewart Johnson charts the Mars missions that have taken place and the extraordinary characters behind them like adventurer Steve Fossett  She pinpoints the mind-bending difference in scale between the lives of space scientists and the vastness of the realm they are exploring. While she watches the Nasa rover Curiosity touchdown on Mars just hours after giving birth to her first child â improbably, both events take place on the same day â she reflects that âthe whole landing was only seven minutes, about the same time it took the obstetrician to tug my son from the wombâ.  Johnsonâs enthusiasm is infectious and she writes with bewitching lyricism, particularly on what space exploration means to her: the âshimmering hope that life might not be an ephemeral thing, even if we areâ.

Release dates for big blockbusters such as Tenet and Mulan seem to have slipped by the week, although the latest news is that Tenet will be out on August 26.  By comparison, Unhinged â its release finely tuned to coincide with the reopening of most English cinemas this weekend â was a constant and reassuring presence. Not least because it had a proper star, Russell Crowe, in it. How bad could it be?  I began finding out as the red curtains swished back at what was my first visit to the cinema for over four months. Gradually, all my pent-up excitement, all the thrill of being back in the game, slipped slowly and miserably away.  Unhinged was a constant and reassuring presence. Not least because it had a proper star, Russell Crowe (above), in it. How bad could it be?  Not only is Unhinged just plain not very good, itâs also the wrong film at the wrong time, cynically released by distributors clearly hoping that the combination of Croweâs name and our desperate desire to see something new will bring the paying customers running.  Well, save your money.  Unhinged is essentially the 1971 TV movie Duel, but without the style that made its director Steven Spielberg famous and without the menace and unexplained mystery that still makes it compelling viewing today.  Unhinged replaces both with a super-sized Crowe and a steadily mounting body count.  A recently separated and stressed mother is late driving her already anxious son to school. So when she gets stuck behind a pick-up truck at traffic lights that have just turned green, she doesnât spare the horn. Big mistake.  For what she doesnât know is that the driver of the pick-up (Crowe) has just murdered what we assume was his ex-wife and new partner and is in no mood to be honked at. And when she doesnât apologise, Rachel (a poor Caren Pistorius) is in real trouble.  As are her son, divorce lawyer and just about anyone in her phone contacts...  I think you can see where weâre heading for the next very nasty 90 minutes, in a film conspicuous for its complete inability to say anything interesting about mounting anger levels in the modern age.

In episode three there is a sense of mounting dread as the story of what happened in a minaret in Fallujah unfolds like a horror film. The message â war is hell and this conflict was pointless â is hardly new, but rarely has it been delivered with such force.

All 4, available now  The Confessions Of Thomas Quick  In the 1990s, Sweden was chilled to the marrow by reports of the countryâs first serial killer. Psychopathic loner Sture Bergwall, also known as Thomas Quick, confessed to 30 brutal murders â involving rape and cannibalism â and was convicted of eight of them. The fact that some of the details coincided with existing unsolved murder cases helped to convict him. That and his profile: a history of drug addiction and molestation of young boys.  But was his statement, obtained while he was undergoing psychiatric treatment in a mental institution after stabbing a man heâd met in a bar, all that he said it was, or had he made it all up because he was lonely? In this 2015 documentary, Quick himself is interviewed about his case. Is the soft-spoken, articulate, white-bearded old man telling the truth this time? Or is he the ultimate unreliable narrator? All 4, available now  Heroes  This sci-fi drama was a huge hit when it first arrived on British screens in 2014 and eventually ran to four series. Itâs about a disparate group of otherwise ordinary people who realise that they have superpowers. Among them are cheerleader Claire Bennet (Hayden Panettiere), who can rapidly heal from any injury and so is indestructible; geeky Japanese computer programmer Hiro (Masi Oka), who can manipulate time; and Isaac (Santiago Cabrera), a drug-addict artist who can see â and paint â the future.  But why is this happening now, and how are these reluctant âsuperheroesâ linked?

They are effectively owned by Vought International, a powerful corporation that hires them out to cities willing to cough up the necessary. Billy Butcher (Karl Urban, perpetrating the worst cockney accent since Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins) is the leader of the titular vigilante group and has personal reasons for wanting to bring down The Seven.

'If you die, Piers, you die'","Monday, July 13  Iâve decamped to St Tropez for the summer to recharge after the extraordinary frenzy of the first six months of 2020 (has it really only been HALF A YEAR?).  A Times columnist joked recently that I must be âgetting very fatâ with all the Ministers that I was âhaving for breakfastâ on Good Morning Britain.  In fact, I was piling on a few extra pounds, but that was more due to lockdown comfort-eating and exhausted workout-avoidance.  Joan was absolutely seething for many weeks at my impertinent solicitousness for her welfare. But timeâs a great healer, and we were reunited for a socially-distanced lunch today at our mutual favourite restaurant, Club 55 on Pampelonne beach  So, my holiday game-plan was clear: exercise, swim, eat healthily, get fit, shed weight.  This lasted precisely 26 hours, until I left a restaurant tonight and badly turned my ankle over in a grass divot.  Weâd power-walked a mile there from our villa â the start of my new regime! â and there were no cabs available.  As I pondered my options, I remembered a war story from SAS: Who Dares Wins star Ant Middleton: âOn a 60-mile trek with a 200kg Bergen on my back, I felt my ankle break. Some might have given up. I broke the other ankle to even up the pain and carried on.â  I didnât do that â but I did grit my teeth and yomp angrily and silently home, uphill and in sandals, each agonising step causing me to yelp and almost certainly making things worse.  Friday, July 17  Dame Joan Collins has been enraged about the way older people have been treated during the coronavirus crisis.  âIâve always thought Western society was terribly ageist,â she told The Spectator, âthen our Government insisted the âover-70sâ (horrible expression) were part of the âvulnerablesâ (an even more horrible expression) and should remain in lockdown (the most horrible expression of all) until a vaccine is found. That was utter discrimination against the hardy individuals who have no health issues. But more harmful was bolstering the existing belief among the general public (and prospective employers) that the old should keep out of everyoneâs way.â  I was singled out for particular fury after cancelling a meal with Joan and her husband Percy in March.  âJust before lockdown we were planning to have dinner with Piers Morgan,â she said, âand when I texted him to check if it was still on, I received a manifesto explaining that he âdidnât want to be responsibleâ for my untimely death!â  Joan was absolutely seething for many weeks afterwards at my impertinent solicitousness for her welfare.  But timeâs a great healer, and we were reunited for a socially-distanced lunch today at our mutual favourite restaurant, Club 55 on Pampelonne beach (above).  âIâve considered all the coronavirus health risks for vulnerable people, and concluded that if you die Piers, you die,â Joan chuckled derisively.  We both agreed that one good thing about the pandemic is no longer having to touch anyone. âIâve been a germaphobe for years,â Joan said, âMy worst horror is complete strangers bear-hugging me, then moving in for the sloppy kiss. Now theyâre not allowed to because itâs illegal!â  We discussed the unbelievably lurid Johnny Depp libel case against The Sun, which has seen gruesome mud-slinging between him and his ex-wife Amber Heard.  Joan revealed that the last time she saw Depp was when they too had lunch together at Club 55 a few years ago.  âWhat I remember most is how incredibly patient and charming he was to all the kids who kept coming up for autographs and photos. He was at the height of his Pirates Of The Caribbean fame so they all loved him, and he couldnât have been more courteous. He also kept calling me âMaâamâ, which I liked too.â  Iâve heard similar positive stories about him â but judging by some of the appalling stuff coming out in court, Deppâs clearly a Jekyll-and-Hyde character with his nastier Hyde side emerging when heâs off his head on drugs.  Next year will be Joanâs 70th in the movie business (her first film was Lady Godiva Rides Again in 1951, in which she played a beauty contestant) â an absolutely staggering milestone that makes her Britainâs longest-reigning star.  But as we discussed throwing a gigantic party to celebrate, an extremely fit-looking young blonde lady suddenly bounded up to the table.  âMr Morgan!â she announced with a beaming grin, âI am Val Kahl â your biggest fan! I love how you speak your mind! I am a TV host like you and a Yin Vinyasa power yoga sculptor. I want to bend you into shapes you never knew you had! I promise you a great time!â  Her positive energy crackled almost as palpably as the negative tension around some of my lunch partners.  âSadly, my HUSBAND has hurt his ankle so wonât be able to do any power yoga sculpting,â said Celia.  âWait, this could be just the therapy I need!â I insisted.  Val beamed delightedly. âIt would make me SO happy to get you into one of my sessions!â  âCalm down, dear,â sighed Dame Joan.  âI am a big fan of yours too, Joanna!â Val bellowed, unhelpfully.  Later in the meal, brilliant photos emerged (via Twitter) of the great Captain Tom Moore, 100, receiving his knighthood from the Queen, 94.  Like Dame Joan, 87, their indomitable spirit is key to their longevity.  âIf you lot had your way, weâd all be kept hidden away in dungeons until a vaccine arrives!â said Joan, âwhen weâve got more energy and good health than people half our age. Look at the state of you, you can barely even walk!â  Sunday, July 19  Iâm now on crutches for my increasingly troublesome ankle injury, with French doctors suspecting a tendon tear. âHow did you do that with your lack of pace?â texted Gary Lineker.  My sons were even less sympathetic: âAs you would say to us, Father,â said Stanley, âstop moaning and MAN UP!â  Their sentiments were shared by Celia, who, when I spent ten minutes struggling to get in to bed tonight, grimaced and said: âThis is a frightening glimpse into the future of our marriageâ¦ and so not what I signed up for.â",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-8575857/Ive-considered-risks-Joan-chuckled-die-Piers-die.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,43a0e8fe4dea907eb09c7d7ec59f3ef941de17f0ef96d35f96a031e504f2e48a,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:18:24.857252,"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 21:31:16 GMT",Here comes the sunflower! It's time for late-summer annuals,"Monty revisits one of his classic books, Gardening at Longmeadow, in an occasional series.  As summer moves into its second half I rely on the half-hardy and tender annuals to provide colour and form. The most dramatic of all late- season annuals â and one of my favourites â is the sunflower.  The knee-jerk response to sunflowers is the childâs drawing of huge plants topped with flowers as big as dinner plates radiating petals like the sun. These are fun to grow, especially for children, and I love them.  âRussian Giantâ is an old favourite, guaranteed to grow exceptionally tall, but stake it early and well otherwise it will inevitably crash to the ground. Often this will not damage the plants, but they very quickly turn to find the sun and start growing with a crick in their neck so that when you right them again they are permanently bent.  Monty Don shared his advice for growing sunflowers, as he reveals the best varieties for adding a luxurious richness to borders. Pictured: A glorious display of sunflowers  When it comes to selecting the colours of sunflowers I find that the velvety rusts, plum, burnt orange and browns that you find in varieties like Helianthus annuus âPrado Redâ and âVelvet Queenâ add a luxurious richness to a border that exceeds any other plant in late summer.  âVelvet Queenâ remains my favourite, but then she was the first that I ever grew. Each flower is not huge but the size of a good saucer and comes in colours ranging from deep crimson through a burnt orange to brown with golden points of pollen dotted about the centre.  âClaretâ and âPrado Redâ are both remarkably similar, with a plum undertone to their light-sapping colour. In the shade they are darker and can seem to be almost brown.  The âPradoâ series has masses of flowers and is practically pollen-free, which means that you do not get the staining if you brush against it.  All these dark sunflowers have long been essential components of the Longmeadow Jewel Garden borders and work well with the late-summer palette of crocosmias â especially the orange âEmily Mackenzieâ â as well as the large range of marmalade and plum-coloured heleniums, red dahlias, bright orange tithonias and humble calendulas.  At the other end of the spectrum, I like the pale varieties such as âVanilla Iceâ or âMoonwalkerâ, as well as the perennial sunflower âLemon Queenâ with its mass of delicate miniature sunflowers.  Monty (pictured) explained that he stops dead-heading sunflowers from the middle of September because he wants the birds to have something to eat  Sunflowers respond to dead-heading (removing the spent blooms) by providing waves of smaller flowers.  âVelvet Queenâ is naturally multi-headed, like a great set of candlesticks two metres tall, but others that instinctively produce one dominant huge flower will produce extra shoots at the junction of leaf and stem if you keep cutting off the flowerheads.  I stop dead-heading from the middle of September so that the birds have something to eat.  The finches love them, clinging to their centres and greedily pulling out the seeds from their individual compartments as they store up body fat for winter, and I have seen a crow trying to copy this, balancing with all the grace of a drunkard walking a tightrope.  Your kitchen garden: Blackcurrants  Monty said blackcurrants grow best in rich soil and needs lots of sunshine for fruit to ripen  The blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum) was introduced in the 17th century, but for 200 years it was restricted to being medicinal. Few plants have more vitamin C, and in the Second World War young children were issued a ration of blackcurrant juice.  They do best in moisture retentive (not waterlogged), rich soil and need a thick mulch of manure or compost every spring. They need lots of sunshine for new wood and fruit to ripen.  However, they crop best with exposure to cold weather in winter. Unlike red or white currants which fruit on spurs taking a few years to develop, blackcurrants produce fruit from the stem.  In the first year they produce some fruit, lots in the second year and the crop falls off after that.  So prune by cutting the oldest stems down to the ground straight after harvest. They take easily from hardwood cuttings, keeping any buds, put in the ground in autumn and transplanted after a year.  âBen Sarekâ is good for a pot or small space but you get a bigger harvest from âBen Lomondâ, âBen Moreâ or âBoskoop Giantâ. Birds love them and they must be netted as soon as the berries ripen to the last picking. A fruit cage is worth it if you have many bushes.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/gardening/article-8569581/Here-comes-sunflower-time-late-summer-annuals.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,e9022007c042bcb708dc592a3e2fa9e7c7be8e2e73da7d16f0afed44a70380ec,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.â This dark, disturbing documentary about Jeffrey Epstein is still high in the streaming charts following the arrest of his right-hand woman Ghislaine Maxwell (both above) Epsteinâs victims, several of whom are interviewed at length here, can attest to his interest in young girls. Some were only 14 when first raped by him. Over four episodes, the series looks at the murky origins of the billionaireâs fortune, the way in which he built what one lawyer describes as a âmolestation pyramid schemeâ by recruiting kids for sex, and then paying them to bring their friends to him, and his eventual downfall. Itâs not an easy watch. Victims tell of his devastating impact on their lives and of the battle to have their stories taken seriously. Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew, is among the contributors. For a long time, Epstein was mysteriously untouchable and had the power to make inconvenient investigations go away. He committed suicide in prison last year, giving conspiracy theorists a field day, while Ghislaine Maxwell, of whom we hear a great deal, is awaiting trial. Some Netflix documentaries really wring their subject dry. This one feels as though itâs barely scratched the surface.

If they are considering moving to a different town, how can they distinguish between those town centres that will bounce back when the pandemic has passed, and those which will be commercial black spots?  Several experts believe the answer may lie in our street markets.  'The wheel has turned full circle,' says Joe Harrison, chief executive of the National Market Traders Federation (NMTF). 'Now the big stores are closing, it will be up to the markets to help people through the coming recession.' Mr Harrison says that markets have both a community and social value.  Roll up: The busy Hexham Farmersâ Market in Northumberland, which runs twice a month  Visit any thriving market and you will find Del Boy replicas building up bonds of friendship with their customers. Research shows they also bring in trade to shops nearby, known as the 'multiplier effect'.  In leafy Winchester, the different markets have boosted house sales. 'The city has everything from its farmers' market, which featured in Rick Stein's TV show, to the Christmas extravaganza in Cathedral Close,' says Patrick Â­Â­Glynn-Jones, of Strutt & Parker estate agents (struttandparker.com). 'They are always a topic of conversation when people look to live in Winchester.'  Mr Glynn-Jones says that the street markets are particularly popular at present, as High Street shopping is proving so stressful.  'Shopping in a market beats going into stores, which involves queuing and worrying about wearing gloves and masks,' he says.  Winchester's desirability is reflected in its house prices, which over the past year are 2 per cent up on the previous 12 months.  The average price of a terrace house is Â£521,000, and for a detached home Â£807,000. In Kings Worthy, a village to the north-east of the city, you will find a two-bedroom terrace home for about Â£300,000.  A good street market is a shop window for the community, reflecting the passions of its residents.  So when primary school teacher Shelagh Muchmore visited the charming market in the Union Street car park in Deal, Kent, last January, it sealed her ambition to buy a home there.  'It was such a lovely, eclectic mix of stalls,' says Shelagh, 58, who has since bought a cottage in the seaside town for about Â£300,000, with a view to retiring there.  'There was an artisan wine producer next to a baker, while a flower stall was next to one dealing in antiques, next to another selling fruit. It was so quirky, just like Deal itself.' Shelagh also fell for Deal's off-beat mix of architectural styles: Victorian cottages are found just around the corner from Georgian seafront villas.  Silver House on Silver Street, an imposing, Â­Georgian, four-Â­bedroom townhouse in a Conservation Area close to the beach, is priced at Â£825,000 with Bright & Bright (brightand bright.co.uk).  We spend 32 per cent less when buying fresh produce at a market rather than in local shops, according to a survey carried out by NMTF in 2008. Farmers' markets also compete more on quality.  At Hexham Farmers' Market, Northumberland, producers come from within a 50-mile radius of the town. Everything, down to that the last jar of chutney or jam, contains vegetables and fruit that are locally grown. The twice-monthly market, which is held next to Hexham Abbey, attracts both locals and visitors.  With the average price of a house Â£237,000 â terrace homes selling for Â£186,000 and detached homes for Â£370,000 â Hexham is popular with lifestyle buyers and retirees.  Number 15 Tynedale Terrace, a five-bedroom Victorian home close to the town centre costs Â£495,000 (Â­finestproperties.co.uk).  Estate agents have been widely reporting a Covid-inspired exodus of buyers from the cities to country towns. Many are able to work from home, while others are still toying with a business idea which will allow them to live somewhere less vulnerable to future pandemics.  For these entrepreneurs, a market provides an ideal testing ground for their new products. Innocent Drinks, Pizza Pilgrims and The Vurger Co are three brands to have found their feet in markets.  Visit the bohemian Totnes market in Devon and you will find stall-holders selling all kinds of clothing, plants, antiques, collectables and hot food. Famed for its individuality (it even has its own currency), Totnes has a surfeit of prospective home buyers.  The majority of sales last year were terrace houses, on average selling for Â£344,000. The two-bedroom Haven Cottage in Â­Leechwell Street is for sale at Â£320,000 (marchandpetit.co.uk).  So, what makes a street market so appealing?  'It's the thought of strolling among the stalls, basket over my arm, to buy our fresh food for breakfast,' says Â­Shelagh.  'It certainly beats queuing at a supermarket till.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/property/article-8577479/Street-stalls-thriving-homes-nearby-demand.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,5595f8b2ec0d574aab9f1defb19708ea0c68b7a84916a72bf9ee13c52d3b1614,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

I recently bought a beautiful illustrated edition, published by The Folio Society and translated by Adam Thorpe. Itâs one of those novels that Iâve been meaning to read for decades but somehow never got around to.  Right now, Emma is bored in the countryside and Charles is oblivious to her ennui; I get the feeling things arenât going to work out well for them.  I usually have two books on the go, and I am about to start Summerwater by Sarah Moss, one of the most interesting writers working today.  . . . would you take to a desert island?  My first thought was David Copperfield by Charles Dickens, as itâs one of those rare books that Iâve re-read in my life (Iâm not a big re-reader).  John Boyne (pictured) revealed that he would take a trilogy by Jonathan Coe: The Rottersâ Club, The Closed Circle and Middle England to a desert island  But if Iâm on a desert island I might want the occasional laugh, so Iâm going to cheat and take a trilogy by Jonathan Coe: The Rottersâ Club, The Closed Circle and Middle England.  Iâve been a fan of Coeâs work all my adult life and the ongoing story of Benjamin Trotter and his friends in a changing England is one of the funniest but also the most moving sequences in contemporary fiction.  The last, Middle England, perfectly captured what happened in the UK in the years leading up to the B-word.  . . . first gave you the reading bug?  If I think back far enough, it was probably Enid Blytonâs Noddy. As a small boy, spending much of my time in the Carnegie Library in Dundrum, Dublin, I was obsessed with Noddy and his pals Tessie Bear, Big Ears and Bumpy Dog.  I seem to recall owning a makeshift Noddy costume that I refused to take off â it included a blue pointy hat with a bell on top. I wish I had a photo of myself in this.  John said Enid Blytonâs Noddy (pictured) first gave him the reading bug  I donât remember too much about the stories, except for the fact that, in his debut, Noddy is put on trial by the other characters of Toyland who, to their eternal ignominy, accuse him of not being a toy at all, but an ornament.  The charge is, of course, outrageous and they are proved wrong. The whole thing is positively Kafkaesque.  . . . left you cold?  Not so much a book as an author and, with apologies to her multitudinous admirers, I have to say Virginia Woolf.  Iâve never connected with any of her novels. In fairness, this is despite repeated attempts on my part.  Over the years, I have started The Waves, Orlando and The Years but never got more than about 30 pages in before realising that I have absolutely no clue whatâs going on.  I did manage to make it through Mrs Dalloway once, but that was after reading Michael Cunninghamâs The Hours, so I had a basic idea of the story.  I know that many people adore Woolf âmy sister is a huge fan â and I daresay itâs my failing, but there we are.

Or so he thought. As the day wore on, however, the 26-year-old realised this was more than just a headache after too many beers.  His heart was pounding, he was sweating and his vision was blurred. Wave after wave of fear hit him â a very real worry that he was going to die. Gradually the attacks faded, but they never completely disappeared. Clearly this was a problem that was going to hang around.  It wasnât a physical problem as such. Rather, Roberts had undergone a âtransition from simple to compound worries . . . A fear of fear. A worry about worryâ. He became transfixed by absurd thoughts, for instance that he would forget to inhale.  Josh Roberts (pictured) who was aged 26 when he was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, has penned a memoir about living with the condition  And even though the breaths kept on coming (of course), Roberts then worried that he would never be able to enjoy life because he would always be worrying about forgetting to breathe.  He tried to fix matters by avoiding things which seemed to trigger the attacks. Coffee, for example, or going to bed too early.  But this only led to new obsessions. He had to drink exactly five litres of water a day, avoid seeing friends on Sundays, and go to the loo just before bed but after turning out the light. It made his life a nightmare. Eventually, he was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder.  Depression and anxiety have long been a problem among young men â suicide is the biggest killer of males under 50 in the UK. But I think Roberts is right when he claims that todayâs world exacerbates the tendency. Social media makes us envious of other people, but weâre âconsuming curated, if not entirely invented, versionsâ of their lives.  To show how people lie, he describes the evening he spent in Pizza Express with a friend who had just been dumped by her boyfriend. She sobbed for the entire meal. Later that night he saw her Instagram post: âSuch a great evening. You canât beat Pizza Express.â  Constant access to the news is another problem. Reading about war and disaster all day long wonât do much for your mood. So Roberts largely avoids it: âNo news really is good news.â  ANXIOUS MAN by Josh Roberts (Yellow Kite Â£14.99, 208 pp)  And heâs careful on social media, only reading âcheery things or things that interest [him] â fancy architecture, funny pets, that sort of stuffâ.  Very sensible. Indeed, Roberts seems a pretty sensible chap all round. He has learned to manage his condition by accepting that even though he canât stop the anxiety, he can alter his reaction to it.  In other words, âI still get the thoughts, I just donât always believe themâ. Cognitive behavioural therapy has taught him to note down his worries, because âoften just seeing them in writing was enough to make me realise how illogical they wereâ.  This is a funny, refreshingly jargon-free book. It could be a help to young men who find themselves in the same position as Roberts, or even those whose problems arenât as extreme. In my experience, that will be plenty of them.  As Henry David Thoreau once wrote: âThe mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.â Youâd be surprised at how well they hide it. âI can seem outwardly fine,â writes Roberts, âwhile internally I am dying.â  For what itâs worth, Iâd tell Roberts that things often get easier with age. He worries about his âjob wobblesâ, about not knowing what he wants to do with his life. But in my experience thatâs what your 20s (and even 30s) are for: finding out who you are.  People talk about this thing called a mid-life crisis, but âcrisisâ literally means turning point, and arenât turning points what you have when youâre young? When youâre starting out, making mistakes, learning from them?  Hopefully Roberts will have a similar experience to those of us who endured crisis after crisis when we were his age, only to reach our 40s and discover what you might call a âmid-life calmâ.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-8577977/I-felt-fear-learnt-laugh-again.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,fab0d2b4d020d68e77e2b4e022d000cb5dae670a52446e29925a92adba016ae7,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:18:29.514156,"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 21:12:55 GMT",Author celebrates sharks and insists they aren't terrifying killers,"NATURE  EMPERORS OF THE DEEP  by William McKeever (William Collins Â£20, 272 pp)  Sharks are older than trees. The creatures first appeared 450 million years ago, way before those tall things with leaves.  Theyâve survived several extinction-level events, including the one that killed the dinosaurs. Yet now they face the biggest danger of all: us. Mankind is killing so many sharks that their future is in doubt.  William McKeeverâs book is a celebration of these incredible beasts, and a call for us to change our attitudes to them.  Those attitudes were heavily influenced by one man: Peter Benchley. His novel Jaws sold more than 20 million copies, and the movie it inspired terrified a whole generation into seeing sharks as killers, intent on devouring the occupant of every inflatable lilo they can find.  William McKeever celebrates sharks and calls for a change in our attitude towards the incredible beasts in a new book. Pictured: A great white shark in Mexico  But the truth is sharks hardly ever attack humans, and even when they do only 5 per cent of victims die. This equates to about four fatalities a year worldwide. Ants kill 30 people a year in the U.S. alone.  Most shark attacks are cases of mistaken identity â the animal assumes that a surferâs splashing foot is a fish, or that a surfboard is a seal or turtle. Sharks simply donât view humans as prey.  McKeever gets a vivid demonstration of this in the Bahamas, where his diving guide feeds reef sharks with fish held on the end of a spear. The guide deliberately positions one fish just a foot from McKeeverâs face. The shark swims in, evaluates the situation, chooses the fish then swims away.  On another trip, to the coast of Australia, McKeever sees a teacher with her class of ten-year-old children about to go for a swim. He warns her that thereâs a whitetip shark nearby. The teacher says itâs fine. He repeats the warning, but the teacher sends the kids in anyway. âInstead of stalking the children, the shark turned suddenly and headed out to sea,â he writes.  As miracles of nature, sharks take some beating. Their jaws can generate forces of three tonnes per square centimetre, allowing them to snack on turtles, whose shells protect them from just about every other creature in the sea. Their teeth are constantly replaced, with new ones ousting old ones from behind. A large shark goes through 30,000 in a lifetime.  Sharks have a layer of tissue behind their retina that reflects light for a second time, improving their eyesight as they search for prey in the murky ocean depths.  And the hammerhead has two noses. As an odour will reach them at slightly different times, it can monitor which direction the scent is coming from, giving it one more advantage over its potential meal.  Sharks even go to the barber. Or at least the barberfish. This is a species that feeds on crustaceans and parasites clinging to a sharkâs skin. The shark slows to a stop, allowing a dozen of the fish to get to work. Once it has been cleaned, it moves on and another shark takes its place.  Humans kill 100 million sharks a year, the shark trade is partly due to the demand for popular Asian dish shark-fin soup (file image)  Itâs no wonder that sharks are wary of humans: we kill 100 million of them a year.  In fact Peter Benchley, years after the success of Jaws, saw the damage for himself while scuba diving off the coast of Costa Rica. Littering the seabed were the corpses of sharks with their fins cut off. Itâs a common practice â theyâre thrown back into the sea while still alive and, unable to swim, simply sink to their deaths. For the rest of his life the author committed himself to changing the publicâs perception of the creature heâd done so much to demonise.  The shark trade is partly due to the demand for shark-fin soup, which is popular in Asia. There are also shark-skin shoes and handbags, while some people believe that eating the animalâs cartilage will help treat cancer.  This is based on the utterly mistaken notion that sharks donât get cancer themselves. Even if that were true, says one expert, eating shark products wouldnât cure cancer âany more than me eating Michael Jordan would make me better at basketballâ.  EMPERORS OF THE DEEP by William McKeever (William Collins Â£20, 272 pp)  The reason fishing poses such a threat to shark numbers is that many of the females, when caught, havenât had time to breed. They often donât become mothers until theyâre 20 or 30. (Great whites can live to 70, while itâs thought the Greenland shark might reach 400, making it easily the longest-living vertebrate in the world.)  Methods of birth vary â some shark species lay egg-like cases which hatch, while others hatch their eggs inside the womb and give birth to live pups.  The tiger shark, for instance, usually delivers 30 to 40 pups at a time. Carrying so many young obviously requires serious space: in some species the female is larger than the male. A great white can reach the same length and weight as an adult giraffe.  Sharksâ sex lives are fairly eye-watering, too. The male has two âclaspersâ (as Aristotle christened the penis-like organs), although he only uses one at a time. He inserts it into the female, then splays its tip open âlike an umbrellaâ to lock it in place.  To earn the right to do this in the first place, males compete by performing âbounce divesâ â rapid swimming patterns which require great stamina. The female observes them all, then chooses the most impressive.  Finally, if you still need convincing that Jaws doesnât see you as dinner, take the tiger shark caught in 1935 off New South Wales in Australia. Among the items in its stomach was a human arm.  As the limb featured a distinctive tattoo, the police had little trouble in identifying the victim. It was a man who had been murdered and chopped up, his body parts thrown into the water. The killer was a human. The shark was innocent.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-8577719/Why-sharks-soup.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/index.rss,23a5d57b91aa94e8ef5235d085bb6e883e93fc821e143db0d0fcfc0b68085244,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Always excepting the odd tramp and the recent fad for beards, we are squeaky clean.  But as Robert Muchembled reminds us in this startling and gruesome book, things werenât always so sweet-smelling. âThe stench in centuries past was dreadful and omnipresent,â he writes.  Robert Muchembled explores the cultural history of odours in a new book. Pictured: An 18th-century caricature shows a woman emptying her chamber pot over a musician  City streets flowed with âfaeces and urine, whether human or animalâ. Pigs, goats, stray dogs and chickens wandered freely.  Butchers chopped up carcasses and boiled tripe. Tanners fermented hides for leather goods. âVile, dirty and base artisansâ competed for space in narrow alleys.  The graveyards overflowed with their contents when it rained. Potties were emptied out of windows â indeed people went to the toilet âwherever the need took themâ, even squatting beside the table at wedding banquets.  Henry III of France gave audiences from his commode. At the Court of Louis XIII, ministers urinated on the tapestries, âin corners, on staircases and particularly in fireplacesâ. If it may be argued that civilised society has developed, and ideas about good manners and respectability evolved as people âsought to suppress every trace of manâs animal natureâ, then for a very long while we were quite bestial.  Body odour was pervasive, along with bad teeth, belching, spitting, nose blowing, scratching and eating greasy food with bare hands.  At Versailles in 1710, a princess revealed in a letter that the Royal Family enjoyed nothing more than a flatulence contest. But what this âputrid miasmaâ and these âpoisonous fumesâ led to â these fogs and sulphurous gases, and the towns no better than cesspools â was endemic ill health.  Rivers and canals were open sewers. Thatched roofs harboured vermin. People seldom washed because the body was believed to be porous, permeable to bad air. No one realised the link between dirt and bacteria, or cholera and contaminated water.  The Black Death, which killed more than a third of Europeâs population, was seen as the result not of flea bites but of âSatanâs poisonous breath corrupting the airâ, like diabolic halitosis.  Rat dropping were being used to cure kidney stones in 1689 and dog mess was smeared on the neck for throat infections. Pictured: An illustration of a wagon hauling rancid lard  The solution was to devise a bigger stink to ward off contagion. âOne foul smell drives out another,â was the belief; âpestilence [is] dispelled by even worse fetid stenchesâ.In 1713, as a bracing ploy, a doctor recommended âsniffing a latrine every morningâ.  Another tip to keep the plague at bay was to tether a billy-goat in the drawing room.  From about 1348, holding a pomander to the nostrils to âward off evil forcesâ became the fashion â the hollow silver bauble or box was stuffed with rose water, laurel leaves and vinegar. Churches and cathedrals started pumping incense about the place.  To visit the sick, medicine men in wide-brimmed hats armoured themselves with a suit of goat leather and a long-pointed mask filled with garlic. âNo part of the body came into contact with the air.â Social distancing was enforced by carrying a two-metre white pole or wand.  We can laugh at such crazy medical beliefs, at a time when everybody was doused in âpowerful scentsâ, most of them nauseating. In 1689, rat droppings were used to cure kidney stones, and dog mess was smeared on the neck for throat infections.  Women in the past tried to hold back the years with cosmetics that claimed urine and cowpats could disguise wrinkles. Pictured: Illustration crossing London's dirty streets in 18th century  Urine and cowpats were used in cosmetics, to disguise wrinkles. Pork lard âwhitens the face marvellouslyâ. Fried bees cured baldness. Hanging a toad by one leg until dead and eating the pulverised remains was a secret of eternal youth.  Just like today, women in the past tried to hold back the years. Unfortunately, the products they rubbed on their cheeks and scalps to preserve a youthful appearance were toxic â take the lead and mercury in face powder, for example â and just as disfiguring as some modern plastic surgery.  The Church, for whom cleanliness was not always next to godliness (monks stank), thundered against the use of perfume and lipstick, believing that âpaint marks out the adulterous womanâ.  It thought floral and spice-based scents exacerbated âthe insatiable sexual appetite of womenâ, who often clenched aromatic sachets between their breasts.  Perfume manufacturers, who began by creating what was hoped were âimpenetrable olfactory barriers against infectionâ and the pongs accompanying plague outbreaks, became the purveyors of scent meant purely for wellbeing and pleasure in the 18th and 19th centuries.  SMELLS by Robert Muchembled (Polity Â£17.99, 260 pp)  Orange blossom, coffee, herbs and cauliflower notes were deployed as âsofter, sweeter perfumes came into fashionâ.  Cosmetics and nice smells were (and have remained) a big business. Animal products such as musk, civet and ambergris were mixed with jasmine, citrus fruits and lavender from Provence, plus cinnamon, nutmeg and sage from the East Indies.  There was an âolfactory revolutionâ, with distilleries full of cauldrons, mortars, kilns and boilers. The advertising industry and fashion magazines instructed and persuaded consumers to accept new ideas of eroticism. To wash became posh and alluring.  The cultural history of odours is fascinating, and impinges on much else.  Not reeking and ensuring neighbours and guests donât retch is part of the âhighly codified attitudes of politenessâ, the protocols of table manners and distinctions of class.  The poor are still called âthe great unwashedâ, and handling cutlery correctly can be a minefield. Foreigners are often put down with racist remarks about their funny food smells.  Then there are lavatorial jokes and scatological material, which make up a big part of our humour â from Chaucer to the Carry On films and Rik Mayallâs Bottom.

Natural birth, natural food, natural fibres: all are excellent, I think weâd agree. But Alan Levinovitz, an American professor of religion, has a more nuanced view of the subject. He feels that the worship of nature has itself become almost religious in intensity.  His book is subtitled The Seductive Myth Of Natureâs Goodness â fighting words indeed. Nylon or rayon as good as cotton or linen? Organic carrots not innately superior to Walnut Whips? One might assume he was being contrarian just for the sake of it.  Actually, heâs not. Levinovitz is merely presenting the evidence for and against ânaturalâ things versus âunnaturalâ things, and he allows his readers to make up their own minds. His book is full of fascinating observations, facts and stories that will make you think again about topics you thought you had already made up your mind about.  Alan Levinovitz who is an American professor of religion, presents the evidence for and against 'natural' things versus 'unnatural' things in a new science book (file image)  Take natural birth, for example. When my two kids were born, this was all the rage. The idea was that if you could give birth without pain relief or medical intervention, it was somehow âbetterâ than if you ingested every drug known to humankind or even, perish the thought, had a Caesarean. I went to classes led by earth mothers explaining that if giving birth the natural way was good enough for the prehistoric tribes of Papua New Guinea, itâs good enough for us.  Levinovitz is sympathetic to such feelings, because he and his wife had them, too.  âWe wanted our childâs origin story to be perfect and pureâ¦ for us, like so many others, that meant wanting birth to be natural.â  But in the few hunter-gatherer societies that still exist around the world, between 1 and 2 per cent of mothers die in childbirth â around 40 times higher than the rate in the U.S. Infant mortality in these societies never drops below 15 to 20 per cent. The South Indian Nayaka and the Aka of the western Congo basin do not name babies for at least a year, just in case.  This is only scratching the surface of a forensically detailed argument. Natural childbirthers say that childbirth isnât a medical condition â theyâre not ill, and so they want to be as far away from the bleeping machines of hospitals as they can.  But birth is dangerous, difficult and painful, says Levinovitz. My partner would certainly agree.  In his chapter about ânaturalâ foods, Levinovitz tells us all about the trade in vanilla, the worldâs most popular flavouring.  Brands often claim they only use ânaturalâ vanilla, which suggests it has been taken from vanilla pods, most of which are farmed in Madagascar.  NATURAL by Alan Levinovitz (Profile Â£20, 272 pp)  Vanilla farming from pods is incredibly labour-intensive, as each plant has to be fertilised by hand. Only the hands of women and children are small enough to do this, so child labour is the norm.  âRealâ vanilla has thus become very expensive, although almost none of that money goes back to the impoverished Madagascan farmers.  Almost all vanilla that the rest of us consume is actually vanillin, a flavour chemical that was isolated at the end of the 19th century.  Until recently vanillin was manufactured as a by-product of the petroleum industry. Yes, the vanilla in your ice cream may come from crude oil. (Itâs probably worth emphasising here that vanillin is completely harmless, wherever itâs from.)  From there Levinovitz moves on through natural healing and the anti-vaccination loons, via back-to-nature obsessives being killed by bears and performance-enhancing drugs for athletes, to good old Gwyneth Paltrow with her ânaturalâ (ie expensive) lifestyle brand Goop.  The last third of the book ties itself up in not-terribly-interesting philosophical knots, but overall this is a splendid piece of work, as wide-ranging and original as it is well-written.

Twelve years later the children are still there, deemed unadoptable â especially darkly wild Milou who is convinced that her real parents are desperate to find her. But when the orphans discover they are to be sold as slaves, they combine their talents to escape, and to help Milou on her heartbreaking quest to find out who she is.

Her only companion is the kingâs son, Horace, and her loyal (and charismatic) lizard, Gilbert.

When 12-year-old Charlieâs long-awaited baby brother is born with a serious heart defect and his parents are visibly distraught, the scared child runs deep into the forest where he plays with his friends.  Outwardly it seems the same, but when he discovers a half-drowned, fur-clad boy in a stream and revives him, he finds himself transported back to the Stone Age.

Over the past 14 days it has seen 22.4 new cases per 100,000 residents â up from around 13 a week ago (when Spain was removed from the quarantine-free ""green"" list its figure was around 35 per 100,000; it has since risen to 78).

Measures across the Channel aimed at tackling the uptick include the introduction of mandatory face masks on the streets of Toulouse, with other cities â including Paris â expected to follow suit.

But mobile air conditioners aren't cheap. One of the best models will set you back a few hundred pounds - but that's surely a price worth paying for your comfort.  Portable air conditioners (PACs) are rated in British Thermal Units (BTU). A higher BTU number means a larger room can be cooled, although this also makes the device bigger, pricier and, in some cases, less eco-friendly. For example, a 9,000 BTU air conditioner will cool a room of 45 cubic metres, so it's worth checking what size room you'll be cooling before buying.  Aside from power, you need to consider noise.

Founded in 1903 by Henri Desgrange, editor of L'Auto newspaper, the Tour may not be the favourite stage race of the cycling cognoscenti but it is one that captures the imagination of the wider sporting public. As a result, the race is the biggest annual sporting event in the world with more live spectators than even the Olympic Games or Fifa World Cup.  When does the Tour de France start?  Just like the rest of the global sporting calendar, the Tour has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic and has subsequently switched from its traditional slot in July to the end of the summer. This year's race is scheduled to get under way in Nice on Saturday August 29, 2020.  How long is this year's Tour de France?  The total distance of the race is 3,470km â or 2,156 miles in old money.

2020-08-06 13:18:41.486887,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 10:26:26 GMT","Full moon dates for 2020, including September's Full Corn Moon","This year, space fans may have seen July's full moon turn a shade darker than usual, as the third penumbral lunar eclipse of 2020 took place.  When? July 5  August: Sturgeon Moon  Tribes in North America typically caught Sturgeon around this time, but it is also when grain and corn were gathered so is sometimes referred to as Grain Moon.  This full moon appears in the same month as the Perseid meteor shower, which peaks on August 12 and 13.  This year, a black moon (the third new moon in a season of four new moons), will also take place on August 19. However, we won't be able to see this lunar event as new moons are invisible to the naked eye.  When? August 3  Total lunar eclipses  A total lunar eclipse, otherwise known as a 'blood moon', occurs when the Moon moves into the Earthâs shadow. At the distance of the Moon, this shadow appears like the bullâs eye at the centre of a dartboard.  The umbral shadow slowly creeps across the Moonâs disc until it engulfs it completely. You might think the Moon would disappear from view at this point but this is typically not the case. The Earthâs atmosphere acts like a lens, refracting or bending the Sun's red light to infill the otherwise dark umbra. This results in the Moon's usual bright white hue transforming into a deep blood orange.  Space fans will remember that the last total lunar eclipse graced our skies on January 21, 2019. In total the celestial spectacle - which was also a full moon and a supermoon - lasted five hours, 11 minutes and 33 seconds, with its maximum totality peaking at 5:12am.  While the next total lunar eclipse is not set to take place in the UK until May 16, 2022, three prenumbral lunar eclipses occurred this year on January 10, June 5 and July 5.  This type of eclipse takes place when the Moon moves through the outer part of the Earth's shadow, also known as the penumbra, causing a slight darkening of the lunar surface. Therefore, it is easily mistaken for a normal full moon and unlike a total lunar eclipse, it can be difficult to notice or observe.  Once in a blue moon  Does this well-known phrase have anything to do with the Moon? Well, yes it does. We use it to refer to something happening very rarely and a blue moon is a rare occurrence.  A monthly blue moon is the name given to a second full moon that occurs in a single calendar month and this typically occurs only once every two to three years. In 2020, the Hunter's Moon on October 31 will also be a blue moon because it is the second full moon to occur in October.  A seasonal blue moon describes the third of four full moons to occur in an astronomical season. In 2019, May's Flower Moon was a seasonal blue moon.  There's lots of other moons, too - how many do you know?  Full moon: We all know what these are. They come around every month and light up the sky at night.  New moon: Sometimes known as the invisible phase, as it generally can't be seen in the sky. It's when the Sun and Moon are aligned, with the Sun and Earth on opposite sides of the Moon. As a result, the side of the Moon that faces the Earth is left in complete darkness.  Black moon: Most experts agree that this refers to the second new moon in a calendar month, while some use the term to describe the third new moon in a season of four new moons. The last black moon took place on August 30, 2019, which was also a super new moon, and the next one is set to take place on August 19, 2020.  Blood moon: Also known as a total lunar eclipse. It's when the shadow of Earth casts a reddish glow on the moon, the result of a rare combination of an eclipse with the closest full moon of the year. There was one in the UK in January 2019, with the next one set to be visible over South America, North America and parts of Europe and Africa on May 16, 2022. Space fans in the UK won't be able to see every phase of this eclipse, but should be able to see it at totality when the Moon appears with a reddish-orange glow.  What is a supermoon?  Ever looked up at the night sky to see a full moon so close you could almost touch it? Well you've probably spotted a supermoon.  The impressive sight happens when a full moon is at the point in its orbit that brings it closest to Earth. To us Earth-lings, it appears up to 30 per cent brighter and 14 per cent bigger.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/0/full-moon-dates-uk-2020-september-corn-moon/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml,94892529a70cd629bb4c23b2fe9acb7003e4e5d43d3e3bc74446f24fbcdf45bc,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

A: Ofqual, the exam regulator, is not going to publish the full statistical model that is has used to calculate grades until results days. So far, Ofqual has said which datasets will be used in the model although it has not specified the weighting that each dataset has been given. The datasets that will be used in the statistical model include:  The exam results of students who took the same subject at the same school in 2017, 2018 and 2019  Prior attainment data on students at the same school in 2017, 2018 and 2019  Prior attainment data on this yearâs students  The outcome of this statistical model will then be placed on top of the rank order which teachers submitted to exam boards. When drawing up the rank order, teachers ordered students them from best to worst for each subject.  Teachers were also been asked to come up with a predicted grade for each student, based on their mock exams, tests, coursework and homework. For new schools, which do not have historic data, as well as small schools or those in which low numbers of students are taking particular subjects, teachers' predictions will be the ""primary source"" of evidence for their grades this summer.  But for the majority of schools, results will be determined by the statistical model and the rank order rather than by teachersâ predicted grades.  Ofqual said that teachers' predicted grades were an ""important component"" in the process as they helped teachers to draw up the rank order. The predicted grades were also useful for testing out different statistical models and for ""quality assurance"" of the end results, the watchdog said.  Q: When will A-level and GCSE results be released?  A: A-level results day is Thursday, August 13 and GCSE results day is the following Thursday, August 20.  Q: What if students are not happy with their grades?  A: Students are currently only allowed to appeal against their grade on very narrow, technical grounds. Appeals are permitted if a school can prove that it did not follow the process correctly, for example if they made a mistake when submitting data, rank order or any other information to the exam board. Schools could also challenge a grade if they believe the exam board made a mistake when calculating, assigning or communicating a grade to a student.  If students believe their grades are too low and that they could have done better, then the only option is to take a new set of exams this autumn. Ofqual has confirmed that exam boards must put on âappeal examsâ in every single subject, with AS and A-levels held in October and GCSEs in November. If a student gets a higher grade in their appeal exam, this result will replace their previous grade on their record.  Q: What will happen about university places?  A: Universities have promised to be ""flexible"" when it comes to admissions, and have moved to reassure students that they will not be disadvantaged by this exceptional set of circumstances. Many universities initially changed their offers to be ""unconditional"", meaning students will be offered places irrespective of their A-level grades. However, the higher education regulator, the Office for Students, has urged universities to stop doing this as they are concerned that it is not in studentsâ best interests.  Q: How will the Government make sure this year's GCSE and A-level students are not disadvantaged â or advantaged â by their exams being cancelled?  A: Officials have said that, when it comes to their permanent record, this cohort of students' grades will be ""indistinguishable"" from those in previous years. The exam regulator has said it will make sure the distribution of grades is similar to previous years, so that this group of students do not face any ""systematic disadvantage"".",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/0/a-level-gcse-results-2020-how-grades-calculated-without-exams/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml,e4ab071b50ed6f6dffa1a0cbb8bead0d25a5dd41dbb2864a65d2ff9cd887da9a,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

As many as four million people in Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire are now banned from meeting people from different households indoors.  The decision comes after Public Health England data showed coronavirus cases reaching worrying levels across the region. In the past week, there have been 69 cases per 100,000 in Blackburn with Darwen, which has now surpassed Leicester, where the infection rate has fallen to 50 cases per 100,000.  Effective from Friday, the new restrictions extend to Greater Manchester, Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Hyndburn, Pendleton, Rossendale, Bradford, Kirklees and Calderdale.  Here are the rules as they apply in the affected areas:  Can I go and visit my family at home?  If they live in one of the affected areas, the answer is no. Two households are no longer permitted to meet at home or in a private garden, except where they have formed a support bubble.  What if they want to visit me?  The same rule applies. Even if you live outside the lockdown zone, they are not allowed to come to your home.  Could we still go to the pub or a restaurant together?  No. Under the new lockdown restrictions, pubs and restaurants will remain open but two households will no longer be allowed to mix indoors. The restriction extends to cafes, shops, places of worship, community centres, leisure and entertainment venues.  The relevant businesses have also been advised to monitor customers to make sure they are not interacting with other households.  New laws are being implemented to enforce the changes, with police able to take action if people flout the ban on meeting in homes and gardens. They will have the power to break up gatherings and issue fines of up to Â£100, which will double for subsequent offences.  So I cannot see my family or friends, then?  Not quite. People living in the lockdown zones can still continue to meet in outdoor public spaces in groups of up to six people. They will still be required to socially distance.  Can I go to work?  There is no restriction on travelling to and from the office.  Are any businesses closing?  Yes, but only in specific locations. In Blackburn with Darwen, and in Bradford, indoor gyms, fitness and dance studies, sports courts, swimming pools and water parks will remain closed by law.  Can we still celebrate Eid?  Yes, although the rules mean people cannot meet indoors or host family and friends as you might normally. Instead, any gatherings will need to take place outdoors and be limited to groups of six, unless they are two households (in which case there is not a limit).  People can also attend mosque, provided the venues are Covid-secure and they are observing social distancing. However, the Government is encouraging religious leaders to hold prayers and services outdoors.  Can I still come out of shielding if considered clinically vulnerable?  Unfortunately not. The relaxations to shielding, due to commence on August 1, have been suspended for the areas within the new lockdown zones.  Should I cancel my wedding?  Weddings and civil partnership ceremonies are still permitted, with up to 30 people able to attend. However, large receptions or parties afterwards should not go ahead. People can also travel in and out of lockdown zones to attend weddings.  Funerals of the same size can also take place.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/06/north-england-lockdown-rules-manchester-blackburn-bradford/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml,297d0fcf8f51d322f6dab73fa29659eae03b5faf21552e3872dfc29215809e2b,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

He told the Telegraph that the phrase âimplies that this [virus] will act as the flu actsâ, with seasonal peaks and troughs and rapid mutations. âWe don't know that - it might, but it might not.â  During the Spanish influenza pandemic, for instance, the virus spread throughout the northern hemisphere during the spring of 1918, while cases dwindled in the summer. But in the autumn a second, far deadlier wave materialised after the virus mutated.  The World Health Organization has warned against âthinking about seasonsâ. âWhat we all need to get our heads around is this is a new virus and this one is behaving differently,â Margaret Harris, a spokesperson at the UN agency, told a virtual press conference in Geneva this week.  She added that the virus is instead unfolding in âone big waveâ - a trend that is evident from a global perspective.  It is now six months since the World Health Organization declared a global health emergency - the highest possible alert under international law - and cases are still accelerating. A total of 16 million infections have now been detected, but the overall figure has doubled in the last six weeks.  So it is unsurprising that countries are seeing an upturn in cases as they attempt to return to some semblance of normality, Hans Kluge, WHOâs regional director for Europe, told BBC Radio Four on Wednesday: the first wave never really stopped.

Latest news on UK trials,"The findings, led by the National Institutes of Health, have not been peer-reviewed or published, but Professor Robin Shattock, Professor of Mucosal Infection and Immunity, Imperial College London, called the early results ""encouraging"".  He added: ""This is a promising start, but efficacy data will be key followed by an ability to scale in a manner that provides global access should this vaccine be successful.""  US president, Donald Trump, has said the US would start mass production of any vaccines developed before they are fully approved so that they can be quickly distributed once rubber-stamped.  It has also been reported that GSK and Sanofi have teamed up to develop a coronavirus treatment, and plan to have a vaccine ready for testing by the end of 2020.  Germany announced it will invest â¬300m (Â£269m) in a private biotech firm on the brink of clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine.  Its purchase of a 23 per cent stake in CureVac comes after reported attempts by the Trump administration to court the firm and secure supply of any future vaccine sparked political backlash in Berlin. CureVac rejected claims in March that it had received acquisition offers for the company or its technology.  Positive early results for Chinese drug company  On June 17, a Chinese drug company has announced positive early results of a vaccine, claiming it induced an immune response in 100 per cent of those who were given it.  The vaccine is being developed by the firm China National Biotec Group (CNBG) and is one of the frontrunners among more than 200 other candidates in the race to develop an effective inoculation against the disease.  Chinese biotech, Sinovac, also announced positive results for its coronavirus vaccine, saying it was hoping to move to large-scale phase three trials in Brazil soon.  Africaâs first participation in a Covid-19 vaccine trial started on June 24 as volunteers received injections developed at the University of Oxford, while officials said the continent of 1.3 billion people cannot be left behind.  The large-scale trial is being conducted in South Africa, Britain and Brazil.  Russia's vaccine: does it work?  The World Health Organisation (WHO) has urged caution over Russia's potential coronavirus vaccine, which remains far behind other vaccines being developed.  Russia is planning to proceed with mass vaccinations in October, and its treatment is among 140 possible vaccines that are currently in development globally.  But the WHO has urged caution and said that while approximately two dozen candidate vaccines are in clinical trials, including the Russian one, no second or third-phase trials from the country have been listed to date.  A document released by the WHO shows that the jab developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute in Moscow is far behind some of the other prospective medicines, and is still in phase one trials.  The Telegraph has revealed that Britain is likely to reject a vaccine from Russia, amid serious concerns over its trial processes.  Other treatments being trialled  Alongside vaccine development, doctors are trialling existing drugs for viruses such as Ebola, malaria and HIV. Early results seem promising but, until full clinical trials have been concluded, doctors cannot be certain that the drugs are effective.  The Oxford University-led trial of hydroxychloroquine, originally a malaria drug, was hailed by Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, in April as a ""major milestone"" in the battle against Covid-19.  However, the results of an international study by WHO indicate that it increases the chances of death for hospitalised patients by nine to 21 per cent.  The organisation suspended its trial on May 25, citing safety concerns. But on May 26, the leaders of the Oxford-led Recovery trial, which operates in NHS hospitals, said they would continue on the basis their data did not show an increased risk.  Dexamethasone breakthrough  The world's first coronavirus treatment that significantly reduces the risk of death is being given to NHS patients following groundbreaking trials by British scientists.  In a breakthrough described by Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, as a ""remarkable achievement"", the common steroid dexamethasone was shown to radically improve the chances of survival for the most ill patients.  On June 16, Mr Johnson hailed the result as the ""biggest breakthrough yet"" in the treatment of coronavirus, both in Britain and globally.  The Government has been stockpiling dexamethasone since March in case the trials were successful. There are already supplies for 200,000 patients, and enough to cope with any second wave of the virus.  The drug â commonly used to treat arthritis, severe allergies and asthma â costs just Â£5 for a full course of treatment and is expected to have a major impact on the pandemic.  Scientists at Oxford University, who have been conducting trials on a number of drugs since March, announced that a 10-day course of dexamethasone lowers the risk of death for people on ventilators by one third.  The researchers said the drug should become the standard of care in the most sick patients.  UK vaccine taskforce  On April 17, the government launched a taskforce - set up under the Department for Business, Education and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) - designed to ""rapidly develop a coronavirus vaccine"", as well as scale up manufacturing so it can be quickly produced and delivered in mass quantities.  It is led by Sir Patrick Vallance and Professor Jonathan van Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Officer, and members will include pharmaceutical companies, such as AstraZeneca, as well as the Wellcome Trust.  The government has initially earmarked Â£14 million to plough into 21 coronavirus research projects - such as the work by the scientists at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London. On April 21, an announcement of a further Â£44.5 million for the Oxford and Imperial trials increased this funding further still.  A few weeks later the Business Secretary, Alok Sharma announced a further Â£84 million in new funding ""to help accelerate their work"".  He said: ""This new money will help mass-produce the Oxford vaccine so that if current trials are successful we have dosages to start vaccinating the UK population straight away.""  To help the UK mass produce a vaccine, Mr Sharma has announced the UK's first vaccines manufacturing innovation centre is expected to open in summer 2021, a year ahead of schedule.  He said: ""To further support our domestic manufacturing capabilities last month, I announced the Government would accelerate building the UK's first vaccines manufacturing innovation centre, which is based at Harwell in Oxfordshire.  ""And today I can announce we will invest up to a further Â£93 million in the centre ensuring that it opens in summer 2021, a full 12 months ahead of schedule. ""The centre, which is already under construction, will have capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months.""

Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, has hailed the two new tests, both of which can detect the presence of coronavirus and flu viruses in the same sample outside a specialised laboratory, as âa big step forwardâ.  Almost half a million of the new tests will be available from next week, the Department of Health and Social Care said, with millions more expected to be made available later in the year. The tests will enable clinicians and NHS Test and Trace staff to differentiate between Covid-19, which requires sufferers to undergo specific self-isolation, and other viruses.  Speaking to BBC News Mr Hancock said: âWe're on track to deliver half a million tests a day by the end of October, but new technologies, like these two, will help us to accelerate that.  âWhat that means in real life is that more people are going to be able to get tested more quickly so we can find out where the virus is and tackle it and keep those rates of infection down.â  He added the new rapid tests will enable the Government to expand testing capacity further and into different settings, such as schools.  ""But also looking across the community where we want to test people who don't have symptoms to find out where the virus is,â he added.  How do the new tests work?  The two new tests announced by the Government include DNA tests and swab tests. Some 5,000 âNudgeboxâ machines, supplied by a biotech called DnaNudge, will provide 5.8 million tests in the coming months, the department said.  The machines, already in use in eight London hospitals, analyse the DNA in nose swabs and can process up to 15 tests on the spot each day, giving a result in up to 90 minutes. They can be operated outside a laboratory and do not require staff to undergo specialist training. More machines will be rolled out across NHS hospitals from September.  The machine was launched last year to analyse and map a personâs genetic profile to key nutrition related issues, such as obesity and cholesterol, enabling patients to be ânudgedâ towards healthier eatingâ. The technology has now been adapted to be able to identify Covid-19.  Professor Chris Toumazou, CEO and co-founder of DnaNudge and founder of the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College London, said: âWe are extremely proud to be playing such a pivotal role in supporting the national effort on testing, as this major contract award signifies.â  He added: âWe have been able to successfully adopt our in-store consumer DNA testing technology - which identifies genetic risks for chronic conditions related to obesity and type 2 diabetes - and validate it for detecting Covid-19 with gold standard accuracy.â  The second new test, known as the LamPORE test will be able to process swab and saliva samples to detect the presence of Covdi-19 in 60 to 90 minutes. The new test, developed by Oxford Nanopore which spun out of Oxford University, has the same sensitivity as the widely-used PCR swab test but can process swabs outside specialist laboratories.  A palm-sized machine will process up to 2,000 tests a day while the larger desktop machine will be able to analyse up to 15,000 tests.  Gordon Sanghera, CEO of Oxford Nanopore, said: âLamPORE has the potential to deliver a highly effective and, crucially, accessible global testing solution, not only for Covid-19 but for a range of other pathogens. We are delighted to be working with the UK government to support and empower our communities to effectively manage testing at a national and localised level.â  Where can I get hold of the tests?  These new tests are not available to purchase over the counter or online, but you may be tested using one through the Governmentâs Test and Trace scheme.  Nearly half a million (450,000) of the new LamPORE tests will be available from next week across adult care settings, NHS testing laboratories and Lighthouse laboratories, the Department of Health and Social Care said. The DnaNudge kits will be supplied to NHS hospitals.  The testing kits may also be introduced to ânon-traditional settingsâ such as schools or could be used in hospitals to provide regular testing of staff.  How accurate are the new tests?  The Nudgebox was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency in April after trials showed that it achieved sensitivity (the rate of positive tests) of 98 per cent and specificity (rate of negative tests) of 100 per cent. Regulators generally ask for 80 per cent sensitivity and 97 per cent specificity so this test performed well.  LamPORE is in the process of gaining regulatory approval which is expected imminently and it will publish data on accuracy when approval comes through.  In a statement the company said it had been working with âmultipleâ clinical laboratories in the UK to evaluate the performance of its test.  Sir John Bell, Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford University, who has been advising the government on tests, said they both tests produced the same ""sensitivity"" as the current lab-based tests.  Why is rapid testing important?  The new tests are good news for a number of reasons : not only do they test for multiple viruses but they will also increase current testing capacity - the government has been much criticised for its poor record in this area. However, the biggest breakthrough is their speed.  Most tests take around 24 hours and the longer someone is walking around with the coronavirus, the more likely it is they will infect other people.  Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, head of emerging infectious diseases at the World Health Organization, said that rapid testing was vital to helping control the pandemic. âItâs very important that when you have a test you have answers quickly. Weâre seeing in many parts of the world it takes a long time to get a test back,â she said.  Once someone has tested positive they can self isolate and their contacts can be traced. âThis is what will break the chains of transmission,â said Dr Van Kerkhove.

After a nationwide lockdown that lasted almost four months, many restrictions on daily life were lifted on July 4.  However, the Government's strategy has now turned to focus on local lockdowns, targeting areas which have suffered outbreaks. On June 30, Leicester became the first UK city to be plunged back into lockdown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that schools and nurseries will reopen from July 24.  Meanwhile, officials have introduced new measures in Blackburn and Oldham.

More than 17.2 million tests for Covid-19 have been carried out in the UK and the Government's plan to tackle the pandemic involves a number of gradual phases, but experts warn there could be a second wave on the horizon.  Despite this, on Friday July 17, Prime Minister Boris Johnson set out his roadmap for ending lockdown, with remaining leisure facilities to reopen and all beauty treatments to resume from August 1. Mr Johnson also announced that official guidance advising people to ""work from home if you can"" will be relaxed in a bid to restart the economy.

Probably not, but they are by far the most common risk.  The NHS and WHO are advising doctors that the virus is also likely to be contained in other bodily secretions including blood, faeces and urine.  Here again, hand and surface hygiene is the key.  How can I protect my family, especially children?  Children are a major vector for the spread of droplet-based viruses because they interact physically so much with each other and are not the best at keeping themselves clean.  The virus appears to impact older people more commonly but children can be infected and they can get severe illness, the government warns.  However, you can greatly lower the risk that children pose of spreading or catching viruses by:  Explaining to them how germs spread and the importance of good hand and face hygiene  Ensuring that they stick to the rules on social distancing so no meeting up with friends however bored they are getting  Keeping household surfaces clean, especially kitchens, bathrooms, door handles and light switches  Using clean or disposable cloths to wipe surfaces so you don't transfer germs from one surface to another  Giving everyone their own towel and making sure they know not to share toothbrushes etc  Keep your home dry and airy (bugs thrive in musty environments)  The Government is advising that people stay at home and practise social distancing. Stay at least three metres away from other people.  Do not go to work unless it's essential.  Are some groups of people more at risk than others?  Data from China suggests that people of all ages are at risk of contracting the virus, although older people are more likely to develop serious illness.  People with a reduced chance of surviving pneumonia include:  Those over age 65  Children under the age of two  People with underlying health conditions or a weakened immune system  Of the first 425 confirmed deaths across mainland China, 80 per cent were in people over the age of 60, and 75 per cent had some form of underlying disease.  However, young people are not ""invincible"" as the WHO has warned and they must follow official advice.  Is there a vaccine for coronavirus?  There is currently no vaccine, but scientists around the world are racing to produce one thanks to China's prompt sharing of the virus's genetic code.  However, any potential vaccine will not be available for up to a year and would be most likely to be given to health workers most at risk of contracting the virus first. In addition, researchers in China believe that the virus may have mutated into two strains, one of which is highly aggressive, making a search for a vaccine more difficult.  For now, it is a case of containment and increasing hospital capacity to treat patients. The UK government's conornavirus action plan aims to delay and flatten the epidemic curve of the disease to avoid the NHS from becoming overwhelmed as happened in Wuhan.  Capacity to treat patients who require hospital care is already becoming a major challenge for the NHS - this is what has prompted the government lockdown.

But amid the outside skepticism and a stream of North Korean propaganda glorifying its virus efforts, an exchange between Pyongyang and the United Nations is providing new clarity - and actual numbers - about what might be happening in the North, which has closed its borders and cut travel - never a free-flowing stream - by outsider monitors and journalists.  In late July, North Korea said it had imposed its ""maximum emergency system"" to guard against the virus spreading after finding a person with Covid-19 symptoms in Kaesong city, near the border with rival South Korea.  State media reported that leader Kim Jong-un then ordered a total lockdown of Kaesong, and said the suspected case was a North Korean who had earlier fled to South Korea before slipping back into Kaesong last month.  North Korea's public admission of its first potential case and the emergency steps it took prompted immediate outside speculation that Pyongyang may be worried about a big outbreak after months of steadfastly claiming it had no cases. Foreign experts are highly skeptical over the North's assertion of no cases, in large part because of its long, porous border with China, where the virus emerged, and its history of hiding past disease outbreaks.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/08/06/north-koreas-escalating-virus-response-raises-fear-outbreak/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml,fc016fe438c8c358e2ffb94504a56ff155b109e82c6b5302cc4a23a462359943,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Both in the original and revised calendar, Milan-Sanremo is the first of the five monuments of cycling â the others being Il Lombardia, LiÃ¨ge-Bastogne-LiÃ¨ge, Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix â and at 299 kilometres it is the longest one-day race in professional road racing.  The late Tom Simpson became the first British rider to win Milan-Sanremo in 1964 when he outwitted Frenchman Raymond Poulidor on the final Poggio climb before claiming the first of three monuments on his palmarÃ¨s. Mark Cavendish became the second and, as yet, only other Briton to win the race after pipping Heinrich Haussler to the line in 2009.

According to preliminary investigations, Lebanese port officials had spent years calling for the removal of the dangerous chemicals from the waterfront warehouse that exploded killing at least 135 people and wrecking the homes of 300,000 residents. Tuesday's blast was likely to have been caused by the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of ammonium nitrate that had been stored at the dock since being confiscated from a cargo ship in 2014. Middle East Correspondent Campbell MacDiarmid reports that a source close to a port employee said a team that inspected the material six months ago warned it could ""blow up all of Beirut"" if not removed.

For Semi-Detached, given a full series after last yearâs well-received pilot, he is supported by a seasoned comic cast and a premise â each episode takes place in real time â that ensures no let-up in incident. The momentum of mounting frantic desperation, reminiscent of Ben Miller vehicle Worst Week of my Life, generally overrides the occasional clichÃ© and lazy gag.  Picking up four months on from the chaotic pilot, when Stuartâs (Lee Mack) much-younger girlfriend April (Ellie White) gave birth to their baby girl, domestic mayhem is ascendant and their relationship on the rocks, despite Stuartâs bumbling efforts to impress her and manage a midlife crisis embodied by his distracting moustache. âI try. I try so hard but everything I do goes wrong,â he pleads. A make-or-break date is derailed by the plotting of Stuartâs bong-smoking, promiscuous father (louche Clive Russell), his ex-wifeâs husband (pompous Patrick Baladi) and his dodgy brother (wheedling Neil Fitzmaurice), and the escalating farce is well handled by director Ben Palmer.

Surviving the Virus: My Brother and Me, BBC One  âââââ  At a time when Covid-19 has denied families the right to visit their loved ones in hospital, it has been galling to see celebrity TV presenters given access-all-areas to the wards for a spot of light investigative reporting. Ross Kemp did it for ITV a couple of months back. The ubiquitous Stacey Dooley was at it last week, hovering over a baby being resuscitated at a maternity unit.  Thank goodness for the Van Tulleken twins, Chris and Xand, who are accomplished television presenters but also actual doctors whose presence in hospital is a help rather than a hindrance. Chris is an infectious diseases doctor at University College London Hospitals and Xand works in public health, and both are well-practised at delivering information in an accessible way. In Surviving the Virus: My Brother and Me (BBC One), they went back to the front line of care. The film followed staff who are treating desperately ill patients, but also looked at the longer-term effects of the disease which have received scant coverage until now.

Commenting on the findings, Rachael Lloyd, a relationship expert at eharmony, told The Daily Telegraph: âNo doubt, people mentally heard the phrase âBond, James Bondâ in Sean Connery's famous burr as they responded.  âA major reason for this popularity is that he is someone who is familiar to all age groups, who know him as the suave, sophisticated 'original' Bond and as such, link the accent to these qualities. The fact that these universal associations stand the test of time have a really significant impact on how people perceive others with the same accent.â  In the study, participants listened to the same 40 voice recordings read by actors in different accents, before ranking the clips for traits such as charm, good humour and intelligence.  The sentence read: âIn Britain we can expect rain at any time of the year. While winter is wetter than summer, seasonal differences in rainfall are very small.â  Received pronunciation was seen as the most attractive accent with an average score of 3.34, due to its association with intelligence, followed by the New Zealand accent on 3.06, and Edinburgh was third at 2.91.  In contrast, the Cornish dialect ranked last for attractiveness, with a score of 2.28, although it was rated highly in relation to a good sense of humour.  But the distinctive Celtic twang only marginally lost out to Spanish and French, which came 18th and 19th respectively.  Researchers said views on accents are largely shaped by perceptions of celebrities speaking with them on TV and in films.

Lingard had at least demonstrated some of the urgency his Manchester United team-mates lacked and kickstarted a comeback against LASK with his second goal in as many games before being taken off, somewhat strangely, only six minutes later.  Needing games, and with little prospect of starting Mondayâs Europa League quarter-final against Copenhagen in Cologne, according to Scholes, the former United midfielder viewed Lingardâs premature withdrawal as further evidence that Solskjaer might be making preparations to âget ridâ of Lingard.  Lingardâs future at Old Trafford is uncertain but he could at least count himself unfortunate not to finish this drab game, his frustration at being substituted obvious as he left the field and also after the game. âI was enjoying the game and I enjoy football matches,â he said. âI felt like I could score more today but obviously itâs the managerâs decision and I stand by that. Of course, you take confidence from goals. I wanted to add goals this season and hopefully now I can carry on throughout the rest of this competition.â  Solskjaer once again sidestepped a question about Lingardâs future but said he would be âdisappointedâ if the player had been happy about coming off. âIâve known Jesse since he was a kid, thereâs a good player there, a great personality, he knows what we want from him and he has to stand by the manager whatever decision he makes,â the United manager said.  Lingard has scored as many goals in the past 11 days as he did in the previous eight months and his finish from Juan Mataâs through ball drew United level moments after a stunning 25-yard strike from Philipp Wiesinger had given LASK a deserved lead.

And now, the 22-year-old rookie from Hertfordshire is threatening to leave the star names in her shade once again after taking a commanding lead after the first round of the three-day Computacenter Grand Final of the Rose Ladies Series.  After missing the first green at North Hants, the fine Fleet layout where Justin Rose learned to play the game, Hewson proceeded to hit the next 17 greens in succession. It was a remarkable bogeyless display in windy conditions and her dominance was written all over the scoreboard as the only player under par.  With a four-under 66, Hewson is four clear of her nearest pursuers - Kentâs Sian Evans and Australian Whitney Hillier - with another stroke back to Liz Young and Inci Mehmet in fourth and a group on two-over, including Georgia Hall and Charley Hull.  âI just played very solidly and struck the ball really well,â she said. âItâs funny, but I played here five years in the Hampshire Hog [the elite amateur event] and remembered that you should play sensibly and lay up short of the greens and allow it to bounce on. It worked! I know Iâm quite a few clear but all Iâm going to do is stick to my gameplan and play fairways and greens.â  Even with double-points on offer, Hewson cannot quite top of the American Golf Order of Merit, which comes with a Â£20,000 bonus for the winner. Hall and Hull are the top two in the standings, with the latter knowing that should she win the tournament proper then Hall will not be able to stop her scooping the bounty.  However, neither will be satisfied with their 72s, regardless of the severity of the test. Hull was one-under after five, but then the world No 25 failed up to pick up a single birdie with three bogeys on the sixth, ninth and 17th. In contrast, Hall had a poor start dropping two shots in the first three holes, before battling back to level par - and then bogeying the last two holes.

Englandâs best period was the hour before lunch when Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer ripped out Abid Ali and Azhar Ali with accurate, hostile bowling, conceding only 19 runs in 11 overs. Woakes was the leading bowler, outperforming James Anderson as Englandâs pitch-it-up seamer. Archer was in rhythm, holding back his pace to hit a good length or bowl short forcing the batsmen to play or duck.  At 52 for two, England had control but their grip loosened after lunch in a wasteful hour when Babar and Masood built their partnership and took control.  Babar had taken 14 balls to make his first run in that tricky last half hour of the morning session but Andersonâs first ball to him after the break was wide down the leg side, which he eased to the fine leg boundary. He was away.  After flicking Andersonâs first ball for four, Babar whipped him off his legs for another boundary in his next over before timing a perfect drive on the up through the covers for the shot of the day. Andersonâs three overs cost 16 runs and he was replaced by Woakes. Babar hit a Broad full toss for another boundary and drove Archerâs first ball after lunch down the ground four. This was high class, attractive batting.  Archer also bowled some poor deliveries to Babar and it was not a fair contest between young Bess and a batsman who averages 103.66 against spin since 2018.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2020/08/05/england-vs-pakistan-first-test-day-one-live-score-latest-updates/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml,30f055a8c39feef2681d517f062a0e9ae91bd9f18c5ef647ebfbce79f8d254de,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The lack of financial autonomy due to a reliance on member state funding from countries like the US has meant that the agency facilitates vertical health programmes in poorer nations which are short term, fragmented and not self-sustaining.  Without the USâ funding, these initiatives will exist in silos and may also potentially come to a standstill as they require expensive resources and human capital.  The Ebola epidemic of 2014 surfaced an unprecedented attention to the WHO and its failure to deal with the spread of infectious diseases adequately.  Although this was tied mostly to the agencyâs governance, an internal 2015 review highlighted the need for a contingency fund to curb further outbreaks. Therefore, further reduction in the agencyâs funding capacity could diminish the legitimacy and ability to respond to global health emergencies in poorer nations.  Ultimately, the WHO is a crucial steward for global health emergencies and pivotal in maintaining standards for less economically developed countries.  It has constantly tried to set reforms to improve coordinating global health initiatives and has already launched an independent inquiry into the organisationâs global responses to the pandemic. The US government should look to add input into reforming the WHO instead of de-funding it as diseases have little respect for borders.

But what's the best juicer for you? And is juicing really worth all the extra washing up?  You may already know the difference between juices and smoothies (if not, FYI, juicing is the process of extracting the liquid content from fruit and vegetables, while a smoothie is made by blending whole fruits and vegetables together)  But do you know the difference between centrifugal juicers and cold-press masticating juicers? No? Well, these things matter in the world of juicing.  A masticating juicer methodically squashes and pounds the liquid out of foods. It tends to be more expensive and produce cleaner, calmer juice.  A centrifugal juicer uses a fast revolving, spinning blade (much like a home blender) and a mesh to separate the juice from the pulp. It's s fast, noisy, and its juice can be quite frothy.  There's an argument that slower, cold-press masticating juicers are healthier, because centrifugal juicers expose the food to high heat, produced by the whirring blade, and this destroys all-important enzymes. That said, it's a struggle to find scientific research that backs up the claim.

This has resulted in a steady decline in maternal mortality and Sri Lanka has one of the lowest rates in the region â in 2017 there were 36 deaths per 100,000 live births compared to 145 in India and 173 in Bangladesh.  Yet despite all this progress abortion remains taboo.  âThe mainstream discourse is a moralistic discourse and that is how itâs always been,â said Subha Wijesiriwardena, programme coordinator at the Women and Media Collective.  In 1995, the government tried to reform the abortion laws, which have remained unchanged since the colonial era. But lawmakers bowed to anti-abortion sentiment and backtracked on the proposed amendments. Attempts at reform in 2011 and 2013 also failed.  âHaving the weight of that criminalisation obviously causes a lot of problems in terms of accessing services and generally adds to the stigma and secretiveness around sexual and reproductive health,â said Ms Wijesiriwardena  In 2017, the Justice Aluvihare Special Committee recommended that abortion be permitted in cases of serious foetal impairments, incest, rape and pregnancy of minors under age 16. But legislation based on this proposal has since stalled, with some local media and activists citing religious groupsâ opposition as a key reason.  Sri Lankans go to the polls on Wednesday, with the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) party expected to further secure power, channeling the momentum of Novemberâs presidential win for President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.  The SLPP prime ministerial candidate is former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, brother of Gotabaya Rajapaksa. The SLPPâ whose base is Sinhala Buddhistâ has been accused by Amnesty International of intimidating and harassing journalists and human rights activists that have been critical of the government.  Yet with opposition parties divided, and widespread public support for the governmentâs handling of Covid-19, the SLPP looks set to further centralize power. And little is expected to change regarding the abortion stalemate in Parliament.  âThe pro- and anti-abortion lobby has always been this hand-wringing about moralityâ or the immorality of itâ and that is obviously hugely shaped by the church, and that is where it comes from,â said Ms Wijesiriwardena.  Despite Catholics making up only a tiny proportion of the population â around six per cent â they are vociferously anti abortion and have disproportionate influence.  Marie Stopes International, an NGO specialising in sexual and reproductive health, ran clinics within Sri Lanka whose services included abortion. The clinics were shut down by the government in 2007 â in a move that was attributed to pressure from the Catholic Church â though some are now up and running again.  Catholics have a visible presence within the medical field in Sri Lanka. They have their own professional organisationâ the Catholic Doctors' Guild of St. Luke, Saints Cosmas and Damian, and members have close ties with Catholic clergy over matters, such as abortion, where the church position differs from broader social practices. The Archbishop of Colombo â Malcolm Ranjith â has been outspoken in his condemnation of efforts to reform abortion legislation.  It is this decades-old conflict that Achala found herself confronting. Speaking quietly but confidently, her hands clutching the handle of the bag resting in her lap, she recounts how she learned she was pregnant. In 2017, she already had a four year-old son when she discovered she was expecting and she knew she couldnât keep a second child.  Achalaâs husband is an alcoholic, and at the time he suspected she was having an affair. Achala denies this but she did not want to bring a baby into such a hostile environment.  She works as a sewing machine operator in one of the countryâs many garment factories but women like her, who have left their homes to work in these factories are often viewed as promiscuous.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/women-and-girls/sri-lankas-backstreet-abortions-hundreds-women-take-daily-risks/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml,bd27d383db38de11c26b9e187177d1f3aafef6ca119cdb93046f0b7dad1da909,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Here we count down our 10 favourite shows of 2020 so far, along with where you can find them.  Best TV shows of 2020 so far...  10. The Windermere Children (BBC Two, January)  The year got off to a strong start with this one-off drama telling the little-known story of 305 orphaned Jewish children, rescued from concentration camps, who began new lives in the Lake District in summer 1945. The compassionate story of survival by writer Simon Block and director Michael Samuels was beautifully made and deeply moving â culminating in a breathtaking ending, when the excellent Polish teen actors were suddenly replaced by their real-life counterparts: still alive, telling us about their happy and fulfilled lives.

This Country (BBC Three, February-March)  The Cotswolds comedy by siblings Daisy May and Charlie Cooper has been the best mockumentary since The Office. Its third and final series saw bickering bumpkin cousins Kerry and Kurtan Mucklowe capturing the banality of rural life â and viewersâ hearts with it.

The Last Dance (Netflix, April-May)  Netflix has enjoyed a docu-series hot streak, with college cheerleader series Cheer and water cooler true-crime hit Tiger King also winning acclaim this spring. Pick of the bunch was this bewitching 10-parter about the Chicago Bulls during their late Nineties pomp. You neednât be a basketball fan to savour this sporting soap opera. Packed with slow motion slam dunks, introspective interviews and power politics, itâs beautifully edited and fairly pulsates with passion.

My first stay was postponed because the new pool loungers at the refurbished spa hadnât arrived. How could I possibly go? Then, in March, there was a more significant incident involving a banana, a bat and a pig that ended up being cooked by a chef in a casino in Hong Kong, who then shook hands with a drunk Gwyneth Paltrow. Or something. My life downsized, marked solely by daily trips to M&S in Dalston, east London. Chewton Glen seemed impossibly far away.  Then, in June, I rebooked, but thanks to the machinations of government, the spa wasnât allowed to open. There were mobility scooters parked up outside my local Wetherspoons at 10am, but kundalini or a full body scrub? Hold your horses. I finally made it last week, my first foray out of London since Before Times. But, this being 2020, my husband was taken out by a stomach bug, so I went on a nice romantic trip to Hampshire alone. Still, nothing could rain on my parade, not even the actual rain falling as I was driven through the pretty rambling gardens. I could have floated through those 18th-century front doors, radiant with out-of-London joy.  Until I was face down on the table, a massage still felt implausible. I havenât been touched by anyone Iâm not married to in months. But it happened. I was rubbed in hot oil and tenderised for 75 minutes. All felt normal. And nice. The masseur wore PPE, and there were no magazines to finger in the post-treatment relaxation area, but the rest of the experience seemed comfortingly pre-plague. Notably the only touchpoint for me â massage aside â was the questionnaire I had to complete in the treatment room. No, I havenât come into contact with anyone with Covid. No, Iâm not pregnant. Am I sleeping well? Iâd say well-ish â after 10mg of Ambien and two large glasses of corner shop rioja.  The new Chewton Glen pool loungers in all their glory  The newness of the new spa is mostly in evidence around the pool. It used to be a sort of Home Counties Greco-Roman affair, now itâs gleaming white, with New Forest woodland frescoes. I spent an hour swimming, blinded by the afternoon sun pouring in, and it was everything Iâd been waiting for â frustratingly overweight thanks to lockdown bingeing, but weightless, immersed in warm water and light. In line with government guidelines, the steam rooms and saunas remained closed, facial treatments were not allowed, and you had to change in your room, but that wasnât the end of the world.  The rest of Chewton Glen is all about bringing the outside in, with a maze of red carpeted hallways in the main building, and aubergine and berry-coloured bedroom walls with an abundance of floral chintz trims and wallpaper. This is the sort of look that needs to be immaculate, executed with a lot of budget and space. The hotel has both to burn.  Dining here has changed slightly. Chef James Martin still oversees The Kitchen restaurant but it has â to use the buzzword of the year â âpivotedâ from tapas-style dishes to seafood, meaning fewer visits to the table from the staff and a more formal structure of starters and mains. The Â£50 Plateau de Fruits de Mer is an opulent arrangement of crustaceans and bivalves. I love a seafood platter â Iâm definitely never having one at home â and could eat the centrepiece of buttery brown shrimp to a band playing. Dinner at the more formal but no less prosaically named Dining Room was just as good, albeit marred by hellions and questionable parenting in a nearby private room. Plus Ã§a change. This is essentially a great grill restaurant elevated by Asian twists and fancy salads. With an eye to weight loss, a lush, simply cooked Dover sole was just the ticket.  The Hampshire hotel offers a sense of normality: reminders of 2020 are omnipresent but subtle  Chewton Glen lulled me into a false sense of normality. The reminders of 2020 are omnipresent but subtle: QR codes at tables for menus and staff in face coverings. I was shown to my room but left alone at the door, as if I was a vampire and hadnât formally invited the receptionist in. Slightly odd: Iâm sure my towels werenât straightened up by someone in a hazmat suit.  I made a misstep as I got into the vast hydrotherapy pool and hurt my left foot, shouted in blind fury, and for a split second it felt like the worst thing to have happened to me this year. Then I stood under one of those water jet things that make you feel like Bruce Weber is taking a photo of you, and felt consumed by Jeremy-Irons-in-Watchmen energy. Everything would be OK. On the way out, I noticed the new pool loungers. They were lovely: dark wood, with upholstery in a shade of blue that matched the water.

'Close pubs and shops to reopen schools', says tsar  Pubs and shops should be shut in order to reopen schools if a trade-off has to be made because of a rise in infections, the Children's Commissioner has told the Government. Anne Longfield said that if lockdown restrictions needed to be reimposed because of local Covid-19 flare-ups, schools must only be closed to bring transmission down as a last resort once all other options had been exhausted. The tsar also criticised ministers for treating children as an ""afterthought"" during lockdown. The Prime Minister has described reopening schools as a ""national priority"".

Boris Johnson announced that families and friends who have been kept apart can reunite - but they canât celebrate their reunion with hugs and kisses.  Parts of the north of England are the only exception. A partial lockdown was reinstated for Greater Manchester, Bradford, Blackburn and other areas on July 30, banning indoor meetings involving different households as coronavirus cases reached worrying levels.  Outside partial lockdown areas, the changes to measures allow two households of any size to meet indoors on the condition that they continue to observe social distancing, now reduced to one metre's distance where necessary.  People can now stay overnight at other addresses and two households are also allowed to go on holiday together in shared accommodation or neighbouring tents.  But it may be important to factor in the new and extended 10-day self isolation period the Government announced on July 30, which extends the previous seven-day quarantine period for those who have tested positive with Covid-19.  New research has suggested that symptoms could continue to appear seven-to-nine days after contracting the virus, which means transmission could be more likely when sharing a hug if its within that time frame.  Can I get coronavirus from hugging?  At the beginning of the pandemic, no one would have expected hugs to be at the top of peopleâs list of major deprivations. But after months of social distancing and isolation, loved ones are desperate to give one another a good squeeze.  Covid-19 spreads in a similar way to the flu or the common cold, in large droplets produced by coughs and sneezes, hugging, even those that last less than 10 seconds, gives the âsocial virusâ an opportunity to migrate from person to person and lives on surfaces for several hours.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/family/life/can-stay-overnight-family-friends/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml,63eef36bd8a7a086fc70f4a9de879cc2b4ef427af67bda55c3317f72e92c9dd2,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

More than 18.5 million people are known to be infected and more than 700,000 deaths have been recorded - including 46,210 in the UK.  What is a coronavirus?  Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause disease in animals. Seven, including the new virus, have made the jump to humans, but most just cause cold-like symptoms.  Covid-19 is closely related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which swept around the world in 2002 to 2003. That virus infected around 8,000 people and killed about 800 but it soon ran itself out, largely because most of those infected were seriously ill so it was easier to control.  Another coronavirus is Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), cases of which have been occurring sporadically since it first emerged in 2012 - there have been around 2,500 cases and nearly 900 deaths.  Covid-19 is different to these two other coronaviruses in that the spectrum of disease is broad, with around 80 per cent of cases leading to a mild infection. There may also be many people carrying the disease and displaying no symptoms, making it even harder to control.  So far, around 20 per cent of Covid-19 cases have been classed as ""severe"" and the current death rate varies between 0.7 per cent and 3.4 per cent depending on the location and, crucially, access to good hospital care.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/what-coronavirus-how-spread-uk-global-pandemic/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml,d30d0b118f4df90660d79446f8b2c5b661c80a92c78e7e1b3d589b4f39626d00,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Two people died when Isaias spun off a tornado that struck a North Carolina mobile home park. Another person died in Pennsylvania when their vehicle was overtaken by water and swept downstream. Two others were killed by falling trees toppled by the storm in Maryland and New York City, and a sixth person died in Delaware when a tree branch fell on them, authorities said.  Isaias sustained top winds of up to 65 miles per hour (105km/h) more than 18 hours after heading ashore, but it was down to 45mph maximum winds as of Wednesday morning (UK time), according to the National Hurricane Centre.  The storm's centre was about 45 miles southeast of Montreal, moving northeast into Canada at about 38mph.  As Isaias sped northward, the hurricane centre warned of flash flood threats in New York's Hudson River Valley and the potential for severe river flooding elsewhere in the mid-Atlantic region.

The four-time winner at Flushing Meadows does not want to travel to the United States for the event, which begins on Aug 31, while Covid-19 cases are on the rise.  A spike in coronavirus in Nadalâs Spain homeland has already led to the cancellation of next monthâs Madrid Open.  âAfter many thoughts I have Â­decided not to play this yearâs US Open,â he wrote on Instagram. âThe situation is very complicated worldwide, the Covid-19 cases are increasing, it looks like we still donât have control of it.  âI have decided to follow my heart this time and for the time Â­being I rather not travel.â  Nadal said the revamped schedule was âbarbaricâ in terms of compressing events into a short time, but he appreciated tournament Â­organisers across the world were doing their best.  Madridâs clay-court event was originally due to be played in May, but was moved to September after the first wave of Covid-19 hit Â­Europe. However, a rise in cases in Spain has meant the tournament has been cancelled until next year.  It was due to be played as the premier warm-up event for the rescheduled French Open, which is set to be played at the end of next month and plans had been put in place for a biosecure bubble to be created.  A statement from the tournament read: âAs an act of responsibility in view of the current situation caused by Covid-19, and having thoroughly evaluated the circumstances that the pandemic continues to generate, together with the competent authorities, it has been decided that the 2020 Mutua Madrid Open will not take place this year, having previously been moved to Sept 12-20.  âFollowing the strong recommendation of the local health authorities, and having monitored the situation for months, the organisers of the Mutua Madrid Open have no choice but to cancel the tournament due to the complex situation that Covid-19 continues to generate in every regard.  âIn addition, and after a spike in Covid-19 cases, the community of Madrid announced a few days ago a number of new measures to control the virusâ spread, including a directive that social gatherings are to be reduced to 10 people, both in public and private meetings, further reducing the feasibility of operating the tournament.â  The womenâs WTA Tour resumed this week with the Palermo Open, with one unidentified player pulling out on the eve of the tournament after testing positive for coronavirus, while the menâs ATP Tour will start for the first time since March on Aug 22.

And the cast list seems more than capable of living up to that billing.  Georgia Hall leads Charley Hull in the American Golf Order of Merit, with Â£20,000 going to the winner. Hall, the 2018 Womenâs Open champion overhauled her fellow Englishwoman by winning at The Shire London last Thursday.

There were two extra-time goals from Bryan that launched Fulham back into the Premier League at the expense of Brentford, here to disrupt the Championship but just one win short of the promised land. Spoiler alert: this was a terrible game, but it came alive when Bryan deceived the Brentford goalkeeper David Raya and possibly everyone else in Wembley bar his manager with a disguised free-kick that crept in at the near post in extra-time of the play-off final.  A great moment for Bryan who added a second at the end of the game - he had only scored one all season before this - just before Brentfordâs Henrik Dalsgaard claimed his sideâs only goal when it was all too late. This was a triumph for Scott Parker, the young Fulham manager who led England as captain at Wembley in 2012 and has always seemed destined to be a coach. Now he finds himself catapulted into the big league and from the midpoint of next month is up against the likes of Jurgen Klopp, Pep Guardiola, and his old team-mate Frank Lampard.  Afterwards, there was a stoic determination from the Fulham manager not to allow the emotion to carry him away as his players collectively lost it with champagne and trophy. Ever since he juggled a football as the child prodigy on the McDonalds advert there has been something very serious about Parker when it came to football and really â what a career. As a player and as a manager he has been an overachiever and although he was in situ when Fulham were relegated from the Premier League one year earlier, now he has earned his place.  There will be no glorious end to the 73-year top-flight absence of Fulhamâs west London rivals Brentford who must say goodbye to Griffin Park next season and move into their new home without a place in the Premier League. Brentford came so close but they were undone by some remarkable quick thinking by Bryan and a perfect execution.

It had been hailed as a model for tackling coronavirus. But now Germany is already contending with a second wave of the coronavirus and risks squandering its early success by flouting social distancing rules, the head of the German doctors' union has said. The number of daily confirmed cases has ticked up steadily in recent weeks, with health experts warning lax adherence to hygiene and distancing rules among some of the public is spreading the virus across communities. It follows an uptick in cases in other countries, including Spain, Belgium and Luxembourg. So could the dark days of March and April be about to return across Europe - and could the UK be next?

Giovanni Torre reveals how one of the country's state's virus strategy unravelled with sex scandals and assaults on police.  In the UK, the second wave concern is focused on schools, after a Lancet study warning that it could result in a second coronavirus wave more than twice the size of the first. Local government minister Simon Clarke said this morning that schools will reopen ""in full"" this autumn, adding: ""That is not up for debate."" Meanwhile, teaching unions have demanded an ""alternative strategy"" to reopening schools in September as they say they need official guidance on how to proceed if there is a second lockdown. Headteachers said that while they fully support the ""ambition"" to get all children back into the classroom at the start of next academic year, a ""Plan B"" is urgently needed in case this is not possible.  Tui cancels more holidays but easyJet expands flights  Europe's largest tour operator Tui has extended the cancellation of holidays to Portugal until August 17, as the country remains excluded from the Government's ""safe"" list of countries that does not require holidaymakers to quarantine on their return.

""We have witnessed the unprecedented desert locust threat to food security and livelihoods in East Africa, and we are doing everything we can to prevent a similar crisis repeating in the Sahel region, which is already experiencing several ongoing crises,"" the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said in a statement, quoted by Xinhua News Agency.  The Sahel region running south of the Sahara desert faces cyclical bouts of famine and food shortages every few years.  The region is often referred to as ground zero for global warming and suffers from widespread desertification and increasingly unpredictable rainfall.    At the same time, jihadist and armed groups fighting across Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad have displaced about a million people in the last year and disrupted the region's already fragile food supply, scaring farmers away from market places and their fields.    The pandemic and accompanying national lockdowns have made things far worse. The number of food-insecure people in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger rose by one million to 4.8 million since the start of the outbreak, according to figures released in May by the World Food Programme.    Experts fear these numbers could double or even triple as lockdown measures and a global economic downturn continue to hit the most vulnerable.  The FAO warned that the swarms of desert locusts, deemed ""the most destructive migratory pest in the world"" by the organisation, could make the situation far worse.    Billions of desert locusts have been raging across large swathes of Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Yemen since the start of the year, destroying crops.  A single swarm can contain up to 80 million locusts and eat as much food as 35,000 people and fly 30 to 80 miles in one day. The organisation said that most of the swarms in north west Kenya are expected to ride winds carrying them north to cross South Sudan into Sudan.  ""Unless it rains more in Sudan's desert, providing favourable breeding conditions for the pests, the locusts will not stay in Sudan for long and would instead move west through the Sahel of West Africa in search of food and favourable breeding areas,"" the FAO added.  The World Bank has estimated that the cost of supporting farmers and producers affected by locusts in East Africa and Yemen alone could reach $8.5bn (Â£6.5bn) by the end of 2020.    In late July, the UK International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan warned that the East African locust swarms were now growing to about 20 times what they were in March and announced that Britain would spend Â£18m to support the affected countries.

It might be worth keeping a closer eye on your furry friends, as what looks an ordinary dose of the sniffles may be something much more serious.  Pets, it seems, can catch coronavirus, too â according to the latest news from the UKâs Chief Veterinary Officer, who has confirmed the first case of Covid-19 in a British cat.  The moggy, a six-year-old Siamese from southern England, is believed to have caught the virus from its owners in May. All three have now recovered, but the cat â originally diagnosed with feline herpes â developed symptoms including shortness of breath and a runny nose.  Fewer than 50 animals worldwide have been diagnosed with coronavirus, but pet-owners up and down the country now find themselves fearing for the health of their companions.  So what symptoms should you look out for? Can dogs, horses or hamsters catch the virus? And are owners at risk if their pet gets ill?  Hereâs our expert guide to Covid-19 and your family petâ¦  Can all pets catch coronavirus, or just cats?  To date, cats (both large and small), dogs and mink have all been diagnosed with Covid-19, including four tigers and three lions at a New York zoo. All are believed to have caught the disease from humans, rather than passing it from animal to animal.  In a lab setting, ferrets and hamsters have also been shown to be susceptible. However, Dr Bruce Fogle, TV vet and author, says the chances of your pet catching Covid-19 remain âvery, very slimâ.  âIn what appear to be extraordinarily rare circumstances, someone with the virus might cough on an animal, which might then inhale it and pick up the disease,â he explains. âFerrets are more susceptible than cats and cats are more susceptible than dogs.â  There have been no known cases in horses, rabbits, mice or rats, but this doesnât mean they canât catch it. By contrast, studies have suggested that chickens and pigs arenât vulnerable to Covid-19.  Why are cats so vulnerable to the virus?  Experts had previously thought fluffy animals, such as long-haired cats and dogs, were more likely to catch the airborne droplets that carry the virus. But, in fact, the opposite is true; indeed, the British Siamese diagnosed with Covid-19 was a short-haired cat.  âThe virus survives longer on smooth, shiny surfaces than absorbent ones,â says Maggie Roberts, director of veterinary services at Cats Protection. âSo itâs not their fluffiness that makes cats more susceptible, but the fact that they groom themselves.  âWhen they groom theyâre licking their fur and anything on it, so as well as inhaling the virus they could put it in their mouths. Cats also tend to sit on peopleâs laps, often when theyâre feeling ill, so this could be another reason.â  Cats are vulnerable to several other strains of coronavirus, including feline coronavirus, which may also explain their susceptibility to Covid-19. This is due to a certain protein receptor present on their cells, which coronavirus latches on to.  What symptoms should you look out for?  Unlike in humans, Covid-19 isnât easy to spot in a pet. Indeed, says Caroline Reay, head of veterinary services at animal charity Blue Cross, the symptoms are very mild.  âThey donât get it as severely as humans â there havenât been any cases of animals dying,â she adds. âIt seems to manifest in respiratory or gastro-intestinal symptoms, but nothing more serious.â  So signs that your pet might have the virus include sniffles, a runny nose, watery eyes and stomach problems such as diarrhoea or constipation. In cats, says Maggie Roberts, these are all very similar to cat flu, a common feline virus, which can cause mild to severe attacks of sneezing.  Coughing is less common in domesticated animals. If your pet develops a new cough â or is behaving in an unusual or subdued manner â it might be worth getting them checked out.  Can cat owners catch the virus from their pets?  In short, no. âWorldwide, there has not been a single confirmed instance of someone picking up Covid-19 from a ferret, dog or cat,â says Dr Fogle.  This doesnât mean to say it couldnât happen, but of the 17 million confirmed global cases of coronavirus, not one has been transmitted from an animal to a human.  Can pets spread coronavirus even if they don't get ill?  In theory, pets can act as âfomitesâ â infection-carrying surfaces â and so even if they donât catch coronavirus, they may still spread it around your house.  âThe virus could be on their fur in the same way it is on other surfaces, such as tables and doorknobs,â explains Daniella Dos Santos, president of the British Veterinary Association.  If they come into contact with a human who has Covid-19, a pet may carry the virus around on their fur, paws, tail or face â and could therefore infect other humans who stroke, hold or feed them. The droplets could live on their bodies for up to 72 hours.  Can they spread it to other animals?  A limited study carried out in China, in which animals were exposed to high doses of the virus, suggested that cats and ferrets could transmit it to other animals when in close contact.  But there is no evidence of this happening outside a lab setting, so if you suspect one pet has coronavirus, thereâs no need to quarantine it away from other animals in the house.  Itâs good practice to keep food bowls, litter trays and sleeping areas separate anyway, where possible, and ensure you wash your hands thoroughly before and after handling each pet.  Does it affect animals the same way as humans?  Petsâ symptoms appear to be much milder, and there is no evidence that there is a risk to their life.  They also recover from the virus faster â typically within a couple of days, rather than a matter of weeks â and there is no evidence of long-term damage to their respiratory systems.  Dogs, although able to catch the virus, appear to be completely asymptomatic â much like babies and young children.  If you think your pet has coronavirus, what should you do?  Experts donât advise rushing to the vet, no matter how worried you might be. âAll conversations with vets these days should start with a phone call; donât just turn up at the practice,â says Caroline Reay.  This isnât just because of the risk of spreading infection, but because there are certain protocols to follow when an animal has a suspected case of the virus.  âThere is a very specific test looking for Covid-19 in cats,â Caroline explains. âThe vet will have to order this in, youâll have to pay â and the results wonât be instantaneous.â  If a sick animal is content in the house, the best advice is to keep it indoors until it can be tested.  What precautions should you take?  Whether you suspect your pet has Covid-19, have suspected or confirmed Covid-19 yourself, or are simply worried about either of you catching it, hand hygiene is the recommended course of action.  Use soap and water, or alcohol-based gel if youâre not at home, and wash hands for 20 seconds before and after every contact with your pet: feeding them, grooming them or petting them.  Donât let animals lick your face or kiss them on the mouth, donât share food with them and donât let them share your bed or lie on sofas or chairs youâll also be using. Taking them for walks is advised, not discouraged, unless they have a confirmed diagnosis, but always keep to the two-metre social distancing rule (from other humans and animals, if possible).  Maggie Roberts says you should discourage other peopleâs pets from coming into your house and, if you have Covid-19 yourself, ask a friend, neighbour or family member to look after your pet. Dr Fogle recommends brushing your dog down after it has been outdoors, using a wet sponge.  If you own a horse, disinfecting shared equipment at stables and yards is especially important. âWe recommend horse owners write down their horseâs current routine and if any changes are made notify the yard owner,â adds Emmeline Hannelly of the British Horse Society.  Should you buy your pet a facemask?  While wearing facemasks around pets is encouraged â although it may take some getting used to â experts strongly advise against fitting your furry friend with a face covering of their own.  Dog-owners in China have been snapping up canine respiratory masks for pooches, but animal welfare commentators say theyâre not only ineffective but can be cruel.  âWe wear masks to stop us from spreading the virus, not to protect us, so there would be no need to fit one on a pet,â says Maggie Roberts. âIt would be quite distressing for them, and they simply wouldnât tolerate it.â",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/pets/news-features/cats-catch-coronavirus-dogs-spread-carry-covid-19-advice-animals/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml,3df566cd7db5cd12201053eeaeb6ee501a1701be9fe38a0a07177921b7a0b4a3,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

As the coronavirus pandemic spread across the world in early 2020 and pressure mounted on the International Olympic Committee, a decision was finally made on March 24, 2020, to postpone the Tokyo Games - the first time since the Second World War they had been moved or delayed.  Over the course of the preceding days and weeks, it had become apparent that a Tokyo Olympics in their original July/August 2020 dates was not feasible. Not only was sport grinding to a halt, but social distancing measures were being employed around the world and severe restrictions on international movement meant the decision was effectively taken out of the IOCâs hands.  A number of different dates were informally proposed for the rearranged 2021 Games, but the new schedule was confirmed a week after the initial postponement: Olympics on July 23 to August 8 and Paralympics on August 24 to September 5.  What are the financial implications?  The financial considerations of a postponed Olympics are astronomical. Experts have suggested the costs to Japan will be about Â£5billion, while the IOC is known to have insurance cover, underwritten by Lloydâs of London.  From a British perspective, the pandemic and 12-month delay meant two major funding concerns: sports at serious risk of collapse due to total lack of revenue streams, and the continuation of the high-performance system that funds elite Olympic medal contenders.  Speaking to the Government in early May, Katherine Grainger, chair of UK Sport - which dishes out funding to Olympic and Paralympic sports - said the organisation needed an extra Â£53m in a bid to stave off having to make potentially âquite disastrousâ decisions ahead of the rearranged Tokyo Games.  Of most immediate concern to elite athletes is the direct investment in high-performance sport, which totals Â£345m and works on a four-year cycle - in line with the Olympic/Paralympic cycle. With the Tokyo cycle initially planned to last only until March 2021, UK Sport made an âexceptionalâ funding request to extend the cycle by one extra year, to be mitigated by a reduced three-year cycle to the Paris Games in 2024.  âUnless we know that [gap] is going to be filled, the risks increase for everyone,â said Grainger. âSports have already taken as many decisions as they can to minimise loss. If we can give them reassurance that the long-term funding is in place, they will not make decisions that really could be quite disastrous. We want to give some long-term planning certainty.â  At the start of July, the Government then provided assurances that funding levels would be extended for another year, with Oliver Dowden, the Culture Secretary, promising to âensure necessary fundingâ was available during the Treasuryâs Autumn review of all spending.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/olympics/0/tokyo-olympics-2020-2021-date-when-postponed-next-year/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml,5ecb84c93a57e1480f603d3506e651ce2f3d35f7040dd17ae090a7f92b05ef01,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

To ensure staff and shoppers are kept safe, a host of guidelines have been put in place, which include maintaining social distancing, excellent hygiene levels and mandatory PPE where applicable. As such, face coverings are now compulsory in shops, enclosed spaces and on public transport.  For those who wear glasses however, wearing a face mask presents a niggly issue: steaming. If youâre accustomed to wearing specs regularly, youâll know all too well how annoying it is to have them fog up from condensation while sipping a morning coffee or cooking over a hot stove, and face masks, sadly, will likely have that same effect.  When we wear a mask, our warm breath escapes out of the top of the fabric around your nose, and so landing on the cooler lens of your glasses creating condensation, and therefore, the dreaded fog. Youâll be pleased to note that there are a few ways to avoid it...  What should I look for in a mask?  The fit is everything when it comes to preventing steaming glasses. As well as this, even if your mask is medical-grade and made up of the best materials that filter air particles for the most effective protection, if the fit isnât snug enough, the mask is redundant.  Look for masks with a fine wire over the nose bridge to ensure it sits flush against your skin. Adjustable straps that can be tightened to smooth out any gaps are ideal, as is a mask with elastic along the bottom under the chin, too.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/how-wear-face-mask-glasses-same-time-stop-steaming-up/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml,9aaab4f75a2b6b7ca05e44ed51dc7973390ce5fcbc4516014f14051548a77d10,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The US tech titan will buy 16pc of Deliveroo, pumping in $575m (Â£400m) of vital cash to help it stay afloat. Monopoly regulators cleared the deal after a lengthy investigation found it would not substantially decrease competition in the market.  Officials at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced they were looking into the funding round last summer. They launched an investigation in December amid concerns it could reduce the number of players in the online food delivery and grocery market, ultimately driving up prices for consumers.  However, in April the CMA said it would provisionally clear the agreement because Deliveroo had warned it desperately needed cash to stave off collapse during the coronavirus pandemic.  The CMA then issued a further finding in June, saying that the two sides would not be required to offer up any remedies - pledges aimed at supporting competition, such as an agreement to sell parts of a business - as Amazon was only buying a minority stake.  This caused anger among some insiders who believed the CMA should have reached this decision much sooner given that the size of Amazon's planned investment had been known a year earlier.  Regulators' final report said that internal documents from Amazon and Deliveroo shareholders suggested they had viewed the deal as a âpotential first step toward a full acquisitionâ.  Stuart McIntosh, who led the watchdog's inquiry, added: âIf [Amazon] were to increase its shareholding in Deliveroo, that could trigger a further investigation by the CMA.â  A Deliveroo spokesman said: âWe are delighted that the CMA has concluded its 15 month investigation and that the Amazon minority investment can now go ahead.â  The company added that 30,000 new restaurants have joined its food delivery app so far this year, with a jump in demand as restaurants were forced to focus on deliveries during lockdown.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/08/04/amazons-stake-deliveroo-cleared-competition-watchdog/,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rss.xml,c08b164cd78e053c487d4abf396ba86b7162c864ead655934306df113d311655,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

However, the true horror exposed by Herseyâs reporting, which ran to 30,000 words and spanned an entire issue of the magazine, lay not in numbers but in a narrative which tracked the experiences of six atomic bomb survivors.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  By tracing the steps and sights of two doctors, two priests, a clerk and a widow with young children, he gave a human face to the cityâs suffering in the aftermath of the explosion.  Soon after the US occupation of Japan ended in 1952, the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, known collectively as the hibakusha, started to publicly speak out about their experiences.  Seventy-five years on from the detonation of the two atomic bombs, hibakusha continue to campaign for nuclear disarmament through their first-hand testimony.  Howard Kakita, who was born in the US in 1938 and was at his grandparentsâ home in Hiroshima on the fateful date of 6 August, 1945, is one of them.  Despite being very close to ground zero, he, his older brother Kenny and his grandparents survived.  Aged seven at the time, he vividly recalls seeing a stream of people with terrible injuries and corpses lining the road, as his family made their way to the train station to leave the devastated city.  Like many others, he and his brother went bald and grew sick soon afterwards, probably as a result of radiation poisoning.

Log in to update your newsletter preferences Register with your social account or click here to log in I would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email Update newsletter preferences  Speaking all these years later, Mr Kakita says the memories of the hibakusha âsend a powerful message to the leaders of the world to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and ban nuclear warfare altogetherâ.  A history of campaigning  The hibakushaâs campaigning work started in earnest in the 1950s, with the foundation of Nihon Hidankyo, a nationwide organisation of A-bomb survivors, in 1956.  Before that, those who had been at Hiroshima and Nagasaki suffered discrimination.  Bo Jacobs, a social historian of nuclear technologies at the Hiroshima Peace Institute, told The Independent: âAfter the occupation ended in 1952, the hibakusha were pretty hidden away. It was a period of real discrimination against them.  âThere was not much public activity in which they were involved in any shape or form until 1954,â he added.  Among other obstacles, the survivors often found it hard to get a job or marry because of other peopleâs concerns about their health and the health of their future children.  The survivorsâ movement, which gave them a voice, was galvanised by the USâs testing of a hydrogen bomb in the south Pacific on 1 March 1954, according to Mr Jacobs.  Carried out on the Marshall Islands, the âCastle Bravoâ test resulted in the hospitalisation of the crew of The Lucky Dragon, a Japanese ship that was coated in radioactive ash from the bombâs fallout.  Like thousands of survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki, one crew member died six months later due to his exposure to radiation.  In the decades after the survivorsâ movement took off, hibakusha travelled widely around the globe to speak about what they had witnessed.  Mr Jacobs explained: âThereâs always been this story in Hiroshima and Nagasaki that the act of witnessing and testimony will compel nuclear abolition.  âSo if the world would understand what had happened - hear the stories of the hibakusha - then everyone would be against nuclear weapons.â  Recent success  The advocacy work undertaken by survivors living in Japan and elsewhere has had tangible results in recent years, with the arrival of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) in 2017.  Tim Wright, who works as the treaty coordinator of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), told The Independent that the hibakusha played a large role in getting the treaty passed.  Survivors spoke at several international conferences in 2013 and 2014 on the humanitarian implications of nuclear attacks, as well as during the TPNW negotiations.  Speaking from Melbourne, Australia, Mr Wright said: âTheir testimonies have been very important in changing the entire narrative about nuclear weapons.  âFor a long time the focus was on abstract concepts such as deterrents and strategic stability and so on. And that really obscures the reality of what these weapons are.  âThe hibakusha have for decades warned that if we keep these weapons, one day theyâll be used again and the consequences will be utterly catastrophic.â  Survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki have long been part of ICAN, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2017 for its work to eliminate nuclear arms.  In fact, Setsuko Thurlow, a hibakusha, was one of the people who collected the prize in Oslo on the groupâs behalf.  Speaking about the advocacy work of survivors at the awards ceremony, she said: âWe rose up. We shared our stories of survival. We said: humanity and nuclear weapons cannot coexist.â  Now, more than 40 countries have ratified the treaty, which will come into effect after 50 states have signed it.  Writing in The Irish Times on Hiroshima Day, Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign affairs minister, confirmed that his country would be the latest to ratify the treaty.  Two further countries could follow suit later on Thursday, according to ICAN.  This comes after a report from ICAN which suggests that the nine nuclear-armed nations spent more money on such arms last year than at any other time since the height of the cold war.  The modernisation of nuclear warheads continues, with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) estimating that there are still 13,000 nuclear weapons in the world. The US and Russia have 12,175 between them.  Despite the challenges ahead regarding disarmament, the hibakusha still believe the world can right itself.  Mr Kakita, who witnessed the bombing of Hiroshima as a seven-year-old boy, said: âIt is our hope that in the future there will be no events such as we experienced at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  âAnd itâs also our hope that no one in the world will be designated as a hibakusha.â",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/hiroshima-atomic-bomb-75th-anniversary-survivors-a9657126.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,2e1c9951fff0c8970fa6069a58e19aeddb66fc1a4ca40b64bb683862930ee9dd,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

New data from Englandâs test and trace service shows the rise in positive cases comes despite the number of people overall being tested rising just four per cent.

France, as our closest neighbour barring Ireland, makes sense for a first international sojourn.  But can British holidaymakers get there? And will we be welcome if we go?  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Hereâs everything you need to know.  Am I allowed to travel to France from the UK?  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) issued a blanket warning against all non-essential international travel in March, but this has now been lifted for more than 80 destinations.  France was on this list, meaning Britons can now visit there without invalidating their travel insurance.  How could I get there?  There are several ways of hopping the Channel. The most obvious one is the Eurostar, which has continued to up its capacity, with six daily services now running from London St Pancras to Paris Gare du Nord.  The Eurotunnel is open for you to drive from Folkestone to Calais, subject to the completion of an online form and health declaration.  P&O Ferries is operating five daily sailings between Dover and Calais.  Flying is also a possibility â although fares may be steep.  Will they let me in when I arrive?  Yes â border restrictions which limited travel between the UK and France to âessential reasons onlyâ have now been lifted.  Itâs no longer necessary to complete the International Travel Certificate to enter mainland France. As long as you donât have any coronavirus symptoms, there should be nothing stopping you from being permitted entry.  Will I have to quarantine when I arrive?  No. France previously required Brits to undergo a two-week quarantine (though it was somewhat voluntary in nature), but has lifted this measure since the UK did likewise for travellers entering the country from France.

Can I travel within France?  Yes. On 2 June, the ban on people travelling more than 100km from their homes in France was lifted.  People no longer need to present an official declaration for exceptional travel to move around the country.  Are hotels open?  Yes: campsites and hotels were given the green light to reopen earlier in June.  Are restaurants, shops and attractions open?  Since 11 May, lockdown measures have been gradually relaxed in France, but vary from region to region depending on the infection rate. Stricter rules will apply in departments where the virus is more active (red and orange zones) than in departments where there is less cause for concern (green zones). However, at present, all regions have been given green status.  Most shops and open-air markets are now open in France, with health measures in place. You must wear a mask if the shopkeeper requires it.  Theatres, entertainment venues, leisure parks, gyms, swimming pools and sports centres have been able to reopen from June.  Bars and restaurants reopened from 2 June, with âadapted health measuresâ.  Public spaces such as parks, gardens, beaches and lakes are open across France, unless itâs not possible to apply social distancing measures.  Cinemas reopened across France from 22 June.  Major attractions have also been permitted to reopen â the Palace of Versailles reopened on 6 June, while the Centre Pompidou and the Louvre opened on 1 and 6 July respectively.  What rules are in place?  Franceâs Health Minister has announced that wearing masks in enclosed public spaces are compulsory from Monday 20 July for those aged 11 and over.  Public spaces include: public conference and meeting rooms; cinemas, theatre and enclosed entertainment venues; restaurants and bars (including those at altitude); hotels and shared holiday properties (including those at altitude); mountain huts/cabins; education and training establishments; games rooms, leisure centres and holiday parks; libraries and archives; places of worship; indoor sporting venues such as gyms (except for while participating in sporting activity), and some other open-air venues; museums; marquees and tents; public boats (including moored quayside bars/venues); train and bus stations; shops and shopping centres; administrative buildings and banks; and covered markets.  Face coverings are also mandatory on public transport and in taxis without a plexiglass screen, with fines issued to those who do not comply.  Social distancing has been implemented in many places.  Will I have to quarantine when I come home?  Not anymore.  Although the government implemented a blanket two-week quarantine for all inbound arrivals on 8 June, from 10 July this was lifted for certain countries.  Places regarded as âlow-riskâ by the Joint Biosecurity Centre â which was set up to coordinate the governmentâs response to the pandemic â are now exempt from mandatory self-isolation.

The latest example of the liberal surge came this week in a primary race in Missouri, where Cori Bush, a 44-year-old Black Lives Matter activist, defeated Representative William Lacy Clay Jr, 64, the heir to a St Louis political dynasty, for a reliably Democratic House seat.  Ms Bush is the fifth left-wing Democrat to oust an incumbent member of congress from her party since the start of Trump's presidency â including three this year â and her victory came as a welcome jolt for liberal activists working to challenge entrenched Democrats. A constellation of liberal organisations that helped push Ms Bush to victory are now turning their focus on defeating other establishment figures, such as Representative Richard Neal, D-Mass., the powerful chair of the House Ways and Means Committee.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  In another race in Michigan on Tuesday, Representative Rashida Tlaib easily fended off a primary challenger for her Detroit House seat â virtually ensuring her return to congress as a member of the self-described âsquadâ of younger minority female House Democrats seeking to push the party's policies to the left.  âThey counted us out,â Ms Bush told supporters Tuesday night at her St Louis campaign office. âThey called me â I'm just the protester, I'm just the activist with no name, no title and no real money. That's all they said that I was. But St Louis showed up today.â  The insurgents and establishment figures disagree over the impact of these races, some dismissing the anti-establishment wins as unique to each campaign. But both sides agree that this movement feeds off victories, boosting fundraising for a slew of relatively new liberal PACs, and that losses would have starved them of political oxygen.  Veteran Democrats see this as the natural outgrowth of a wave of protests that started the day after Mr Trump was sworn into office.  âThis is all a reaction to Donald Trump. Some took to the streets, others took to the campaign trail,â said Steve Israel, a former Democratic congressman from Long Island who remains close with his former colleagues.  Along with victories in other open-seat primaries earlier this year, liberals will have a larger presence inside the House Democratic Caucus next year. This could give them a broader platform to push the potential Biden administration and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, to embrace their more aggressive agenda on health care and climate issues.  But Ms Pelosi's allies noted that she has had a stronger grip on her caucus in her second stint as speaker than she did a decade ago, and she has so far not faced the problems that drove John Boehner, R-Ohio, out as speaker in 2015 when conservative firebrands demanded his ouster.

In the summer of 2018, Hispanic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, and black Representative Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass, defeated a pair of white incumbents with more than 40 years combined tenure in districts that had quickly diversified.  Representatives Dan Lipinski, D-Ill, and Eliot Engel, D-NY, lost to insurgent primary challengers in March and July, respectively, but Ms Bush's win this week served as a breakthrough for a movement that previously lost badly when it challenged members of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC).  Mr Clay Jr's grandfather had served as a St. Louis alderman and his father, William âBillâ Clay, served 32 years in the same congressional seat, co-founding the CBC, before turning over the seat to his son in 2001.  âCori Bush took down a [political] dynasty on her 2nd try,â tweeted Kayla Reed, the executive director of Action St. Louis, a group that grew out of the Ferguson protests in 2014. âShe ended a 50 year stronghold. Do you understand what that means? The entire black [political] establishment cameâ after her, Ms Reed said. âAnd she put them in the ground.â  House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md, who has brushed aside similar primary challenges on his left, chalked up Ms Bush's victory to unique circumstances surrounding her own campaign.  âI don't think there's any big message,â Mr Hoyer said Wednesday on NPR.

2020-08-06 13:19:49.660104,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 10:39:00 GMT",Coronavirus: Number of families hit by benefit cap doubles in three months during pandemic,"The number of families having their incomes cut by the government's benefit cap doubled in just three months during the first wave of coronavirus, official statistics show.  As of May 2020 150,000 households had their social security payments capped by the policy, a 93 per cent increase from the previous quarter.  There was also a 500 per cent increase in new households being hit by the cap for the first time â suggesting many people are feeling its sting for the first time.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  The policy leaves families unable to pay their rent, with 2018 research showing two thirds covered for six months or more go into arrears with their landlords. It also disproportionately affects ill and disabled people.  The government claims the benefit cap is an incentive to work, but unemployment is set to rocket in the aftermath of the pandemic as businesses shutter or scale back staffing to cope with lockdown, social distancing regulations, and economic recession.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak has now begun to unwind his furlough scheme and transfer costs of supporting laid-off workers onto employers, with the new state support set to disappear entirely in the autumn.  Jon Sparkes, chief executive at homelessness charity Crisis, said the cap needed to be immediately suspended to prevent a wave of homelessness.  âWith each passing day comes new job losses as the impact of the pandemic is felt. These figures show thousands of people are turning to the benefits system to break their fall, only to discover that the benefit cap is cutting them off from vital support,"" he warned.  âDespite ongoing assurances that the benefit cap grace period would protect people newly claiming, we know that people on low incomes arenât getting this support, which is leaving many worrying about how they are going to pay their rent or put food on the table for their children.  âIf we are to avoid a wave of people from losing their homes through no fault of their own, itâs vital that the government immediately suspends the benefit cap so that people have the means to stay afloat. Otherwise we risk all the good work to protect people being undone.â  Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In a pandemic it is egregious. People whoâve lost earnings or jobs because of Covid-19 are finding that theyâve also lost significant amounts of their social security support because of the cap. That isnât right. The cap is causing intense hardship yet in the pandemic most routes for escaping it are closed off so families are left without a life raft.  We should not be further impoverishing vulnerable children because their parents live in high rent areas and for very real and practical reasons are unable to work more hours or move house Alison Garnham, Child Poverty Action Group  âThe cap hits hardest the very families who are least able to avoid it â single parents with very young kids who even in normal times canât just get a new job , increase their working hours or up sticks to cheaper housing â precisely because they are caring for very young children. In a pandemic their chances of escaping the cap are extremely limited or non-existent.  âParents on low wages have no wriggle room â if they receive universal credit and earn less than Â£604 a month theyâre capped but if they earn more than Â£616 they lose free school meals. Itâs a terrible poverty trap. The cap should be lifted so that every parent can meet their childrenâs needs in the pandemic and beyond it.  âWe should not be further impoverishing vulnerable children because their parents live in high rent areas and for very real and practical reasons are unable to work more hours or move house to escape the cap.â  The average amount of money lost from the cap Â£58 per week. Of all households capped, 87 per cent (133,000) are families, and 62 per cent are single parent families.  The cap is Â£13,400 a year for single adults outside Greater London and Â£15,410 a year inside London. The corresponding figures for families are Â£20,000 and Â£23,000. Most households who hit the cap do so because of housing benefit, which is often paid directly to landlords.  Seema Malhotra, Labourâs Shadow Employment Minister, said ending the cap would help the poorest families in the country.  âThese figures must serve as a wakeup call to the Government. Labour has repeatedly called on the Government to scrap the benefit cap to avoid the picture we are seeing today,"" she said.  âThis is a policy that is pushing children and families into poverty. With around eight job seekers for every vacancy, rising to 20 per vacancy in some parts of the country, this is a Government totally out of touch with the reality of peopleâs lives.

""We need to seize this moment to fix the broken welfare system and introduce a Universal Basic Income so no-one is left behind.""

So his staff planned a pick-me-up in his home state,"The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a contribution.  Donald Trump needed a pick-me-up. He got it Friday afternoon in his new home state, Florida.  He was slated to go straight from Air Force One at Tampa International Airport to a ""campaign coalitions"" event with Sunshine State sheriffs. But as the executive jet neared the west Florida landing strip, reporters tweeted photos and video of the scene: a presidential lectern was set up along with loud speakers opposite hundreds of Trump-gear-clad supporters.  What unfolded was some sunshine-soaked political Prozac for a commander in chief who spent most of the week noticeably downtrodden â even sounding rather sad.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Mr Trump seemed perplexed, frustrated and blue on Tuesday night as he all but pleaded with reporters to believe his contention that he gets along well with Anthony Fauci, the top federal infectious disease official. He also claimed, despite the two countless times since the Covid-19 outbreak hit in March contradicting each other, he agrees with much of what Mr Fauci says.  ""It's interesting: he's got a very good approval rating. And I like that, it's good,""Mr Trump said. ""Because remember: He's working for this administration. He's working with us. We could have gotten other people. We could have gotten somebody else. It didn't have to be Dr Fauci. He's working with our administration. And for the most part we've done what he and others, and Dr [Deborah] Birx and others, have recommended.""  ""And he's got this high approval rating. So why don't I have a high approval rating with respect ... to the virus?"" Mr Trump asked rhetorically, adding he ""should have it very high"".  He called it ""curious that ""Dr Fauci and Dr Birx also, very highly thought of, and yet, they're highly thought of, but nobody likes me?"" a shocked and sad president said.  His conclusion, amid low poll numbers across the board and deficits against former Vice President Joe Biden in just about every 2020 swing state? ""It can only be my personality, that's all,"" he said.  The president seemed running in a lower gear â by his frenetic standards, that is â all week.  His revived coronavirus briefings this week mostly lacked the controversy and razzle-dazzle that characterised them during the early weeks and months of the outbreak. He seemed a bit lethargic during a Thursday roundtable at Red Cross headquarters here.  'It will be rigged'  The president appeared more energetic, but visibility angry on Friday morning when he met with law enforcement officials in the Cabinet Room. He railed against Democratic leaders over stalled Covid-19 relief legislation. And his face grew red as he predicted November's election may never end, too marred in uncertainty by what he calls a crush of fraudulent ballots â then ones showing up to be counted well after 3 November.  ""You'll see what happens. It's common sense. Everyone knows mail-in ballots are a disaster. You just have to take a look at the last recent, take a look at New York City. Look at New York. They are still counting your ballots,"" he said. ""They had a race, small race by comparison. By comparison, tiny. It's so messed up they have no idea. There are ballots missing. Thousands and thousands of ballots are missing.  ""They think they're going to send hundreds of millions of ballots all over the United States and it's going to come out [okay],"" he said, before morphing into an agitated Trump-stradamus: ""You won't know the election results for weeks, months, maybe years after. Maybe you'll never know the election results, and that's what I'm concerned with.""  In a statement that revealed a lot about his assessment of how his re-election bid is going, Mr Trump then added the money quote: ""It will be fixed, it will be rigged. People ought to get smart.""  In short, this did not look nor sound like a president who was enjoying himself this week. Until he got to Tampa, that is.  Using both Air Force One and ""The Beast,"" his heavily armoured Cadillac limousine as a background few would refuse to label as cool and politically effective â the spoils of incumbency â he instantly looked and sounded like himself again.  He lambasted ""Crazy Bernie"" Sanders and ""Pocahontas,"" his derisive nickname for progressive Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. When he brought up Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, he sarcastically called her ""a beauty,"" referring to her very liberal policy views.  Mr Trump contended the 77-year-old Mr Biden, just three years his senior, has lost a step mentally, saying the former VP is unaware what's happening at any given moment.  When his own rhetorical cues took him to Minnesota Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, a supporter yelled something that caused even Mr Trump to resist. ""You're going to get me in trouble,"" he said, referring vaguely to his past comments about her that many deemed racist.  'Polls are going up, up, up'  He was just getting started, seemingly recharged by the crowd and the Florida sun.  ""They want to defund the police,"" he alleged of Democrats, saying falsely one more time that doing just that is in ""Bernie and Biden's manifesto."" Their joint policy document, however, calls for increasing police funding, but making some reforms to how America's departments do their business and interact with civilians.  He sang his own hits like a rock star on stage for the first time in months.  ""I'm protecting your Second Amendment, he roared to more cheers. ""Biden supports lethal sanctuary cities....Biden opposes the death penalty.""  Mr Trump then slammed Democrats, including his presumptive general election foe over what he called their shared ""anti-police agenda"" before promising that as long as he is in power he will ""ensure cop killers receive the death penalty"" â even though that's up to states.  Like at those rallies that have been paused after the poorly attended one in Tulsa, Oklahoma, due to coronavirus concerns, Mr Trump boldly predicted victory in the fall -- despite trailing Mr Biden by nearly 7 points in some crucial swing states and by 7.8 points nationally in the RealClearPolitics average of a handful of surveys.  ""Those polls are going up, up, up,"" he declared.  The statement defied reality and data. But when has either ever been on the marquee at a Trump rally? More importantly for Mr Trump's campaign team and re-election chances, it was delivered with his signature showman's gusto.",https://www.independent.co.uk/us-election-2020/donald-trump-florida-minirally-supporters-a9649131.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,834f379c1bb548e802f53a201ee5813a2f2ac14fc6f336e12c65663169a5a8eb,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

To support us, please consider a contribution.  Seven Sisters Indoor Market typically throngs with Colombian restaurants, shops and beauty salons, narrated by shouts of Spanish and salsa beats. But after other indoor markets reopened on 15 June, Tottenhamâs âLatin Villageâ remains under lockdown.  On Thursday night, dozens of people gathered outside the north London market to protest its continued closure and long-term proposals to replace it with a modern retail centre.  Clad in masks, gloves and Colombian football shirts, protesters sang the Colombian national anthem, chanted âSave Latin Villageâ and listened to speeches calling for an end to âgentrificationâ and âsocial cleansingâ.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  The indoor market is home to 60 small businesses and employs over 100 locals, mostly of Latin American descent. The site fell into disrepair under previous manager Market Asset Management (MAM), which declared insolvency in June. Transport for London, the siteâs landlord, took over the lease on 7 July and announced health and safety repairs to gas and electricity systems, telling traders the market will not reopen before October.  The closure is the latest in a long-running dispute over the site. In 2004, Haringey Council agreed plans with property developer Grainger to redevelop the site into a modern retail centre. But, through over a decade of campaigning and legal battles, including a human rights case at the United Nations, market traders won several protections.  All current traders will relocate to a temporary site opposite the current market when construction begins, and move back to the site once it finishes. Traders will have a three-month rent-free period in the temporary market and licence fee protections at the new site.  But campaigners say the Latin Villageâs unique character will be lost. They also say the âmanaged declineâ of the site by MAM amounted to âracial discriminationâ, and that TfL could have stepped in earlier.  Mirca Morera, who founded the Save Latin Village campaign, told the crowd: âTfL have known about the problems here for years. Like Grenfell, a Bame community complained for years and years and it falls on deaf ears. Why? Because weâre considered less important.â  Victoria Alvarez, the chair of the Seven Sisters market tenant association, told The Independent: âWe have been displaced many times because the majority of the traders are refugees. And you feel like youâre going to be displaced again.â  The campaigners have developed an alternative community plan, through which traders would remain on-site during building works and rent prices would not go up. But protesters have tried and failed to challenge the contract to sell the market building from TfL to Grainger.

He said: âThe story behind both is the same: so-called âgentrificationâ is happening to a community that established itself 20 to 25 years ago.â  Criticising Haringey council and Sadiq Khan, he added: âWe need to keep campaigning because no one is going to do it for us.â  Protesters told The Independent about the emotional connection they feel to a place they call the âPueblito Paisaâ. Jose Andres, whose wife is a hairdresser in the market, said: âWeâre far from home, but here we have a little corner to ourselves.â Dressed in a Colombian football shirt and a traditional sombrero, he said: âThis place stops us losing that Latin warmth, that sense of family and our customs.â  Carlos Burgos, an elderly Salvadorian who arrived in 1976 and spends most of his time at the market, said through his protective mask: âItâs a symbol to tell our children and grandchildren about our culture. We donât need this. Weâve been saying so for 13 years.â  Alvarez has been a market trader for 18 years and runs a beauty salon and money transfer business. She said the pandemic and the uncertainty over the siteâs future have left some traders suffering from mental health difficulties. Javie Huxley, a trustee of the Save Latin Village campaign and protest organiser, told the crowd: âKnowing that my community hub is going to be closed has been a really heartbreaking thing to come to terms with over this time.â  However, not all of the traders agreed with the protest. Marta Hinestroza, the director of the Pueblito Paisa Community Centre, worked on early campaigns but she did not attend last night.  Hinestroza, a former human rights lawyer in Colombia, said: âWe had a really tough battle and, though we didnât win, we managed to make them change the terms of the agreement. This was a great achievement because we came from nothing.â  Itâs a symbol to tell our children and grandchildren about our culture. We donât need this. Weâve been saying so for 13 years Carlos Burgos  While the Seven Sisters Market Tenant Association says 60 per cent of traders back the campaign, Hinestroza claims the figure is less than half and is optimistic that the market will survive under the plans: âItâs a challenge but the conditions are there for us to come out on top and be stronger.â  Her desire to pay the campaignersâ barristers and lawyers led to disagreements with other campaigners. She was âexcludedâ from Whatsapp groups and felt âisolatedâ from others, she said.  In appointments to the tenantsâ association this week, supporters and opponents of the redevelopment will have equal representation. Chan Seenandan, a Guyanese woman, has been working in the market since 1991. She said: âI donât mind going over to the other side.

Weâre all losing out, regardless of which side you are on.â  Hinestroza has also lobbied TfL this week to address the âabandonmentâ the site was left in. In a letter seen by The Independent, she and other traders asked TfL for appropriate compensation for the four months of lost income that the closure will entail and a timetable for the repairs, calling the amount of time for repairs âexcessiveâ.  A spokesperson for TfL said the traders will receive the same support as small business tenants across London.  In a statement, Graeme Craig, director of commercial development at TfL, said: âSince 7 July, we have been working to address the outstanding health and safety issues to enable the market to reopen at the earliest opportunity. The market is an important local asset and we are keen to see it reopen and thriving when it is safe for customers and traders to do so. We are in regular communication with the traders to offer information and support.â",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/latin-village-seven-sisters-indoor-market-london-colombia-elephant-castle-a9637001.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,612ee5dc5e2e887138d9660a013a9527ec618d3a4a3a30c11113f1b8f8cbbe5c,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:19:51.861468,"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 10:22:00 GMT",Pitch perfect: Last Chance U is the most honest portrayal yet of sporting hopefuls,"Last Chance U: Laney opens in a nursery. A mountain of soft toys stands in one corner and an overhead night-light throws rainbow colours across a sleeping babyâs face. Itâs not until several scenes in that we even see a football field. For the players of the Oakland Eagles, their world doesnât solely revolve around sport. That kind of privileged one-track mind does not â cannot â exist in the world of junior college football weâre watching. Here, the game is not only a passion but a potential meal ticket, a means of escaping an abusive family, or a financial lifeline to support their children when they are barely adults themselves.  Across four seasons, Netflix docuseries Last Chance U has made a name for itself by providing outsiders with a direct line into the insular realm of college football. The Emmy-nominated show became just as popular among those familiar with the appeal of the pigskin as those who werenât. Some of its success can be attributed to its deft narrative creation and expertly edited footage of game play. Mostly itâs because director Greg Whitley makes it clear from the outset that sport is only part of the parcel. That message is louder than ever in its final season â before the series turns its lens to basketballâs high-flyers next year â where match-winning touchdowns are overshadowed by powerful emotional displays.  Using sports as a device to tell other, more intractable stories about class or race isnât new: think Coach Carter, A League of Their Own or Bend it Like Beckham. Previous seasons of Last Chance U do it well, parsing broader themes through bingeable episodes of sporting triumphs and defeats. But by moving to Oakland, California, this showâs fifth season does it even better; it documents the Laney College Eagles as they enter a new season to defend their title as California state football champions. But the series takes a step back from the sporting action to delve more deeply into the plays happening off the field.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  JuCo football has always had the makings of good television. Itâs a last chance for young hopefuls who want to play at a higher level. Many of the players are Division 1 stars who have been booted out of their student-athlete programmes due to infractions like bad grades, drug use or skipping school. For them, JuCo is a shot at redemption. In this respect, the show follows a narrative that will be familiar to fans of past seasons: a cast of young, mostly Black athletes, who often come from childhoods of poverty and trauma, take a final Hail Mary pass at locking down a scholarship. Often itâs their one way out of bleak circumstances. By design, the stakes are high. But at Laney, where inner-city violence, racial tensions and increasingly unaffordable rent are monstrous obstacles, they are higher still.  Past seasons of the show were set on rural campuses where player prospects were similarly low, but in Oakland, a rapidly gentrifying city where many of the players cannot afford to live, the issues are magnified further. Laney is a community college; its student-athletes are not on scholarships and they are ineligible for benefits including on-campus housing.  For Nuâu Taugavau, the teamâs 300-pound offensive lineman, taking this chance on himself and his talent has meant giving up his job as a Walmart greeter and having to lean on his wife for financial support â something he feels increasingly guilty doing. It means that without two incomes, they have to apply for food stamps to feed their two young children, the youngest of which is the baby in the showâs opening scene.  In the case of Dior Walker-Scott, the 5â8â linchpin for the teamâs offense, committing to the Eagles means clocking 10 to 20 hours at the fast-food joint Wingstop after practice every day and sleeping in his car to avoid having to reconcile with a historically abusive father. Unable to afford housing in Oakland proper, some players, including Rezjohn âRay Rayâ Wright, must drive long distances in traffic to get to and from practice every day.  If previous instalments of Last Chance U used football to open the door to broader social concerns, this season finally crosses the threshold. There is an unswerving, steadfast dedication to represent life as it really is for these Laney athletes. In one scene, Walker-Scott is on the phone to his mum (who lives in Arkansas and calls him âcutie pieâ) when she tells him she misses him and asks if he has enough food. He responds, âI miss you too mummy. Sometimes yeah, but some nights no because I donât have money.â  The playersâ unfiltered displays of vulnerability are surprising and touching, especially in the context of a sport that notoriously holds no space for feelings beyond fraternal bonds expressed through chest bumps and back slaps. It is no doubt in part due to coach John Beam: the grey-haired, green-tracksuited 60-something with a tan so deep youâd think it came from a bottle if it wasnât paired with an accent so obviously Californian. Together with his assistant coaches (who knew American football necessitated so many?), Beam works day in, day out to transform these 90 individual athletic units into one well-oiled kicking, throwing, catching, tackling, hurdling machine. His racehorse work-ethic and love for the f-word, though, is where the similarities between Beam and his Last Chance U predecessors end.  Fans of the series will know that the figure of a despotic and sociopathically competitive coach has been a fixture in Last Chance U since the series began. In 2019 coach Jason Brown, the cigar-smoking hyper-aggressive braggart who appeared like something straight out of Full Metal Jacket, resigned after texting a German player on his squad, âIâm your new Hitler.â Every season bore renewed disappointment for viewers hoping for a coachâs redemptive arc; underneath all that screaming and bravado, there was no gooey centre after all â just more screaming. Thatâs not to say Coach Beam does not yell. Screaming, swearing and threats are still rife and Beam regularly loses his temper at the players, at the ref, at his assistants. Frustrated by a playerâs inability to follow what he sees as a basic instruction, Beam tells him, âGrow your ass up. I guarantee Iâll rip your f****** nuts off if you f*** up on Sundayâs game.â  But Beamâs hold on the team is intensified by his sincere interest in each of his players as a developing person as well as a successful athlete. And for every threat to castrate them, the coach doubles down on his words of encouragement and emotional support. He is a rare breed of football coach. One that speaks about mental health and PTSD. He does breathing exercises and encourages his team to do the same. When an athlete is particularly struggling, he will sometimes refer them to his wife, a professional therapist specialising in services for people of colour.  Crucially, however, Beam is unafraid to shoulder some of that responsibility too. When Ray Ray is benched with a suspected broken ankle and begins to cry, fearful that he will have to sit out a crucial season on which his career hinges, Beam holds him on the sideline and repeatedly tells him, âI got you.â He kisses his forehead and grips his shoulders: âI love you, man.â And Ray Ray says it back to him.  What is most promising is how quickly Beamâs coaching style fosters a positive team culture. The players take responsibility for their mistakes on the field (âMy bad yâallâ), they voice each otherâs praises (âIâm so motherf****** proud of you, manâ) and pep each other up when the scoreboard is against them (âWhereâs your f****** grit? Whereâs your f****** heart?â). Where the lifeblood of past seasons has been the anger and aggression of larger-than-life coaches, this latest series derives it from a more intimate place; the playerâs shared determination to overcome emotional and economic hardships and their die-hard commitment to supporting one another in doing so.  Thatâs not to say that season five lacks in dramatic slow-motion shots of a football soaring through the posts, nail-biting sequences of a scoreboard ticking up for the opposing team or the bone-crunching sounds of a particularly aggressive tackle. As usual, Whitleyâs camera never misses its target on game day: these boys are rendered superhuman as they accomplish improbable feats in their very own hero costumes of shoulder pads and helmets.  But what is more impressive than the showâs ability to capture this fantasy is its willingness to shatter it in the next scene, and by doing so reveal a more human truth: these young men arenât playing to win, theyâre playing to survive. And their intense motivations to be on the field have little to do with football at all. More important to Taugavau than assisting a game-winning touchdown is converting his skills into diaper money for his babies. Sports documentaries are never actually about sport â Last Chance U: Laney is a blistering testament to that.",https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/pitch-perfect-netflix-last-chance-u-season-5-review-a9647456.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,a512a5ef75ebdeaceca1c2073687583b8553c0c3816475fbeae89c5315d5542e,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:19:52.558163,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 05:27:00 GMT",Face masks: Everything you need to treat face covering acne,"There have been many ways weâve had to adapt to a new way of living through the coronavirus pandemic, from social distancing to not seeing friends and family for months on end.  But one of the biggest adjustments is wearing a face covering. As of 24 July, face coverings are now mandatory in all shops and supermarkets in England. These rules will also extend to indoor shopping centres, banks, travel hubs and post offices. People who don't will face a fine of up to Â£100, apart from people with medical conditions and children under 11.  If you're picking up a takeaway coffee or food in England, you'll also have to wear a mask, but this rule doesn't apply to sit-in meals.  Since 15 June, anyone travelling by train, Tube, bus, ferry or plane in England has also had to wear a face covering. People who don't can be refused on transport and fined Â£100. Those under the age of 11 and people with disabilities or breathing problems are exempt, as well as anyone travelling with someone who lip-reads.  Boris Johnson announced an extension to these rules in a government briefing on 31 July. From 8 August, face masks will become compulsory in more indoor settings where you're likely to come into contact with people you don't normally meet, including cinemas, museums, galleries and places of worship.  As a result, when going outdoors, seeing people wearing face coverings is slowly becoming the ""new normal"". In our face mask buying guide, weâve covered the different types of mask, what to consider before you buy one and how to wear and wash one.  You can trust our independent round-ups. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections. This revenue helps us to fund journalism across The Independent.  Since the beginning of lockdown, many businesses have pivoted their production to manufacturing face masks, along with individuals creating their own via retailers such as Etsy. Other larger retailers who have launched cloth face masks include Mango and Asos, along with independent brands including Aeibe, Newt, Just Hype, Florence Bridge, Plumo and Wawa Clothing.  However, as face masks have become as necessary as your keys when leaving the house, you may have found after wearing them that your skin has started to breakout, a condition which has been dubbed âmaskneâ.  Dr Adil Sheraz, consultant dermatologist and British skin foundation spokesperson explains how it happens: âDue to the tight-fitting nature of the mask, this can lead to blockage of the follicular openings (the surface of the epidermis) and cause outbreaks of spots and acne, the increased sweating doesnât help either.â  Because masks are fitted to your face, moisture from breathing while wearing one can become trapped on the skin, increasing humidity which Dr Sheraz says can also cause breakouts.  âAlso, the act of constantly adjusting and touching the mask and thus touching your face will transfer oil, dirt and irritants to the skin.â  To minimise this, he recommends a custom-fitted mask, but if that's not possible, stick to breathable material such as silk, or silk lined masks. He goes on to say: âA silk mask with multiple layers would be ideal for sensitive acne-prone skin.â  Cotton cloth masks are also soft enough to be comfortable on sensitive skin and typically are lightweight, made in pleated or moulded designs to better fit your face.  To ensure youâre as protected as possible, look for cotton masks that have a built-in filter or a pocket which you can add a filter too. The coverings from Aeibe are made in England with 100 per cent cotton lining and 100 per cent non-woven polypropylene filters from Korea on the inside.  It also has a soft nose clip to help it shape to your face and stretchy ear loops to keep it secure. Each masks also comes with a cotton bag to keep it safe when you're not wearing it and a spare filter.  Aeibe have designed its masks using vibrant fabrics from Liberty of London with built-in filters ( Aeibe )  If you have a reusable cloth mask, Dr Sheraz advises to wash it regularly, not only is it vital in protecting against the coronavirus but will also clear any oil, dirt or bacteria that could result in skin irritation or acne.  So how should your skincare routine change to adapt to wearing a mask and reducing maskne? With the help of dermatologists, we've compiled the products and ingredients to use that will alleviate aggravated skin.  Cleansing  Dr Toni Phillips, group clinical director at Destination Skin, stresses the importance of cleansing properly to keep pesky spots at bay.  ""It minimises congested skin and clogged pores, which can lead to inflammation, large pores, blackheads and a dull and uneven complexion. The right cleanser for your skin type will remove excess oil if present, gently exfoliate dead skin cells and debris, whilst leaving the skin barrier intact,"" she says.  If you have a combination-oily skin type, and therefore are often prone to acne, she recommends the SkinCeuticals blemish and age cleanser (lookfantastic, Â£40), a lightweight gel formula that has exfoliating agents to decongest pores.  This gel cleanser will remove makeup, SPF, dirt and grime build up that can clog pores and cause breakouts ( lookfantastic )  To apply, massage into a wet face and neck, morning and evening, then rinse with warm water and flannel.  If you like to wear make-up under your mask, experts recommend double-cleansing in the evenings to ensure pores do not become clogged, which can exacerbate acne. If you don't remove make-up properly, it will also render any products you use after less effective as they're required to be applied to a completely clean face in order to work.  This means using a balm or oil-based cleanser to remove make-up and SPF, followed by a lighter gel or milk cleanser to thoroughly cleanse the skin. The Clinique take the day off cleansing balm (John Lewis & Partners, Â£21.25) is a great all-rounder.  A rich cleansing balm will melt down into an oil once massaged into dry skin and remove makeup, dirt and grime at the end of the day ( Clinique )  Itâs fragrance-free (a known skin irritant) and once massaged onto a dry face, melts down all make-up, even the most stubborn of mascaras.

Look for ingredients lists that contain salicylic, glycolic and lactic acids, which exfoliate, dissolve gunk and grime and break down debris clogging pores, which cause spots.  We love the Typology salicylic acid serum (Typology Paris, Â£11.80). The vegan, fragrance-free formula is fast-acting and within a few days of use, you will see a reduction in the size of your spots.  While suitable for all skin types, this salicylic acid serum will particularly benefit acne-prone complexions ( Typology Paris )  As it does specifically target blemishes, you only need to apply it to those areas, rather than your whole face.  Topping our IndyBest guide to spot treatments was the Ren Skincare clearcalm non-drying spot treatment (Ren, Â£17.50).  It's a gentle treatment containing willow bark and salicylic acid which dissolves grime build-up in pores, and has prebiotics in it to rebalance the good bacteria on your skin and prevent future breakouts.  Our reviewer said: ""It doesnât cause flakiness, can be worn beneath make-up, and had a noticeable impact on swelling, size and redness in just 10 hours"".  Moisturise  As the last step in your skincare regimen, using moisturiser plays an important part in tackling maskne.  According to consultant dermatologist Dr Justine Hextall, a light moisturiser with hydrating ingredients such as glycerine and ceramides will help prevent irritation from your mask.  The La Roche-Posay effaclar duo + SPF30 (Boots, Â£17.50) is a gel-based moisturiser that impressed us in our guide to the best SPF moisturisers.  Applying this moisturiser morning and night will reduce inflammation, redness and irritated skin  While it wonât clear up spots overnight (letâs face it nothing will do that), it will reduce blemishes. our reviewer saw noticeably clearer skin within a week of use.  Moisturisers work to retain water and prevent water loss in the skin, acting as a protective barrier ( Look Fantastic )  It has a mattifying finish too which will control a shiny forehead and nose. Best of all it contains a broad-spectrum sunscreen so youâll be adequately protected from UVA and UVB rays while keeping imperfections at bay.  Alternatively, try the Dr Dennis Gross Skincare hyaluronic marine oil-free moisture cushion (Net-A-Porter, Â£59), a lightweight gel texture in a hyaluronic-acid rich formula that will prevent water loss without leaving your skin feeling greasy or overloaded.  Oil-free formulas will work best for acne, as they minimise oil production, which can clog pores and increase breakouts and won't add extra shine.

""So there is an element of that, and it is about 20 per cent at the moment where people can't remember or never knew the contact... the details of where they were.""

Instead we have seen no app in England, and a test and trace system that is not fit for purpose yet.â  The remarks from Mr Soames also comes after professor John Edmunds, a member of the governmentâs Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), criticised the ineffective nature of the NHS Test and Trace scheme.  Asked about Boris Johnsonâs claim to have a âworld beatingâ track and trace system to tackle the virus spreading, he told BBC Newsnight: âHonestly I couldnât care less whether itâs world beating or not. I just want it to be virus beating â and itâs not.â  He added that the system is âquite clunkyâ and takes a considerable amount of time to get the information out of individuals about their contacts.  âThey might give the initial information then start to get a bit sick of the whole process and give up,â he said. âI think thatâs a problem â a problem for just collecting the data. They collect metrics about how well they are doing, the NHS test and trace, but as epidemiologists we kind of want other metrics to be measured and they are not really doing that at the moment.â",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-test-and-trace-scheme-missing-data-uk-serco-a9657106.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,84484eb4935d4e21abc225166da731f09d206eccc4e5d130a2ced5ca08cc7f8e,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Help is desperately needed to support wildlife rangers, local communities and law enforcement personnel to prevent wildlife crime. Donate to help Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade here.  For a single mother living in Zimbabwe, the job prospects are limited; growing food to sell, sewing or cooking.  But a new community development initiative is training them to be a crucial part of the anti-poaching front line, with a focus on female empowerment.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Community Scouts are a squad of wildlife-protecting troops, trained by National Park Rescue and supported by charity Space for Giants, who provide equipment and pay their salaries â which are much more than a living wage.  âThis programme has changed my life,â says Sithabile Munenge, 33. Before becoming a community scout she sold tomatoes on a dusty roadside to make money to care for her children, aged nine and two. âBut it wasnât enough to look after them.  âUsually men are the first preference to be employed by companies. But now I have the respect of my community, and I will be able to build my childrenâs future.â  Zimbabwe has some of Africaâs largest game reserves, home to thriving populations of elephant, buffalo, impala and wildebeest.  The threat from poaching looms large, especially where the female Community Scouts operate in Chizarira National Park, a remote wilderness which lost over 3,000 elephants between 2006 and 2016.  Covering just under 2,000km sq, Chizariraâs rugged valleys and soaring mountains make it a vulnerable landscape, with plenty of places for poachers to hide.  Recently a spate of cyanide poisonings blamed on poachers in nearby Hwange National Park led to 80 elephants dying.

Log in to update your newsletter preferences Register with your social account or click here to log in I would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by email Update newsletter preferences  To mark World Rangers Day, The Independent is celebrating all those who work to protect wildlife, as part of our Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign.  The campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on the poaching and illegal trade of wild animals, which remains one of the greatest threats to future biodiversity.  Funds raised will pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaignâs partner Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animals.  Community Scouts walk long distances patrolling Chizarira to remove snares â or wildlife traps â and look for signs of illegal activity, apprehending any suspected poachers they encounter.  âThe best thing about my job is protecting wild animals,â says 23-year-old scout and mum-of-one Siphathisiwe Muleya. âBefore I started I was scared of elephants. Now I am proud of the work I do.â  Patient Munsaka, 23, who has a three-year-old son, agrees: âThis is my first ever job and at first I felt afraid when I was patrolling in the bush.  âBut day by day patrolling has encouraged me and given me self-motivation. I have learnt so much and developed love for wild animals. It is a dream come true.â  The creation of a team of Community Scouts comprised entirely of single mums was the brainchild of Niall McCann and Mark Hiley of National Park Rescue. They saw an opportunity to turn a wildlife security need into a community outreach programme, which gained the full support of Zimbabweâs Parks and Wildlife Management Authority.  National Park Rescue advertised the roles in the chieftainships â or areas â neighbouring Chizarira, making it clear that candidates had to be single mothers and were not expected to know much, if anything, about conservation.  McCann, National Park Rescueâs conservation director, told The Independent: âWe were looking for friendly recruits who were eager to learn, and the five successful women each come from a different chieftainship.  âThe local culture is strongly patriarchal, and some people are unsure about women working in a role traditionally seen as male. But employment is valued so highly that most people are accepting of anyone having a job, as the benefits filter down into the wider community.â  McCann adds: âWomen are just as capable as their male counterparts, and their conversational networks are more likely to reveal intelligence on illegal activity. Importantly, they also invest more of their salary back into their family than men do, so we are better able to build community resilience and reduce poverty.â  The people most affected by poverty in Africa are usually women, an issue that has only intensified since Covid-19 struck. McCann hopes to train another five single mothers in the next 12 months, a model that offers a potential solution for some women, based on empowerment and training.  Community scout Jeska Muleya is 21 and has a three-year-old son. She says: âI was excited and emotional when I found out I had been chosen [to be a scout], to participate in the preservation of wildlife for future generations.  âBefore this, I didnât know anything about myself. The training has taught me teamwork and discipline, and shown me what I am capable of.  âIn the future, I hope to be able to build a house for my family. I hope this job carries on forever.â  The increased threat of poaching since the global pandemic has seen the Community Scouts stepping up patrols, meaning even more hill climbs for the women as they keep watch over Chizariraâs jagged terrain.  âIâm tired at the end of each day after so much walking, but it feels good,â says Anita Mudenda, 19, who has a two-year-old daughter called Princess. âThere must be animals in our childrenâs future. It is our obligation to protect them for that reason.  âMy daughter is happy about what Iâm doing. She wants to be just like me.â",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/stop-the-illegal-wildlife-trade-zimbabwe-single-mothers-anti-poaching-a9647226.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,8e202f1f7387da551d130c24a66db1d57ad2e367801160e3a1aa9826d59b1d0a,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

2020-08-06 13:19:54.567886,"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 09:23:00 GMT",âWrecking our livesâ: Foreign nationals unable to work or see dying relatives because of visa gridlock,"The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a contribution.  A gridlock in the UKâs visa processing system has left people unable to work or travel to see dying relatives during the pandemic despite being legally resident, prompting renewed criticism of the Home Officeâs privatised visa service.  Hundreds and possibly thousands of foreign nationals have been left in a âstate of limboâ after being informed that although visa centres have reopened, they must continue to wait before they can proceed with submitting their biometrics.  Foreign nationals in the UK are required to submit their biometric information, such as fingerprints, in order to obtain a visa. This process usually takes place in centres across the country run by firm Sopra Steria, which is contracted by the Home Office to deliver the service.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Before the private company took over the contract last year, applicants could go to their local post office to provide biometric data. Under Sopra Steriaâs service, they must attend one of six âcore centresâ across the country that offer a free service, or one of another 51 that usually charge a fee starting from Â£69.99.  However, these centres were closed in March because of the lockdown, putting the process on hold. A phased reopening of the centres began on 1 June, but nearly two months on, many applicants are still âin limboâ.  At the start of July, the Home Office informed applicants who had previously applied for UK visas that they would be put through a new process which would reuse biometrics they had submitted previously, and that therefore they could not book an appointment at one of the visa centres. But there has been no update since on when this new process will begin.  Meanwhile, first-time applicants, who can still book appointments, have found that there are no free appointments being offered by Sopra Steria, despite the fact that all core centres are supposed to provide slots without charge. This has left some unable to afford to submit their biometrics, or having to travel long distances to do so.  David Pountney, senior solicitor at Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit (GMIAU), told The Independent there would be hundreds, if not thousands, of people in this situation.  âWithout having that current, valid immigration document, people run into difficulties. People donât have the documents and they donât have anything else they can use to prove their right to be here,â he said.  âAlthough in theory an employer or a landlord could contact the Home Office to check their immigration status, theyâre not likely to, and even if they do, the Home Office sometimes get it wrong.â  Daily coronavirus briefing No hype, just the advice and analysis you need Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Weâve got no clarity on who is likely to be covered by this new system or what the process is, so we have to play it by ear.â  Andrew Tingley, partner and head of immigration at Womble Bond Dickinson (UK) LLP, said: âThousand of applicants are currently in limbo as a result of the Home Office policy of allowing the re-use of biometrics.â  He argued that visa applicants should be given the choice on whether to opt into the new system of reusing biometrics.  Not allowed to work  Filipino national Sharon Phillips, 32, moved to the UK in December 2019 to join her husband Hywel on a six-month fiancÃ© visa. They married in February and applied for her spouse visa in May, but the closure of visa centres meant she couldnât submit her biometrics at the time.  The couple assumed that once the centres opened in June, they would be able to continue with the process, but they are still waiting â and until Sharon obtains her spouse visa, she is unable to work.  Sharon, who worked as a domestic worker in Malaysia before she came to the UK, said: âItâs frustrating. I canât work. I canât travel. I canât do anything right now. I was hoping to work in a care home. I know there are vacancies in care homes at the moment. I want to, but what do I do?  âFinancially I donât have anything right now. Iâm totally reliant on my husband. Heâs also supporting my family back home in the Philippines.  âIâm just at home. I have nothing to look forward to. Iâm hoping none of my family get sick because if that happens, I wonât be able to go back home to see them. Weâre just waiting and waiting. Iâm just stuck in limbo.â  Hywel, 31, who met Sharon while studying in Malaysia, said: âItâs hard to believe that they shut down all visa processing for three months, when itâs such an essential service. And it looks like there was no forward thinking about how to deal with the backlog once it reopened.  âWeâve been trying to wait patiently, but thereâs so much uncertainty. Weâve now been told we have to go down this path of reusing biometrics, but itâs a new system that hasnât been tested, and thereâs no date for it yet. Will it be one more month? Will it be three more months? We really donât know how long this will take.â  Unable to see dying father  Emre and Elif Gunes said they were feeling âdesperateâ because, as a result of the delays, they have been unable to travel to Turkey to visit Elifâs father, who has cancer and has been in a critical state since 13 July.  The Turkish couple, both of whom work as engineers in the UK, applied for an extension in April as the visas were set to expire on 19 June, but â although the process should normally take a few weeks â they still havenât been able to submit their biometrics in order to complete the process.  They were hopeful when Sopra Steria announced on 1 June that appointments would be allocated by the order of the application submission dates, but they have since been told that they will be going through the new process of reusing previously submitted biometrics, and have been given no time frame as to when it will be up and running.  Elif, 29, said: âI feel guilt and desperation every second of every day knowing that my family needs my support more than ever before, but I cannot promise them I will be there soon. This adds another unbearable dimension to my existing sorrow and fears.  âMy heart beats fast whenever my phone rings, not only because I am scared to hear any more bad news about my fatherâs situation but also I do not know what is going to happen to my job and life here if I choose to go home. Do I have to leave my job and life behind just because this visa extension process is not working properly? This is the pressure I am under constantly.â  Emre, 31, said that on top of the distress of being unable to see his father-in-law, he was concerned about losing his job and, in the current situation, being unable to find a new one: âIt was already too much stress for me. What I am going to do if I lose my job due to the pandemic? Will it be possible to find a new job with sponsorship?â  He added: âWe were hoping we could at least visit [my father-in-law] once travel restrictions were lifted, but then we got an update from the Home Office about reusing biometrics. They havenât mentioned any deadline or time frame. This situation is wrecking our lives, just after the Home Office gave us some hope.â  Unable to take up job offer  Debasish Dash, a mathematician who has been working in the UK since 2016, has been unable to take up a job as a lecturer at Strathclyde University, which he was supposed to start at the beginning of July, because it has not been possible for him to complete the visa process.  The 33-year-old Indian national, who applied for a Global Talent Visa â which the government introduced in February to attract âtalented and promising individuals in specific sectorsâ â is currently working at Cambridge University in a job that he was supposed to have left a month ago. The university has been able to source additional research funding for him to continue, but this will end in August.  âI will be unemployed. Researchers are not paid a lot. Because of the governmentâs mistake Iâll have to dig into my savings and start paying my rent and my bills from my savings. It just makes no sense,â he said.  âItâs nonsense. Everything was in place for me to start the new job in July, but now I donât know how long I will have to wait because the government is not telling us anything.  âBanks and post offices were open. Why were visa centres closed for two months? Even since theyâve opened, why is there a complete lack of urgency? Theyâre very slow and theyâre giving us no time frame. Theyâre trying to attract talented people, yet theyâre putting me through this stress.â  âAfraid to leave the houseâ  Another Indian national, who didnât want to be named, said he was afraid to go outside in case anyone in authority requested to see his residence permit, which he is currently unable to provide because his visa ran out on 30 May, and he hasnât been able to process his new one because has been told to wait for the new biometrics service.  The 25-year-old, who moved to the UK in January 2017 and works in the IT sector, said: âI find it tough to go out because police may ask for your permit to stay in the UK and I donât have that. Iâve hardly been out in the last two months.  âIâm worried. I donât have any proof of my status to show Iâm eligible to be in this country. I canât do anything. Itâs important to have freedom and to have a visa to show youâre allowed to be in this country. What weâre going through is something no one is noticing.â  The young man said he was also distressed by the fact that his sister had recently given birth to her first child in India, and he had been unable to travel to see his family.  âI want to know what will happen to me. I donât [want to] be waiting like this. My parents in India are very scared about what will happen to me. Iâm a 25-year-old individual whose dreams came true when he got a job in the UK. But everything has become so bad,â he added.  A Sopra Steria spokesperson said: âWe recognise it has been a difficult time for people unable to access appointments because of the global pandemic.â  They confirmed that the firm was looking to introduce new measures involving the reuse of fingerprint biometrics that have been recorded in a previous application, and said more information would be provided on this âvery soonâ.  The spokesperson said that since the phased reopening of centres on 1 June, the company had made âsignificantâ progress in reducing the number of customers waiting for an appointment and was working to release new appointments.  A Home Office spokesperson said: âThe Covid-19 pandemic has had an impact on some visa services as we operate with a reduced capacity to observe social distancing. Weâve adapted our working practices in order to clear applications as soon as possible, which includes reusing the fingerprint biometrics of some of our customers to re-enrol and stop people having to attend in person.â",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-visa-delay-coronavirus-pandemic-immigration-a9636531.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,46b1047e39f80dcab8001a45b8f653e3c5d85976657e18efb6544cae86fab516,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

To support us, please consider a contribution.  Bayern Munichâs Jerome Boateng is one of the elder statesmen of the Bundesliga, but he has been most enthused by its metamorphosis into a talent hub in recent years.  Germanyâs top flight has proved to be development gold for gifted young players looking to pick up regular minutes in a fast, intense division â and has also become a favoured transfer mine for Europeâs elite clubs.  Ahead of the new season, Chelsea have already recruited Timo Werner for Â£48million from RB Leipzig and are in negotiations to land the Â£90m-rated Kai Havertz from Bayer Leverkusen.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Frank Lampard benefited from the brilliance of Christian Pulisic in 2019-20, nurtured at Borussia Dortmund, so it was no surprise to see the club return to the German market to spend huge outlays on players with high ceilings.  Manchester United are primed to join them. Jadon Sancho has been Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâs priority target, and while there is some distance between BVBâs valuation and the price the club are willing to pay at present, all signs point to a deal going through this summer.  Scouts serving the Premier League and La Liga have also been doing due diligence on Dayot Upamecano, Weston McKennie, Christopher Nkunku and Ozan Kabak â to name just a few.  âI think it shows the Bundesliga teams give young talent time to grow,â Boateng says. âI think they feel well treated in Germany. They have time to grow slowly.  âSometimes as a young player, you have times when you donât play so well. In some other countries I think it is really strict â they have a bad game, they are out for weeks.  âIn Germany, they take care of them. The clubs give them confidence, so thatâs why they grow so well.â  The defender has enjoyed watching Pulisicâs game-changing displays for Chelsea after four years at Signal Iduna Park â an eventuality he envisaged.  âIf I donât have the wrong information, when he just arrived he didnât have such a good start,â Boateng says as he thinks back to the forwardâs adjustment period at Stamford Bridge. âI think he improved in the last few months. Iâm not surprised.  âHe was always a great player in the Bundesliga and I think the step for him to Chelsea was really good for him to improve in a different league. He brings a lot of good things for the team when he comes in. Even if he doesnât start, he creates goals, scores goals and heâs in a really good performance level at the moment.â  Boateng, who spent the 2010-11 season at Manchester City in which they won the FA Cup that sparked their appetite for trophies, also expects Werner to become a luminary. The same applies if Havertz and Sancho complete switches to England.  âAll these players had really good seasons,â Boateng says. âKai, Timo and Sancho are all really good talents. They have played for a long time now and I think they are all ready for the Premier League.  âOf course you have to show that first of all. Itâs not that easy because itâs a different league. The intensity is different. Itâs a different style of game. They have to see if they feel comfortable and like it there.â  Boateng is grateful for the year he spent in England, even if it was hampered by a knee injury and playing out of position at right-back. Given the opportunity, heâd love to experience the division again.  âI would not say no. I love the Premier League, I loved also when I was there to play,â he says. âIt was really unlucky because I got injured straight away and then I didnât really play the position they promised me.  âBut I still took a lot from this year, playing in the Premier League, it helped me a lot to play and train with great players, world-class players.  âI am definitely down for it, but I donât know for the future. You never know. But itâs not that I would say âI never want to play thereâ. Itâs one of my favourite leagues for sure.â  Leroy Sane has made the same move â City to Bayern â and Boateng expects âextra creativityâ from the attacker.  âHeâs an outstanding player and is coming back from a long injury so maybe he needs a little bit of time now to get back where he was,â he says. âBut I am sure he will be even better than he was before. We have players who are special and he has that, also, and can decide games on his own.â  For all the talk of the ability of others, Boateng has been in exceptional form himself, playing 34 times this season. He says this season âhas brought back the joy in footballâ having featured the most since 2014-15.  When he was out of the team, the centre-back had contemplated whether his future would be better served away from the Allianz Arena.  âThere were hard times,â he says. âItâs like being a child: as a child if I had no confidence, if you donât get trust from your friends you play with, then you lose the joy of the game and fun.  âThatâs what happens now, even when Iâm older. Of course there were thoughts at some stage, âdo I need to change now?â Because like this I really not get a fair chance. Of course, you think about this because I wonât play football for ever and I want to enjoy football.  âI knew still trained good, I worked hard and in my opinion â not everybody has to have the same opinion â I deserved a chance to play and and to show more that I can play at a high level.  âThat was it, and at some point if you see itâs not working between the sides then you have to make a clean, but like a nice cut, not a dirty cut.â  Boateng ultimately didnât need to do that and is now targeting adding another Champions League trophy to his haul.  âI think every season of course has its own story and to win this Champions League... itâs always something special to win the Champions League, but this is not like every year,â he says, referring to the coronavirus-enforced suspension of football and how its reshaped the format of the tournament.  âItâs really hard work and itâs special, it has its own story to it, and now also of course to the team who will win it. At the end, they will say, we won the Champions League with this kind of little tournament, it was different, but we made it.  âOf course, every team and me personally, I want to win the Champions League again, because itâs amazing and it pays off great work as a team. Itâs really hard to win the Champions League, itâs not easy. How we talk, âOh, you go to Chelsea, you do this, do this and then youâve wonâ â itâs not like that.  âThere are always lots of things you need to do to win the Champions League. First of all you need a little bit of luck â you see that over the years, with things like referee decisions or how sometimes you donât perform as a team like you should.  âSo itâs a lot of stuff that comes together and little details in the end decide whether you go to the next round or win the final. So I think as a team you have to have a strong mentality, everyone has to go in the one direction and thatâs really important.  âYou see the teams who won the Champions League, including the last years: they always prepare well and as a team whether it is Madrid or Liverpool, they were like a little family sticking together.â",https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/jadon-sancho-manchester-united-transfer-havertz-werner-baten-a9656951.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,ea7065352cd55b01080c49c5e234091647165c17a7e37ec6cd47bc31b1b248e4,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

A Laudamotion flight to Vienna was accelerating along the runway when the left engine suffered a contained failure. During the subsequent evacuation, 10 passengers were hurt.  The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has urged âresearch to determine how to prevent passengers from obstructing aircraft evacuations by retrieving carry-on baggageâ.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  The report recommends that the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) build in âa more realistic simulation of passenger behaviour in regard to carry-on baggage in the test criteria and procedures for the emergency demonstrationâ.  On the evening of 1 March 2019, a Laudamotion Airbus A320 with 169 passengers and seven crew, was departing from Stansted airport in Essex to Vienna, the airlineâs base.  As the jet began its take-off roll, the pilots heard a loud bang, which turned out to be a contained failure of the left engine.  They stopped the aircraft on the runway as the fire service attended. When it became clear there was no fire danger, the pilots prepared to taxi the aircraft off the runway.  But due to a mix-up, the senior member of cabin crew ordered an emergency evacuation.  The report says evacuation was ânot necessary in the circumstancesâ but was âprobably the result of a combination of factors that heightened her emotional response to the event and affected her decision makingâ.  The evacuation command was potentially dangerous, the report says: âAs a result of the flight crew not being consulted before the evacuation was commenced, the right engine remained running for the first few minutes of the evacuation.  âThis led to an increased risk of serious injury to those passengers that evacuated on the right side of the aircraft.  âIndeed, several passengers sustained minor injuries having been blown over by the exhaust.â  âPassengers crossing behind the engine exhaust could have been exposed to âwindâ speeds of 65 mph or greater, even with the engines running at idle.â  Shape Created with Sketch.

Safety briefings are supposed to emphasise the importance of leaving hand baggage behind in an evacuation.  But the report says: âOne passenger thought that about half of the passengers took their hand baggage with them.  âWhile some were removed by the flight attendants at the supervised exits, this was not possible at the overwing exits.""  In a report two years ago, the Royal Aeronautical Society said: âThis trend appears to be increasing and can only be exacerbated by the increasing volume of cabin baggage being permitted by some operators for commercial reasons.  âAviation authorities should consider the feasibility of introducing a certification requirement for a means of remotely locking, from the flight deck, overhead bins in passenger cabins that do not contain emergency equipment, for taxi, take-off and landing.â  But some safety experts fear that locking the bins could delay evacuation as passengers struggled to retrieve their belongings.

The housing secretary added that he had âno ideaâ how much property tycoons had given the Tories since Boris Johnson became prime minister when challenged on the BBC. âMinisters are not involved in those issues, that is entirely for the Conservative Party,â he said.  On the governmentâs planning reforms, published today in a White Paper, the cabinet minister insisted âdesign and qualityâ were at the heart of the governmentâs new proposals. Responding to criticism from the Royal Institute of British Architects which said the plans are ""shameful"" and do ""almost nothing to guarantee the building of affordable, well-designed and sustainable homes"", Mr Jenrick told talkRADIO: ""I think that is complete nonsense.  ""More money is going to be spent on social infrastructure as a result of these reforms than has been in the past, and a much simpler system.

2020-08-06 13:19:56.348627,"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 05:02:00 GMT",âItâs one rule for men and another for womenâ: Beauty salons criticise governmentâs âsexistâ reopening guidelines,"Beauty salons in England have been forced to delay reopening fully after Boris Johnson postponed lifting lockdown restrictions further due to a rise in Covid-19 infections.  Salons were initially permitted to reopen, along with tattoo parlours, tanning shops, and nail bars, partially on 13 July and were meant to reopen fully on 1 August to allow treatments involving the face. However, this has now been delayed to the increase in coronavirus cases in the north of England.  Salons have been told that facial treatments are still too dangerous due to the increased risk of spreading Covid-19 between workers and customers. This is because splashes and droplets from the nose and mouth could be easily transmitted from one person to another. Although workers understand the science, they have criticised the details of the plan as âsexistâ because the list of permissible treatments deem a beard trim safe, but eyebrow threading unsafe, when both require close proximity.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  The discrepancy has sparked outrage in the beauty industry. The Beauty Guild, the UKâs largest trade body representing over 16,000 beauty professionals, has written an open letter to Boris Johnson, urging him to reconsider, stating: âWhile it is understandable that some treatments must remain off-limits, there is no scientific reason why eyebrow treatments pose more of a threat than beard trimming.â  Beauty Guild director Rebecca Archer says the large majority of its members are female entrepreneurs who have suffered financial hardship during lockdown. âImposing further unnecessary restrictions on their livelihoods is grossly unfair,â she tells The Independent, adding that the rules âfavour the grooming needs of men over womenâ.  Salon owners are equally frustrated by the restrictions. âThis is such a patriarchal issue to allow barbers to provide facial treatments for men, while women canât get any facial treatments at all,â says Aya Hassan, founder of Portobello Girl beauty salon in west London, who pointed out that barbers often administer facial treatments themselves on men. âThey all have steamer cabins for hot towels, so what is the difference?â she asks.  Several beauticians have argued that the rules donât make sense in terms of proximity to the client, given that you have to be just as close to someone to trim their beard as you do to wax their eyebrows, for example. âI find it hard to believe it makes a difference if you are cutting hair, trimming a beard, doing nails or facials,â says Katie White, facialist at Re:lax in east London.  âWe havenât seen any science that confirms the virus can tell the difference between 10, 20 or 30cm distance, nor if the facial hair belongs to a man or a woman. In all of these treatments you are touching the client, hence the need for PPE, taking temperatures on arrival, having hand sanitation stations on entry and very strict cleaning protocols. It does feel like it is one rule for men and another for women.â  Many salons will lose out on a significant portion of their business due to the rules. Sam Marshall, owner of The Beauty Guru in Salford, explains that facial treatments are one of their key services, making up almost a third of the business. âThis will be a major blow,â she adds. Similarly, Penny Weston, director of Moddershall Oaks Country Spa Retreat in Staffordshire, says that not being able to offer facials will result in a 25 per cent loss in revenue. âHowever, it is not just treatment revenue we will be losing, as we use our facial treatments as a springboard for the retail of our products,â she adds, explaining that the spa profits significantly from the facial products purchased after a treatment.  This will be a major blow Sam Marshall, The Beauty Guru  While salons offering a wide range of services have opened up, those that offer specialist brow or lash treatments have been forced to remain closed.  Brow specialist Liarna Jessica Yearwood, director of Liarna Jessica London, explains that her company has not received any support from the government because she uses a shared space and is therefore not eligible for any grants. âWe have not had any income since 23 March, but we still have ongoing business expenses to pay out. There is a real risk that we may not survive if we do not start working very soon,â she says. âI know this is the same situation for many other beauty-based businesses. I would urge the government to reconsider and our clients would support us in this.â  For some salon owners, itâs already a case of being too little, too late. Edyta Kurowska launched a new lash bar in Oxford Circus shortly before lockdown began and after one week of successful business, has been forced to close down. âTo me, it seems like pure sexism,â she says, stressing that her treatments do not require close contact. âI sit behind my clients, there is no face-to-face contact,â she says.  âI canât imagine you can trim a beard without getting closer to the person than eyelash extension applications require. I am absolutely heartbroken at how beauty businesses have been treated by the government during this pandemic.â  Many industry professionals complain the rules highlight how the beauty industry had long been wrongly perceived as superficial, despite the fact that itâs worth nearly Â£30bn to the UK economy. This view was highlighted in Prime Ministerâs Questions last week, when Mr Johnson was criticised for his response to an enquiry from William Wragg MP about when salons might be able to open. âI am sure that one day I will go with my honourable friend to Lush Beauty, but it is a sad reality for many of those excellent businesses that they cannot yet open in the way they want,â he said.  Leisa Roberts, who runs a brow studio in Chester, says such a response shows how the industry is disregarded by those in power. âItâs evident from recent comments and laughter from Prime Ministerâs Questions, as an industry we are perceived as frivolous and unnecessary when in fact this couldnât be further from the truth,â she says.  âWe treat thousands of clients suffering after chemotherapy, from alopecia, polycystic ovaries, or low self-esteem and take our roles in their recovery and safety very seriously.â Roberts adds that not being able to administer any eyebrow treatments is âcatastrophicâ for her business. âBeauty businesses as a whole are now under severe financial strain and at risk of closure.â  A government spokesperson told The Independent that the guidance had been developed alongside the beauty industry and did not indicate any change of rules would be forthcoming, despite the widespread criticism. âTreatments, for example, eyelash extensions, which require the practitioner to be very close to the clientâs face for an extended period of time, put workers and customers at a much greater risk of transmission of the virus. These should therefore not take place.  âThe guidance is clear that intricate detailing, outlining or shaving of beards should also not be provided and very basic trimming of beards should only take place if away from the highest risk zone â the area in front of the face.â",https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/women/beauty-salon-sexist-rules-reopening-government-guidelines-a9616261.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,8d7e311ff055e303d086f507cc59ea8dae9957ea56fc390bb694fb20f8fd64ea,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:19:56.982982,"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 19:46:00 GMT","Trafficking victimsâ financial support slashed unlawfully during coronavirus pandemic, lawyers warn","The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a contribution.  Hundreds of trafficking survivors have had their financial support slashed unlawfully during the coronavirus pandemic, lawyers warn.  People recognised as potential victims of modern slavery who have been placed in hotels and other interim accommodation during lockdown stopped receiving their weekly government allowance â which is designed to aid their recovery â without warning last month.  The Home Office is facing a legal challenge over its decision to cut their financial support, with lawyers stating that there is no legal basis for such practice as it places vulnerable people at risk of re-trafficking.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  In one case seen by The Independent, a Kenyan woman â believed to have been trafficked to the UK and held in a brothel where she was forced to have sex daily â has been unable to access essential toiletries including sanitary pads and toothpaste, nor top-up for her phone in order to contact her support worker and legal representatives.  A number of victims, including this woman, have recently had their support reinstated after their lawyers challenged the individual cases in court. The department is now facing a legal challenge to restore support for hundreds of other trafficking survivors who have been affected.  Individuals whom the government decides there are âreasonable groundsâ to believe have been subjected to modern slavery enter a framework called the National referral Mechanism (NRM), under which they receive weekly subsistence of either Â£35 or Â£65 per week. Those who are also seeking asylum often live in asylum accommodation, but they continue to receive the same rates of financial support.  During the coronavirus lockdown, a number of these individuals were placed in hotels along with other asylum seekers, due to a shortage of accommodation. While there was initially no change to their support rates, in early July it was reduced to nothing, with no warning given to them or their lawyers.  The Home Office said slavery victims who were also asylum seekers and accommodated in full-board facilities did not receive a cash allowance because they had all utilities, meals and essentials provided.  The UKâs independent anti-slavery commissioner Dame Sara Thornton wrote to safeguarding minister Victoria Atkins on Friday demanding clarity on the change to subsistence rates, and warning that it would âonly further exacerbate the vulnerability of victims of modern slaveryâ.  She stated in the letter that multiple organisations had contacted her office expressing âsignificant concernsâ regarding the change, with some having to provide supermarket vouchers to survivors to enable them to meet their essential needs. She cited one case where a trafficking survivor had resorted to begging following their loss of financial support.

This left her without access to essential toiletries including sanitary pads and toothpaste and unable to top up her phone, use public transport or access the internet.  The woman, who has been diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress disorder, was therefore unable to call her support worker, lawyer or friends who supported her, and could not attend medical or counselling appointments. The hotel at which she was accommodated didnât provide toiletries other than tissues, there was no telephone access for external calls, and the hotel wifi cost Â£7 per day, according to her lawyer.  Heather Malunga, immigration lawyer at the Immigration Advice Service, who represents the woman, said: âThis financial support is intended to protect victims of trafficking and promote their recovery. The Home Officeâs actions leave this very vulnerable group at risk of harm and even re-exploitation.  âThe governmentâs position is that they get toiletries in hotels, but most are not receiving basic essentials, so they have to buy their own. Clothing isnât provided, neither are stamps or phone credit. Theyâre meant to be able to contact their support worker or counsellor when theyâre feeling distressed, but they canât because that money is no longer there.â  The Home Office has been issued a pre-action letter from lawyers at Duncan Lewis Solicitors requesting that it reinstate financial support to all potential victims in hotel accommodation, after the law firm successfully challenged cuts to support for five individuals, whose support was subsequently reinstated.  Ahmed Aydeed, director of public law at the firm, said: âInstead of increasing basic support for victims of trafficking during this pandemic, the home secretary has unlawfully cut the basic subsistence payments made to them. Survivors of trafficking are entitled to this support and desperately need it to enable them to recover and escape from their traffickers.â  He said the charities contracted by the Home Office to provide NRM support seemed to have been âforced into silenceâ, and that it had therefore been left to âcourageousâ survivors to challenge the cuts to ensure others werenât left at an enhanced risk of being re-trafficked.  Zoe Dexter, welfare and housing manager at the Helen Bamber Foundation, which supports at least seven clients who have lost their NRM support, said the charity was âextremely concernedâ by the cuts.  âWe have seen peopleâs mental health deteriorate as a result of being in hotels with no choice about what they eat, where they go, if they have enough money on their phone to call a friend or their GP or therapist or access to the internet,â she said.

UK economic output will shrink by 9.5 per cent this year, an improvement on the 14 per cent previously predicted, the Bank said on Thursday.  However, it warned that unemployment could almost double to 7.5 per cent by the end of 2020, a level that would mean around 2.5 million people are out of work.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is expected to have shrunk by a colossal 20 per cent in the second quarter but the Bank said up-to-date indicators such as consumer spending suggest that the recovery has been stronger than it had thought back in May.  Payments data suggest that household consumption in July was less than 10 per cent below its level at the start of the year while housing market activity appears to have returned to close to normal levels, despite signs that some households are finding it harder to get a mortgage.  The Bankâs Monetary Policy Committee said it expects the economy to grow by 9 per cent in 2021 â taking it back to pre-pandemic levels â before expanding 3.5 per cent in 2022. That puts Threadneedle Street on the optimistic side of economic forecasters, with many analysts predicting a slower recovery that could take several years.  Its central projection for the economy sees GDP continuing to grow as social distancing eases and consumer spending picks up further. Business investment will also recover but âsomewhat more slowlyâ and unemployment will begin to decline from the start of next year, the Bank said.  Survey data suggests that a significant number of the 9.6 million people who had been put on furlough have returned to work, but the Bank warned that âconsiderable uncertainty remains about the prospects for employment after those support schemes unwindâ.  The Labour Party is among a growing chorus of voices urging the government to extend the furlough scheme beyond its planned end date of 31 October to prevent a surge in joblessness.  Responding to the report, Trades Union Congress general secretary Frances OâGrady warned that the threat of mass unemployment had not gone away.

Many companies have a viable future but need longer-term support to get back on their feet.  âAnd the government must invest now to create the jobs we need for the future in green industries, social care and across the public sector.â  The Bank warned that its forecasts were less informative than usual because of the âinherent uncertainties regarding the evolution of the pandemicâ.  Much will depend on how the pandemic evolves and what measures are taken to protect public health and how governments, households and businesses respond.  The Bank added: âThe MPCâs projections assume that the direct impact of Covid-19 on the economy dissipates gradually over the forecast period ... The MPCâs medium-term projections are a less informative guide than usual.â  The MPC said the economy would be supported by the âsubstantial fiscal and monetary policy actionsâ in place. Nonetheless, the recovery in demand will take time as health concerns drag on activity.  The Bankâs economic forecasts came as it opted to keep its benchmark interest rate at a record-low of 0.1 per cent and not to expand its Â£745bn economic stimulus programme.  As expected, the Bankâs rate-setting committee voted unanimously not to change rates or add to stimulus measures.

To support us, please consider a contribution.  A bewildering array of products derived from jaguar parts are driving an alarming increase in the poaching and trafficking of one of Latin Americaâs most iconic species.  Conservationists have reported that jaguar teeth and claws are being marketed as must-have accessories to tourists taking part in traditional ayahuasca ceremonies in Peru. A separate investigation uncovered tubs of a glue-like black paste, made from boiled jaguar carcasses, being smuggled to Asia as an expensive arthritis cure. Jaguar cubs are also known to have been scooped up as pets, only to be sold off for parts when they become too big to handle.  Wildlife trafficking is rising in Latin America, the richest biodiversity hotspot on the planet and home to around 40 per cent of the worldâs plant and animal species. The illegal wildlife trade is an emerging threat on a continent that has historically lacked the large-scale conservation efforts of Africa and Asia.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  It highlights the urgency of our Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, which was launched by The Independent's largest shareholder Evgeny Lebedev to call for an international effort to clamp down on the illegal trade of wild animals, one of the greatest threats to future biodiversity.  Jaguars face a myriad of threats, among them deliberate killings for their fangs, skulls, bones, skins, paws and meat.  The species teetered on the verge of extinction in the mid-20th century when some 18,000 jaguars were killed each year for their skins until, in 1975, international trade in jaguars was banned. Although hunting declined, jaguars still faced retaliatory attacks by humans protecting livestock, and by those who feared the large cats in remote areas.  An estimated 130,000 jaguars are left in the wild, where the solitary cats roam across 18 range countries. Population numbers have declined by around a quarter over the last three generations. They have been wiped out from almost 50 percent of their historic range and are extinct in Uruguay and El Salvador.  Increased poaching has been documented in the Amazon, where jaguars are largely concentrated, particularly in Brazil, Bolivia, Peru and the Guianas. Killings have also been reported in Suriname, Bolivia and Peru.  The species are particularly vulnerable to habitat destruction driven by the rampant deforestation and wildfires being set in the Amazon by land-grabbers for agricultural expansion, logging and mining. Following last yearâs record deforestation and wildfires in the Amazon, last month was the worst June for blazes in 13 years.  Slashing and burning through the rainforest is a twin threat to jaguars: Both destroying their habitat and providing easier access to trophy hunters, criminal trafficking gangs and opportunistic poachers.  The chopping up of âforest corridorsâ leave jaguars particularly vulnerable. The solitary cats require expansive areas of land in which to roam, with males often traveling hundreds of miles to find a mate.  Trapping jaguars in isolated pockets of shrinking forest reduces their ability to hunt, reproduce and remain genetically diverse.  The explosion of trade routes between Latin America and Asia in the past decade, along with the establishment of Chinese-owned mining and logging operations in the region, has played a significant role in the increased demand for wildlife products.  A report last month from TRAFFIC, the NGO focused on trade in wild animals, found that much of the wildlife leaving Latin America is destined for markets in China, and possibly Southeast Asia.  A UN report this month also found that criminals can shift from protected species to alternatives that have a similar value. As tigers becoming increasingly rare in the wild and seizures of parts more common, traffickers are turning their attention to other big cats, including the jaguar, that can be passed off as tiger products.  In February 2018, two Chinese citizens were arrested in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia for possession of 185 jaguar teeth and three skins. In 2018, a criminal gang which had been operating in the Brazilian Amazon state of Acre for the past 30 years, were estimated to have killed more than a 1,000 jaguars, according to TRAFFIC.  But the illegal trade with China is far from the only issue as conservationists warn that further investigation is needed to understand the complex and interwoven threats.  Ayahuasca Tourism  A report last year established a link between illegal sales of jaguar parts and the ayahuasca and shamanic tourist trade.  Ayahuasca ceremonies, an ancient tradition where a psychoactive brew made from the ayahuasca vine and chakruna leaves are used for spiritual healing or specific physical ailments, have grown in popularity among foreign tourists flocking to Latin America.  Itâs big business: In Iquitos, Peru, a hub for ayahuasca lodges, ten of the 40 largest retreats make $6.5 million annually from foreign tourism, according to a 2015 study.  Along the peripheries, small vendors market jaguar body parts from roadside stalls or curio shops to ayahuasca tourists to âenhanceâ their spiritual experiences.  Alex Braczkowski, a researcher at the Resilient Conservation research group, at Griffith University in Australia, co-authored the 2019 study that emerged from a trip to the shamanic hubs of Iquitos, Lima and Pucallpa, Peru in 2017 as part of a National Geographic expedition.  âWe just happened to come across a ton of jaguar parts being openly sold in the streets and by roadside vendors,â he told The Independent. âThey were selling jaguar bags, jaguar skin bracelets, knife sheaths and a lot of canine pendants with cross-sections of the ayahuasca vine stuck on. They were being marketed as a way to enhance the spiritual experience of ayahuasca ceremonies.â  Jaguar skins were being sold for $49-$152, while a single paw could be bought for $9. A stuffed jaguar head was priced at $30â$91 and jaguar canines cost anywhere from $61â$122.  The study noted that âlocal indigenous shamans and healers from the Pucallpa areaâ¦ denied the notion that jaguar parts enhance the ayahuasca experience for visiting tourists, and suggested that this practice is being marketed by âcharlatan shamansâ seeking financial gain from the ayahuasca boom"".  Vendors were also willing to transport the skins internationally, using airport and customs agent contacts, according to the study. (Wildlife traffickers face up to five years in prison under Peruvian law.)  Dr Esteban Payan, South America Jaguar Program Regional Director for Panthera, the global wild cat conservation organisation, told The Independent the illegal trade in jaguar parts linked to the ayahuasca tourism industry, happens not only in Peru but throughout the Amazon region including in Colombia and Ecuador.  âIt has slowed down during the pandemic but it will be back with a vengeance,â he said.  âNaive backpackers believe that a jaguar canine, for example, will bring added power and a stronger high to their ayahuasca journey. But they donât think about what it means - to get that canine, a mother jaguar may have been killed, leaving cubs and reducing population numbers.â  Glue paste for arthritis and 'bone' wine  Jaguar parts are used in traditional medicines that claim to treat a host of ailments from arthritis pain to boosting sexual performance.  An investigation, conducted in 2018 by World Animal Protection (WAP) in Suriname, found âa highly secretive hunting and trading chainâ where jaguars could be tracked for days before being shot multiple times.  Roberto Vieto, global campaign manager of Wildlife Not Pets World Animal Protection, told The Independent: âOur investigation in Suriname exposes the extreme cruelty involved in the illegal wildlife trade of jaguar parts, which transforms the largest feline of the Americas into a glue-like paste product (with no scientific-proved benefits), their fangs into souvenirs, and in some cases, jaguar cubs into exotic pets kept in terrible conditions.â  Almost half of Suriname citizens live in poverty and the illegal trade in jaguars is a lucrative means of support.  The investigation found that carcasses were sold by local hunters to Chinese middlemen for around $260, which were then marked up to $2,000-$3,000 in larger urban areas.  Jaguar carcasses were also being chopped and boiled into a glue-like black paste to apparently treat arthritis, researchers noted. Dozens of tubs were being smuggled out of Suriname to Asia, where each one sold for $785- $3,000. Jaguar penises were also being illegally shipped as a product to enhance virility.  Jaguar teeth and claws, some set in gold, were found by investigators in markets around Surinameâs capital Paramaribo. A tooth set in gold could fetch up to $1,200.  Jaguar carcasses are also sought by Chinese and Filipino communities in Suriname for meat and the bones used to make wine, according to the study.  Mr Vieto said that more must be done to elevate the status of the jaguar as critically important to diverse ecosystems.  âAdditional efforts should be placed to educate about the ecological value of the species in their natural habitat, improving the coexistence to reduce the conflict with wild animals, and discourage completely the use of wild animal parts as medicine and substitute this by sustainable herbal alternatives,â he said.  At an international level, there is a growing recognition that more must be done to protect jaguars. They are currently listed as âNearly Threatenedâ on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List though their status may be elevated to âvulnerableâ due to recent trends.  In 2018, 14 countries where the jaguar roams, along with international conservation groups, Panthera, World Wildlife Fund, Wildlife Conservation Society, and the United Nations Development Programme, came together with an ambitious plan to secure a âJaguar Corridorâ, stretching from Mexico to Argentina, and involving 30 priority conservation landscapes for the big cats by 2030.  âThe jaguar is an icon for Latin America and a clear reminder of our indigenous heritage, we need to strive to mobilize people to stand up and defend the home we share,â MarÃ­a JosÃ© Villanueva, WWF Mexico Conservation Director, said of the plan.",https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/illegal-wildlife-trade-jaguars-latin-america-amazon-ayahuasca-a9646911.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,502859b122da429986001c17961e6f505d03b25306e729215bcbe926cb69b58e,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The Met Office said the very hot and dry conditions developing across southern areas will start to sweep warm air northwards from the continent on Thursday, after a cloudy start for most.

Saturday will likely be another hot day for southern and central parts of the UK, with heatwave conditions possibly being met in parts of southeast England and East Anglia,â he added.  31 July was the hottest day of the year so far, with the highest temperature recorded at 37.8C in Heathrow. The Coastguard reported its busiest day for more than four years as it dealt with over 300 incidents and has warned people planning to visit a beach or the coast to âfollow beach safety adviceâ.  Gareth Morrison, RNLI head of water safety, said: âOur coastline is a fantastic place to spend time together as a family, especially when the sun is out and itâs hot.  âBut there are also plenty of potential dangers, especially for those who arenât fully aware of their surroundings and may be visiting a particular beach for the first time.â  The very hot conditions are expected to last until Sunday, but may even continue until Monday as result of southerly winds moving from Europe and parts of northern Africa.  Councils across the country jointly issued a plea for members of the public to maintain social distancing and keep an eye on vulnerable or elderly family and friends during the heatwave.  The Local Government Association (LGA) said in a statement: âThe ârush to the sunâ following easing of lockdown restrictions in recent weeks has become a serious challenge for councils responsible for beach safety.

Councillor Richard Kemp, vice chair of the LGAâs Community Wellbeing Board, added: âPeople will understandably want to enjoy the sunshine. However, when large numbers of people head to the coast and tourist spots there is inevitably a risk of overcrowding and an increase in the rate at which Covid-19 could be transmitted.  âLives depend on all of us taking personal responsibility for our actions to avoid a resurgence of this deadly virus that puts further lives at risk.â",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-weather-news-forecast-met-office-heatwave-temperatures-beach-a9656496.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,ae229a50116cef881ad074fe6eb2da2a4f642dde5720b0cf72e010aa449a582e,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

I was incredibly irritated when the prime minister finally announced that masks would be compulsory in shops here in England. Not because I donât think we should all be wearing them, but because it was long overdue.  I was frustrated by the angry âno maskâ brigade. They seemed to have no regard at all for helping to protect their fellow citizens from a potentially lethal disease. Apparently their âfreedomâ trumped all else.  I have been wearing a mask in supermarkets and other shops here in the UK since my return from Singapore on 24 May. I came home armed with a box of 50 because they were so much more plentiful â and cheaper â over there.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Back in mid-February, I made a last-minute decision to go to Singapore to visit an old university friend. So it was pure coincidence that I found myself in the safest part of the world, where they knew what to do and acted with great speed to aggressively suppress the lethal virus.  By contrast, Europe and the US ignored and downplayed the threat â and they unsurprisingly became the epicentre of the pandemic from early March. I was in no rush to return to the unfolding disaster in the UK. Ignoring the Foreign Secretaryâs call for Brits to return home, I kept rescheduling my BA return flight to London, originally booked for 8 March.  There were only 385 cases in total on 20 March, but newly imported cases due to Singaporeans and permanent residents returning home from Europe and the US had led to a modest rise in infections, despite the issued 14-day âstay at homeâ notices for new arrivals. The government quickly moved to enforce quarantine in designated hotels.  We began a preemptive semi-lockdown on 7 April â very similar to the UK lockdown, it included closures of businesses and schools, and asking people to stay home â as Singaporeâs prime minister Lee Hsien Loong told the nation that he wanted to âstamp out the virusâ and limit new cases to fewer than 10 a day.  New clusters in cramped foreign workersâ dormitories â housing around 300,000 â meant lockdown was extended to early June. All the dorms were quarantined while a huge targeted dorm testing programme allowed healthy workers to be moved to alternative accommodation such as vacant apartment blocks.

Masks played a key role in the cityâs fight against the spread of the virus from the beginning. By mid-April, they became compulsory and there were pick-up points for all citizens to collect a free washable mask if they wished.  At first, I was far from delighted. Like most Brits, I had never worn a mask before and it felt and looked incredibly strange. Worse than that, I could barely breathe. But within a few days I was over it. âMasking upâ soon became as natural as slipping on my sunglasses and flip flops. And that was in the searing heat and humidity of Singaporeâs tropical climate.  We have it easy here in the UK as it is only mandatory in shops and on public transport. In Singapore they were mandatory everywhere outside of the home, including outdoors, unless you were doing vigorous exercise.  Singapore achieved its goal of very low community cases by mid-May but waited until the beginning of June to start to ease out of lockdown. Shops and restaurants only reopened on 19 June and the countryâs borders remain tightly shut to this day to everyone but their own returning residents or essential business travellers from a tiny number of countries. Everyone must quarantine for 14 days upon arrival.  They are advising against any travel from Singapore, instead encouraging locals to staycation and support their own tourist sector. Bars and other places where âsafe distancingâ is impossible are still closed and large gatherings were the first to be banned and will remain so indefinitely.  Their test, trace and isolate strategy, brilliant from the beginning, is now even better. We were temperature checked and required to hand over contact details when entering shops and restaurants back in mid-March. But during lockdown, they rolled out a new super fast high tech contact tracing system so it would be fully functional before restrictions are eased. This involved checking in and out of a supermarket or pharmacy by scanning a giant barcode â each one unique to the shop â using our mobile and providing our contact details digitally. Before lockdown ended, every shop and restaurant had to instal the new system.  From the very beginning, Singapore was testing everyone with symptoms, isolating them, and doing the same to all contacts. No one was discharged from hospital or isolation without two negative tests over 24 hours. The care homes truly had a protective ring around them. In comparison, the care home disaster in the UK is nothing less than a national scandal.  I finally returned to London on 24 May, sobbing into my mask on touchdown at Heathrow. I had grown so fond of Singapore and its people that I had not wanted to leave. By then wearing a mask non-stop from the moment I got into my taxi to Changi Airport, right through to exiting Heathrow airport, for a total of around 18 hours, was second nature to me.  There can be no doubt that masks are a crucial tool in the war against the virus. Singapore had one new community case on 28 July. But mask wearing remains compulsory for everyone outside of their homes.  Singapore may be much smaller, but 27 deaths, in total, is an incredible achievement. They simply got it right. They learned from the Sars epidemic and were prepared and ready to spring into action.  If weâd followed Singaporeâs example, we could have saved many thousands of lives. We now know that the UKâs epidemic was imported from Spain and Italy due to a shambolic failure to impose strict border controls or enforced quarantine from those countries in March, when they lost control of the virus. That was one of the UKâs catastrophic mistakes. Letâs not make the same mistakes again  Melissa Jacobs is a freelance journalist with a background in biological sciences.

It proposes among other issues ââ¦ a further tightening of the rules on EU ivory tradeâ while nonetheless maintaining a thriving ivory market itself.  Double Standards  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  âA further tightening of the rules â¦â is hardly progress.  Under the Juncker Commission, which left office on 30th November 2019, significant strides were being made to close the loopholes in the EUâs ivory trade.  The Von der Leyen âGreen Dealâ Commission has, however, demonstrated scant political will to maintain - let alone increase - that momentum. It is this type of double standard that we can no longer stand for.  âWe are tired of these lectures that constantly come from the North, telling us how to manage our spaces while they ignore the implications of their actions. Frankly, the EU has failed to read the mood across the world,â says Dr Winnie Kiiru, Senior Technical Advisor for the Elephant Protection Initiative Foundation (EPI), an organisation comprising of 21 African countries working to secure the protection of African elephants.  As an elephant biologist for the past 20 years, Kiiru has fought for the ban of ivory across the world and is not impressed by the EUâs double standards. âCountries that had thriving markets such as China and the US have gone ahead to ban ivory trade - it seems very odd that the EU wonât follow suit.â  Beginning around 2007, a wave of poaching for ivory devastated populations of savanna and forest elephants across Africa. The total numbers of savanna elephants decreased by 30% between 2007 and 2015, while forest elephants were hit even harder.  In some countries, elephant populations declined by over 50% in under 10 years. If current poaching levels continue, elephants may be extinct in the wild within the decade â and this will be thanks in no small measure to the EUâs ivory market, among the largest in the world.  Poaching of African elephants continues unabated. The fight for countries to shut down the international ivory trade has borne some fruit with key nations such as the USA, UK and China responding to global pressure and closing their domestic ivory markets.  This action has been accompanied by a decrease in poaching within some parts of Africa, primarily in East Africa. However, in other regions, notably West, Central and Southern Africa, the poaching trend has not declined.  If anything, poaching levels are increasing in new hotspots, as major global ivory markets have remained open, notably those of Japan and the European Union.  This makes the EUâs Biodiversity Strategy, as part of the highly ambitious Green Deal suite of policy initiatives all the more extraordinary.  Aiming to provide âguidanceâ to African countries on steps to take in order to maintain and improve our biodiversity, it is supremely ironic that the EUâs ivory market is effectively a key contributor of the destruction of Africaâs natural heritage.  Laundering âlegalâ ivory into the illegal market. It is all the more surprising to note this somewhat misguided act of charity has no roots within the EU.  The European Commission continues to maintain that the EUâs ivory market deals only with old ivory stocks and has no influence on current poaching levels.  Yet, recent studies have shown that ivory pieces can be aged and made to seem older than they actually are. Limiting the trade to small ivory pieces is also no solution, as carving operations have now been established in elephant range states.  This ongoing consumption of ivory puts the safety of the African elephants at great risk because, by giving ivory a value it prolongs demand, which maintains the push for supply.  Until the EU shuts down its domestic market, ivory will continue to be laundered into European markets under the guise of being âold or small stockâ.  âThe EU needs to appreciate the role of any African market in increasing the cost of law enforcement in African countries and destroying livelihoods. Furthermore, their strategy will be impossible to realize in Africa until they shut down their ivory markets,â Kiiru maintains.  Critically, ivory has no value within Africa; it is only countries outside that continue to clamour for it and by so doing fuel poaching across the continent.  And so, however good the intentions were in writing the EU Biodiversity Strategy, I am reminded of a song my mother would sing: âSweep your yard before you come and sweep mineâ. This is precisely what the EU needs to do.  The time for decisive action is now. Overall, the importance of healthy elephant populations is to increase and help support our African biodiversity, and they are part of our cultural heritage.  We cannot afford to lose them for the sake of demand by foreigners in Europe and elsewhere for trinkets.  Again it remains clear, the EU needs to re-examine its so-called âroleâ in promoting global biodiversity; here in Africa, what it does in reality is continue to endanger African elephants.

Netflix's hit series returned on Friday (31 July), and was soon criticised by many viewers for including a seemingly corrupt organisation whose evil boss, known as The Handler, is shown speaking Yiddish.  Yiddish is the language almost exclusively spoken by Ashkenazi Jews.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  âThe accusation of antisemitism in The Umbrella Academy is hurtful and, more importantly, factually incorrect,â co-creator Steve Blackman said.  Blackman â who is Jewish â said that he âwrote these episodesâ and âcreated the characterâ, adding: ""While I understand audiences sometimes receive things in a different way than creators intend, The Handler was not created as an antisemitic character.â  He also said that the organisation at the centre of the show, known as The Commission, is ânot evilâ.  âThey do not control finances, governments, or the media,â Blackman said. âThe only thing they control â and more importantly, protect â is the timeline of our fictional Umbrella Academy universe.â  The Handler â played by Kate Walsh â also appeared in the first season, which prompted The Board of Deputies of British Jews to write an open letter against the series back in 2019.  âThe use of a Yiddish saying by the evil boss of an organisation which controls the worldâs timeline is clearly an anti-Semitic trope,â Amanda Bowman, Vice President of the board, wrote.  âWhether intentional or not, this makes for very uncomfortable viewing. Netflix should take action to remove the racism from this scene.â  Following the controversy, fans were shocked to see that the character was still using the language in new episodes.  One viewer said they believed its inclusion to be âdeliberateâ when considering the uproar it caused in 2019.  In season two, The Handler can also be seen speaking Mandarin and Swedish, something Blackman addressed in his response to the criticism: âThe Handler speaks every language, including Swedish, Mandarin, Yiddish, and English.â  However, one viewer said this begs the question: âWhy have her speak Yiddish when she could speak ANY other language?â  TikTok user @nyarchivist accused the show of âantisemitic dog whistlingâ in a video about the series.  âHaving the villain speak that language is [saying], âLook at these big Jewish villains, arenât they vile, look at their gross language.â That is what it is. That is what itâs always been, because society is built on believing that Jewish people control everything. That is antisemitism.â  Another viewer added: âI donât know what to tell you, The Umbrella Academy having the âsecret world domination cultâ speaking Yiddish is definitely, intentionally antisemitic.â  The Umbrella Academy, which first aired in 2019, is an adaptation of My Chemical Romance singer Gerard Wayâs comic book series of the same name.  Starring Ellen Page and Robert Sheehan, the series follows a family of disparate former child heroes who reunite to protect the world.  Netflix denied The Independentâs request for comment.

2020-08-06 13:20:00.394197,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 10:11:00 GMT",Can I go on holiday this summer and will I have to quarantine?,"For many, it felt like summer was cancelled as soon as Matt Hancock said as much on ITVâs This Morning back in early May.  âI think thatâs likely to be the case,â the health secretary answered when asked if sunny season would be off the agenda for the first time since the Second World War.  But there are now glimmers of hope that something could be salvaged as Britainâs lockdown restrictions continue to ease. Here are your questions answered...  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Will I be able to go on holiday this summer?  Yes, if you want. Itâs contingent on several factors: the Foreign Office travel warning being lifted; the host country being willing to accept tourists from the UK; no quarantine being imposed upon arrival or return to the UK; and the ability to fly or otherwise travel to your chosen destination.  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) issued a blanket warning against all non-essential international travel back in March, but this was lifted for 67 destinations as of 4 July. The list is subject to change at any time â more recently, a further 19 destinations were added, while others, including Spain, were removed without warning.  Meanwhile, the mandatory two-week quarantine for all inbound arrivals, which started on 8 June, has also been scrapped as of 10 July for those travelling from a separate list of approved countries and territories into England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland published its own list of destinations, although the two are currently identical. Five countries were recently added across both, while Serbia and Spain were removed from the Department for Transportâs list (they were never on Scotlandâs in the first place). Luxembourg also got the boot after a surge in coronavirus cases.  Although the FCO and quarantine-exempt lists of countries are not the same, at present a number of places can be found across both, meaning that holidays to these destinations might be feasible again (although thereâs no guarantee the countries in question will let Brits in).  After nearly three months of staying completely grounded, easyJet operated its first post-lockdown flight on 15 June (a domestic service to Glasgow), and other airlines followed suit â though nowhere near pre-coronavirus levels, there are now regular flights to most destinations that UK travellers are free to visit.  You might think that, as the âsick man of Europeâ, Britons wonât be welcome elsewhere; but for a number of countries, UK visitors make up a significant proportion of their tourism market overall, and theyâre keen to have us back. Spain, for example, opened its doors to British holidaymakers as of 21 June, without the need to self-isolate on arrival.  Italy reopened its borders for travellers from the UK and the 26 EU member states as of 3 June, and Croatia has been inviting tourists in since May. Click here for a full list of destinations with no travel restrictions for British holidaymakers.  Will I have to quarantine when I get there?  This largely depends on the country in question. Quarantining is generally implemented in countries with a low infection rate for people arriving from a country with a high infection rate (although this didnât hold true in the UKâs case). For example, New Zealand is âclosed to almost all travellersâ and demands that all arrivals self-isolate for two weeks. The country has one of the lowest infection rates in the world and a Covid-19 death toll of just 22 overall.  However, there are already a number of countries that will allow British holidaymakers in without any quarantine requirements, including France, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Germany, Poland, Croatia, Belgium, Sweden and Switzerland.  Click here to see The Independentâs full list of countries youâre free to travel to without the need to be tested or quarantine on arrival.  Will I have to quarantine when I come home?  For most countries, yes â a 14-day quarantine was introduced on 8 June for all arrivals into the UK, including Brits returning from abroad.  The quarantine was put in place indefinitely, but the government has relaxed the rules as of 10 July for certain countries and territories regarded as âlow-riskâ by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, which was set up to coordinate the governmentâs response to the pandemic.  The list of exempt countries is subject to change, and is being reviewed on a weekly basis. There are currently more than 60 exempt countries, including France, Italy, Croatia, Greece and Turkey.  Will anything be open if I go abroad?  It depends on where you go, but in most cases, yes. Plenty of countries across Europe are easing lockdown measures, with non-essential shops and attractions reopening.  For instance, in Venice, the famed Dogeâs Palace reopened on 13 June, along with most souvenir shops, cafes and restaurants. The Leaning Tower of Pisa opened at the start of June.  Many attractions in France and Spain are open, including the palace at Versailles and the Guggenheim in Bilbao, though social-distancing, the limiting of visitor numbers and advance online bookings are generally required.  Just check your specific region before travelling â as new Covid-19 flare-ups occur, measures are being reintroduced on a localised basis, meaning services could shut again or other restrictions could be imposed.  Iâm booked but no longer want to go â can I get a refund?  Where a tour operator has cancelled your package holiday, youâre entitled to a full refund within 14 days (though in reality itâs likely to be a much longer wait).  However, if your holiday is still scheduled to go ahead, pulling out now would mean you forfeit any money youâve already paid out, as your cancellation falls under âdisinclination to travelâ.  If you have particular health concerns it might be worth getting in touch with your travel insurance provider, although many of them have changed their terms and conditions to disallow any claims associated with Covid-19.  Contacting the holiday provider and asking to rebook for a later date next year might be your best bet. Tui is offering anyone booked up to 31 August 2020 to postpone without penalty.  Those who have booked separate flights and accommodation will find it much harder to get a refund if they cancel â the airline has no obligation to refund you if the flight goes ahead, even if the FCO advises against travel to your destination.  Can I go on staycation?  From 4 July, up to two households have been allowed to stay overnight together âin self-contained accommodationâ, as long as social distancing guidelines are followed.  Many English hotels reopened on 4 July, complete with stringent new cleaning measures.  Just be aware that things might be a little different â breakfast buffets are likely to be scrapped, while spas could require guests to get changed in their rooms to avoid overcrowding of changing rooms.  However, recently reinstated lockdown rules in parts of the north of England mean people visiting family or friends in the affected areas are not allowed to stay in their homes or the same accommodation, such as a self-catering apartment, together (unless they have previously formed a support bubble).  Northern Ireland was a day ahead, with hotels, pubs, restaurants and tourist attractions all able to open with suitable social-distancing measures from 3 July.  Scotland reopened its tourist industry on 15 July; Aberdeen is currently experiencing a local lockdown, with people told not to travel there and residents banned from travelling more than five miles from home for leisure purposes. Travel restrictions in Wales were lifted from 6 July and self-contained accommodation has been permitted to re-open as of 13 July.  Up until 17 July, anyone without a car was pretty stuck when it came to domestic travel, as the government advised against all ânon-essentialâ public transport journeys. But Boris Johnson has now said travelling by public transport is permitted throughout England, whatever the reason for your journey.  How can I stay safe while travelling?  At the risk of sounding like a broken record, itâs the standard: âWash your hands regularly for 20 secondsâ advice. This is particularly important while in transit â at the airport and on a flight, train or ferry â because youâre coming into contact with a lot of new people. Take hand sanitiser with you where possible, as itâs easier than requesting permission to go to the loo to wash your hands (now necessary on a Ryanair flight). Wear a mask in enclosed spaces, and steer clear of anyone coughing or otherwise looking unwell.  If you really want to minimise human contact during the journey, opting to drive is probably the most effective means of avoiding others.  Will it be expensive to go on holiday this summer?  Holiday companies attempting to entice travellers are still proffering deals â Jet2 Holidays, for example, is offering a week to Corfu from Â£239pp, including flights and transfers, departing 11 September.  But those booking separate flights and accommodation as opposed to packages may find air fares are pricier than normal due to reduced capacity.  The Independentâs travel correspondent Simon Calder noted of easyJetâs first flight after being grounded for 11 weeks during the pandemic: âFares on the few flights that are operating can be punishingly high: I paid Â£175 for the one-hour hop [to Glasgow].â  Currently the demand for self-contained accommodation in the UK is very high, with prices to match, so you may actually get a better deal by booking somewhere abroad.  Can I get travel insurance to cover coronavirus?  Yes â more policies covering coronavirus are becoming available.  Both Trailfinders and Allianz Assistance are selling policies that cover customers for both holiday disruption/cancellation caused by coronavirus, and medical expenses should you contract the virus abroad.  Staysure says: âIf you develop Covid-19 while on holiday and need help, youâll be covered as long as you have declared your pre-existing conditions.â Saga is also offering medical coronavirus cover.  However, most providers are excluding cover for Covid-19 on all new policies. One of the largest providers, Columbus Direct, says: âWe are no longer able to offer cover for claims arising from, or related to, coronavirus.â  Policies bought before mid-March may still cover you for coronavirus-related claims. If you have an annual policy, your insurer may or may not allow you to renew with the same degree of cover.  Travelling against Foreign Office travel advice invalidates standard travel insurance policies (it is possible to pay through the nose for âwar zoneâ insurance policies that will cover you).  For visits within the European Union, the EHIC scheme is still in operation for British travellers to the end of the year and will provide medical treatment on the same basis as local people in public hospitals across the EU.  Is it safe to go abroad?  Itâs completely dependent on where you go. Many countries in Europe have managed to flatten the curve and reduce coronavirus infection rates far more successfully than the UK by using methods like early lockdown and comprehensive track and trace programmes. In fact, with the worldâs third-highest death rate, it could be argued that the UK is a riskier place to be than many other countries.  Itâs worth being vigilant at the airport and on the aircraft (or train, boat or any other preferred mode of transport) â taking measures such as regular hand washing and wearing a face covering â and likewise while abroad if you venture into busy, enclosed spaces. But in many cases being on holiday shouldnât be any more dangerous than being in the UK, especially now that non-essential shops and other amenities are opening up here again.",https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/summer-holidays-faqs-quarantine-coronavirus-safe-flights-travel-a9567196.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,1166204d9c19cb50254295da3c15ceb981e4871102819535ee124e2875d4be70,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The report linked to similar campaigns across Facebook and Twitter, which were uncovered in an investigation by social media analytics firm Graphika in April.  Disinformation campaigns plagued social media platforms in the build up to the 2016 US presidential elections, most notably from Russian state-linked actors.  With less than three months to go until the 2020 elections, Facebook, Google and Twitter are attempting to avoid past mistakes by cracking down on foreign interference.  Speaking at a 2018 Congressional hearing, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said: ""We found ourselves unprepared and ill-equipped for the immensity of the problems we've acknowledged.""  Both Facebook and Twitter have also deleted accounts linked to malicious actors in response to Graphika's April report.  Privacy advocates called for greater oversight to ensure that any content being removed is genuinely harmful.  ""The chances that Google could be influenced by the US government in order to take down content it doesnât agree with is concerning, and it is important to consider who gets to decide what is taken down and why,"" Ray Walsh, digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy told The Independent.

Not since the great Stephen Hendry achieved the feat back in 2012 had a player compiled a maximum but four-time world champion Higgins ended the eight-year wait in style, as a brilliant visit against Kurt Maflin secured the tenth 147 of his career.  Cliff Thorburn was the first to accomplish the feat in 1983 while Jimmy White, Ronnie OâSullivan, Mark Williams, Ali Carter and Hendry followed suit over the next 29 years and it was Higgins who became the latest snooker immortal behind closed doors.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  The table looked promising from the very beginning, as the world No.5 expertly bridged over the pack of reds to rack up his first point in the bottom right pocket.  And from there he found that brilliant fluency thatâs seen him romp to 30 ranking event titles, potting red, black, red, black in mesmerising fashion to cue anticipation of the unthinkable.  Tom Ford, Stuart Bingham and Maflin himself came close to achieving the feat in their first round matches but it was Higgins who looked the best-placed to go all the way, with the reds favourably distributed at the bottom end of the table.  A brilliant pot into the middle pocket on the penultimate red paved the way and once Higgins got onto the colours, there was no looking back.  He held his nerve with aplomb to add his name to a glittering roll call of former players, his tenth maximum of his career and his first at the Crucible to further his status as a World Championship great.

To support us, please consider a contribution.  50 million face masks that were meant to be used by the NHS now cannot be worn by staff because of safety issues, the government has admitted.  The FFP2 masks ordered by the government have ear loops instead of head loops, meaning there is a risk they would not be secure enough.  The masks were supplied by Ayanda Capital, who was awarded a Â£252 million contract to supply personal protective equipment (PPE).

Mr Horlick said Mr Mills was a business associate and he was asked to help the firm âgiven his relationship with the Department for International Trade and his experience in international business and salesâ.  Mr Mills previously held senior leadership positions in businesses including Samsung, IBM, HP and KPMG, said the document.  The government insisted that âappropriate due diligenceâ was undertaken on Ayanda Capital and the Chinese factories it used to manufacture the PPE, and âthe companyâs track record indicated it would be capable of fulfilling a large order of medical masksâ.  Jolyon Maugham, director of Good Law Project, said organisation wrote to the government regarding three contracts, each worth over Â£100 million, awarded to a pest control company, a confectioner, and Ayanda Capital.  âEach of those contracts has revealed a real cause for alarm â including, on Ayanda, that around Â£150 million was spent on unusable masks. What other failures remain undiscovered?â she said.  Julia Patterson, founder of EveryDoctor, added: âIt is horrifying that during the worst criss in the NHSâ history, the government entrusted large sums of public money in the hands of companies with no experience in producing safe PPE for healthcare workers.

Girl Meets World ran from 2014 to 2017 on the childrenâs TV channel, and focused on the adventures of school girl Riley Matthews (Rowan Blanchard) and her father and schoolteacher, Cory (Ben Savage).

The clip from the episode, which now has been viewed more than three million times, sees Cory lecture the girls about the need for individualism.  âWhen you get everything right, but you donât do it yourselves, it makes you average,â he says. ââAâ divided by three is a âCâ.

To support us, please consider a contribution.  I watched with an all too familiar sense of horror as yet another TV programme hit the screens with unrelenting messages about weight loss. This time it was Dr Michael Mosleyâs Channel 4 programme, How to Lose A Stone in 21 Days. As someone who was in hospital for a year with anorexia, it brought so many destructive feelings flooding back.  Of course, I totally get that some people benefit from losing weight. And I understand why the government has launched its anti-obesity strategy. But what I donât get is why the messages are so overwhelmingly negative. Itâs all so restrictive - cut back on calories, lose weight. Thereâs nothing balanced about it. Why arenât we talking more positively about food and the good calories we need to consume?  Being so one-sided in these communications (which are not just reaching people classed as obese, but also the 1.25 million Brits who are struggling with eating disorders) will do more harm than good. Itâs like asking somebody struggling with anorexia to binge on calories. Surely more positive messages about food will help those of us who need to gain, as well as lose weight? And not only that, a more positive relationship with food will surely be a more sustainable one? One that is neutral.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  The programme began immediately with references to âlockdown bellyâ, shaming people who may have put weight on. We are in a pandemic - changes in weight should not be something we are beating ourselves up over. One person made reference to being lonely and that had caused her to increase her weight. Another person was experiencing grief. Perhaps we should be looking at those symptoms and dealing with wider issues not only focusing on the individualâs weight.  Lockdown has created a perfect storm for people with eating disorders, and it is these people that are likely to tune in to programmes like this. Listening to Dr Mosley and his wife giving tips on losing weight, and how to fill up on other things, was heart-breaking. I thought back to the girl I was 11 years ago who would have been sitting there listening and making note of all this.  The governmentâs obesity strategy communicates its aims in a similarly destructive way. Thereâs so much emphasis on counting calories and listing them on menus. This can be triggering for people struggling with disordered eating. I know this first hand as, when I was a teenager and at the height of my illness, counting calories was a major part of my life. Itâs a habit that is incredibly difficult to get out of, and seeing its message reinforced time and again only serves to trigger those experiences and behaviours. Not only this, but it normalises conversations about calories which can be extremely dangerous for people with eating disorders.  You might argue that people struggling with eating disorders are only a small proportion of the population. Thatâs true, but the impact on their lives is significant. Anorexia is just one type of eating disorder, but it has a mortality rate of 10 per cent, which is incredibly high. Unbalanced messaging that feeds into the behaviours that drive the illness is therefore incredibly dangerous. But even within the wider population, I still believe the messages for people trying to lose weight could be more considered. We have created a world where disordered eating is the norm and this in itself is extremely dangerous.  Why not take a more holistic, less black and white approach to tackling the obesity crisis? The current conversation about calories and weight are landing within a context of diet culture and fat shaming - where unrealistic body image is the norm. Combined, this creates a toxic problem that could do far more harm than good. Are we really okay with creating a world where it feels impossible for so many to recover from eating disorders? And where children are going to walk into a restaurant and be faced with calories on menus?  I urge the government to reconsider its strategy and incorporate more positive messaging. To provide a more rounded approach to educating people about food and a balanced diet, starting with schools and community groups, working with food banks to ensure that they have healthy food for families and that people know how to cook with them. And to consider providing more focus on the good things we can and should eat, rather than simply focusing on consuming less.  For some people, what they eat, when and how much can be driven by their mood and mental health. Learning how to understand the links between mental health and eating habits could also be a significant step forward and wouldnât need a focus on numbers.  My message is not to stop obese people getting help. Itâs not to stop the governmentâs anti-obesity campaign. I just want to see a more considered, nuanced approach that recognises the complexities involved in our relationship with food. After all, we need more of the good stuff to survive and thrive.

The first episode of Lose a Stone in 21 Days with Michael Mosley aired on Channel 4 on Wednesday 5 August.

In response to Lose a Stone in 21 Days, Caroline Price, director of services at Beat, said in a statement sent to The Independent that it was âincredibly worrying to see a national programme yet again promoting extreme weight loss and crash dietingâ.  âThe promise inherent in the title is likely to attract people suffering from or vulnerable to eating disorders and risks encouraging those affected to attempt the methods shown despite the damage this could cause,â Ms Price said.  âResearch has shown that dietary restraint, including the restriction of calories, has been found to be a risk factor in the development of an eating disorder.â  Ms Price said that while the show âdid not appear to look after the participantsâ mental health in any wayâ, such as by having participants take part in consultations with a psychiatrist, âit did have an alarming focus on the participantsâ weight, BMI and measurements, as well as encouraging them to carry out activities that we know those affected by eating disorders may engage in, such as destroying food to avoid eating it or fixating on eating a restricted number of caloriesâ.  The Beat director of services said that the charity âwrote to Channel 4 in advance of the programme voicing our concerns and providing guidance on reporting in a responsible and non-triggering wayâ.  However, Ms Price said that the programme caused âenough stress and anxiety to our beneficiariesâ that it decided to extend its helpline hours while the show was on air, resulting in â51 per cent more contact during that timeâ.  âIt is very disappointing that once again, their needs have been ignored by broadcasters,â she stated.  In a statement sent to The Independent, Channel 4 said: âThroughout the series it is clear that it is in no way promoting eating disorders, vanity or body shaming. Instead it examines the evidenced link between Covid-19 and the very real threat it poses to those who have a BMI putting them in the obese or overweight categories.  âA recent study led by Liverpool University, and involving Imperial College London, found obese people are around 37 per cent more likely to die if they catch Covid-19. Research has found a short-term 800-1000 calorie diet has the potential to reverse a range of health problems including Type-2 Diabetes.  âThis diet is inspired by a recent Oxford University study and all episodes clearly state itâs only suitable for people whose BMI puts them in the overweight or obese categories and that it should be done with proper medical supervision.â  If you have been affected by this article, you can contact eating disorder charity Beat for support by calling the helpline on 0808 801 0677, the studentline on 0808 801 0811 or the youthline on 0808 801 0711.

2020-08-06 13:20:03.758219,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 09:55:00 GMT",Coronavirus: How to stay safe on a flight,"With international travel feasible again as of 10 July, when certain countries were made exempt from mandatory quarantine for travellers entering the UK, it may not be too long before weâre airborne.  But, for the foreseeable future, catching a flight is likely to be a very different experience compared to pre-Covid times.  From social distancing and wearing masks at the airport to limited food and no queuing for the toilet on planes, measures aimed at minimising the spread of coronavirus are being introduced.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  But just how risky is flying? And is there any way to guarantee safety? Hereâs everything you need to know.  How should I get to the airport?  Before you even arrive at the airport, thereâs the getting to the airport bit to consider. Public transport carries a greater risk of coming into contact with new people and surfaces touched by others â and therefore a greater risk of coming into contact with coronavirus â than travelling by car.  However, as The Independentâs esteemed travel correspondent, Simon Calder, would point out, driving or getting a taxi carries its own risks: road traffic accidents claim around 1,800 lives in the UK every year.  Essentially, every mode of transport carries some kind of risk. But if your main concern right now is catching Covid-19, a car is probably the best way to go (being sure to wear a mask, keep the window open and wash your hands beforehand if youâre catching a cab).  How can I stay safe at the airport?  At the airport itself, new measures have been introduced, such as social distancing and mandatory face coverings for passengers and staff.  Although travellers often fixate on planes as a hotbed of germs, the airport is potentially a much more risky proposition, bringing together as it does people from all over the world.  Keeping your distance from those outside your household, regular hand washing or using hand sanitiser, and wearing a mask are the most important steps to take. But there are other ways to limit contact with others too: check in and print off your boarding pass in advance where possible, and limit yourself to hand luggage if you can.  This is at odds with the Department for Transport (DfT) advice, which on 11 June recommended passengers check in all baggage, saying: âThis will speed up boarding and disembarking and minimise the risk of transmission.â  The intention was to reduce the amount of standing and waiting in the airport aisle.  However, Ryanair has a different take, arguing that taking hand luggage reduces the number of hands your bag passes through by a substantial amount, cutting out various baggage handlers on either side of the journey.

Even though, clearly, we make more money out of checked-in bags.  âOur logic has always been that checked-in bags are handled by eight pairs of hands, from the check-in desk to the boarding gate, all the way through to the arrival airport as well â whereas a carry-on bag the passenger keeps with them at all times.â  Avoiding checked-in luggage also means you donât have to congregate around the baggage carousel with lots of other people after your flight. This means youâre better able to follow the DfTâs other piece of advice: âLeave the airport as quickly as possible.â  There are risks either way â but airlines have made it very clear they will not be reducing their, at times hefty, rates for checking in a bag.  Elsewhere, trays at security are often a hotbed of bacteria at airports as they pass through so many different hands each day. (A study conducted in 2016 even suggested the trays are home to more respiratory viruses than public toilets.) After youâve gone through security and removed your items from the trays provided, ensure you sanitise or wash your hands as soon as possible, being sure not to touch your face in the meantime.  How can I stay safe on the aircraft?  On board the aircraft, the DfT advises passengers to: remain seated as much as possible; follow instructions and guidance from crew; use contactless payment where possible; be aware there is likely to be a reduced food and drink service; and make the cabin crew aware if you become ill.  Most airlines will require you to wear a mask onboard when not eating or drinking, and will provide hand sanitiser. Some, such as Qatar Airways, are even making passengers wear face shields as well as masks.  If youâre flying short-haul, going to the toilet just before boarding could help eliminate the need to go while on the aircraft, meaning less movement around the cabin and less chance of coming into contact with a coronavirus carrier.  Both Ryanair and easyJet have announced new policies to avoid queues for the toilet forming in the aisle â but not going at all carries the lowest risk.  This may seem like hair splitting, but studies have shown that those who move a lot around the cabin are more likely to pick up a bug.  In a 2018 study tracking the âbehaviours, movements and transmission of droplet-mediated respiratory diseases during transcontinental airline flightsâ, a research team led by Atlantaâs Emory University found that those in window seats had far fewer encounters with other passengers than people in other seats.  This is due in large part to the fact that those by the window were less likely to get up from their seat, with just 43 per cent moving around the aircraft compared to 80 per cent of people in aisle seats â meaning they were less likely to come into contact with potential virus carriers.  One of the studyâs diagrams showed the likelihood of travellers coming into contact with one designated infectious passenger based on where theyâre sitting. Other than those sitting on the same row as patient zero, all window seat passengers had a 5 per cent or less chance of coming into contact. Most had a 0-1 per cent probability, far lower than their middle and aisle seat counterparts.  Opting to take a window seat could, therefore, lower your risk of catching something â but the most important thing to remember is that the less you move around the plane, the lower the likelihood of you coming into contact with a virus carrier.  Are planes more dangerous than other modes of transport because of the air circulating?  The same study mentioned above highlighted that the risk of catching something on a plane is pretty low.  The probability of actually being infected by âpatient zeroâ was just 0-1 per cent for the vast majority of all passengers, apart from those sitting on the same row or across the aisle.  Many travellers have the misconception that they are more likely to get ill after a flight because they presume the âsame airâ, carrying every passengerâs sniffle, sneeze or cough, is getting recycled and pumped around the aircraft.  In fact, modern jets have very advanced air filtration systems, making transmission via the air you breathe onboard extremely unlikely.  David Nabarro, WHO special envoy for Covid-19, recently said that air travel is ârelatively safeâ when it comes to the spread of coronavirus.  âSo the one good thing about aeroplanes is that the ventilation system includes really powerful filters which means that in our view they are relatively safer,â he told BBC News.  âGiven the excellent ventilation system on modern commercial aircraft and that the main method of transmission [of respiratory infections] is by direct contact and/or airborne droplet, most risk is isolated to those passengers sitting in the same row or that behind or in front of someone sick,â Dr David E Farnie, medical director of Global Response Centre for MedAire Worldwide, told The Independent.  The International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has done extensive research on the topic of air transport and communicable diseases, backs up the assertion that people onboard an aircraft are no more likely to fall ill than anyone in a confined space.  Its fact sheet on Public Health Emergency Preparedness highlights the importance of modern air filters on planes, which âhave a similar performanceâ to those used to keep the air clean in hospital operating rooms and industrial clean rooms.  âHepa (high-efficiency particulate air) filters are effective at capturing greater than 99.9 per cent of the airborne microbes in the filtered air.â  The modern cabin air system delivers around 50 per cent fresh air and 50 per cent filtered, recirculated air.  âAir supply is essentially sterile and particle-free,â says IATA.  In essence, getting on a plane carries a similar risk to entering any confined space with others, such as a train or bus.  What are airlines and airports doing to maximise safety?  IATA has recently published a âroadmap for restarting aviationâ, advising governments on how to reopen the industry.  Rather than focusing on time inside the aircraft, it highlights time spent in the airport, where large numbers of people come into contact with each other.  IATA is calling for passengers to provide health and contact information prior to arrival, check-in remotely and print out boarding cards and luggage tags at home. Other suggestions include introducing temperature testing at entry points, limited access to terminals and the use of automated bag drops at the airport.  Gatwick Airport has put up protective screens at various points including check-in, boarding and at the gates. It has also made mask-wearing mandatory for staff and travellers, installed hand sanitiser stations throughout the airport, changed seating arrangements to ensure social distancing, and introduced tannoy announcements and signs reminding passengers to socially distance and regularly wash their hands.  According to a BBC report, IATA vice-president Nick Careem emphasised the need for âenhanced and frequentâ deep cleaning of the aircraft cabin, adding that the actual flight is relatively low risk and that âphysical distancing on board is not necessaryâ.  Some airlines that have started operated flights again, including easyJet, are requiring passengers to wear a mask once onboard; Ryanair has stipulated that travellers must ask a flight attendant before they can use the toilet to prevent queues from forming.  Most airlines have eliminated or reduced their food and drink offering, plus are demanding contactless payment onboard.  Some airports, such as Pittsburgh in the US, have even deployed ultraviolet cleaning robots to kill microbes in frequently used areas.  While other countries, such as Greece, are doing temperature checks and random swab testing for Covid-19 on all passengers passing through the airport, the UK government has not introduced these measures and insists there is no viable alternative to the blanket two-week quarantine currently imposed on all arrivals from most countries.",https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/coronavirus-plane-flight-stay-safe-ill-seat-covid-face-mask-a9595366.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,6f2be856f0c1fc71bc4664240745ae82eba60d804f45128f40d9b4e45fe4ddae,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

To support us, please consider a contribution.  A European court has sided against a man suspected of murdering Madeleine McCann in his appeal to overturn a separate rape conviction.  It comes after the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) was told by an advisor on Thursday that Germany did not follow the correct procedures when extraditing the suspect, Christian Brueckner, from Italy.  Brueckner was extradited to Germany from Italy in 2018 under an arrest warrant that cited a drugs conviction but was subsequently convicted and sentenced for the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  His lawyer, Friedrich Fulscher, challenged the validity of the arrest warrant as it did not cite the 2005 rape charge. and argued it was a breach of international law to put him on trial for the rape.  A German court subsequently sought guidance from the CJEU, based in Luxembourg. CJEU Advocate General Michal Bobek said in a non-binding opinion that German authorities required consent from Italian authorities for the rape charge so proceedings could be carried out lawfully.  As Italy had agreed the suspect could be tried for rape and extortion in Germany, the CJEU sided against Brueckner. A final decision by CJEU judges will arrive at a later date.  Brueckner, 43, is a suspect in the killing of Madeleine in 2007.  German prosecutor Julia Meter told the PA news agency: âThe advocate general shares our opinion.  âWe are pleased and wait for the decision of the court the next few weeks.â  Brueckner remains in prison in Kiel, north of Germany, where he has already served two-thirds of his sentence for drug trafficking. He had hoped to be released immediately, but will remain in custody until 2027 if his appeal against the rape conviction fails.  German prosecutors Hans Christian Wolters, leading the Madeleine investigation, previously said of Bruecknerâs appeal: âUltimately we cannot influence the decision because it is not related to the McCann investigation.  âThis does not affect our investigation, but of course we would like to know where our suspect is.

Emily Stevenson, a 23-year-old marine biologist, runs a project called Beach Guardian with her father, Rob.  Since launching the initiative in 2017, she and her father have organised more than 200 community litter-picks, with more than 6,000 volunteers taking part to help collect single-use plastic from the ocean.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  In a recent video that Stevenson shared online, she was filmed collecting PPE, including face masks and gloves, from the ocean.  The environmental campaigner also revealed that during a recent one-hour litter pick in Cornwall, she found 171 pieces of PPE.  On a previous occasion when collecting litter on the same route, Stevenson found just six pieces of plastic litter.  âThough this may be a timely issue now, itâs unfortunately not one that is going to go away any time soon either,â she said.  âWeâve already found evidence of PPE actually sinking below the ocean surface. This means that there could be a totally unaccounted for concentration of PPE pollution on the seafloor, which can remain as dormant debris for centuries.â  Stevenson explained that once PPE reaches the seafloor, âit smothers any biological structures such as important Sea Fran beds in the UK, or coral reefs further afieldâ.  âAlso, this debris entails a âplasticisingâ effect when on the seafloor â potentially inhibiting gas exchange between the water column and sediment,â she added.  The marine biologist said that during a recent litter-pick along the Camel Estuary in Cornwall, they discovered a face mask in the water within the first five minutes.  âThis has been the first time I have been legitimately frightened by PPE pollution,â she said.  âPPE is in all of our lives; we use it or see it every day. But it is for this very reason that we can all do something about it.â  According to research cited by Stevenson, if every person in the UK were to wear a single-use face mask every day for a year, this would create an additional 57,000 tonnes of hard-to-recycle plastic and an extra 66,000 tonnes of contaminated PPE waste.  In July, researchers from Royal Holloway, University of London warned that the River Thames had become âseverely pollutedâ with plastic, posing a threat to wildlife and the health of members of the public.  They expressed their concern that the âincreased use of single-use plastic items, and the inappropriate disposal of such items, including masks and gloves, along with plastic-containing cleaning products, during the current Covid-19 pandemic, may well exacerbate this problemâ.  In April, conservationists warned that discarded face masks and gloves worn during the coronavirus pandemic were posing a rising threat to ocean life.

With excellent surfing, outstanding city break destinations and the worldâs favourite custard tarts (pasteis de nata), Portugal has long been a favourite holiday destination for Brits.  But can British holidaymakers even get there? And will we be welcome?  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Hereâs everything you need to know.  Am I allowed to travel to Portugal from the UK?  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) issued a blanket warning against all non-essential international travel in March, but this has now been lifted for more than 80 destinations.  Mainland Portugal didnât make the cut â the warning was only eased for the Azores and Madeira.  The ban doesnât make travel abroad âillegalâ as such â but it does invalidate your travel insurance and means you may find it tricky to get help from the embassy or consulate if things go wrong.  How could I get there?  Flights are still operating between the UK and Portugal.  Tap Air Portugal is operating 14 weekly flights between Heathrow and Lisbon in July.  Ryanair is currently operating one return flight a day between London Stansted and Lisbon â outbound journeys can be pricey, whereas the return leg can be picked up from just Â£14.99.  EasyJetâs started flying to Lisbon from 7 July from London Luton.  Will they let me in when I arrive?  Yes â border restrictions have been lifted on mainland Portugal and its territories of the Azores and Madeira archipelagos (though the latter two have their own rules on testing and quarantine) for certain countries, including the UK.  The countryâs tourist board is doing its utmost to convince tourists itâs safe to return, saying: âThe situation is evolving very positively and the majority of the country will be open with minimum restrictions imposed on the population.â  Will I have to quarantine when I arrive?  In continental Portugal, thereâs no quarantine or self-isolation period required â although there are temperature checks in place at the airport. If yours is 38 degrees or over, or you show signs of being unwell, you will be referred to the health authorities at the airport and may be required to take a Covid-19 test and self-isolate at your accommodation until the test results are known.

On arrival, you will need to either show proof of a negative Covid-19 test, carried out 72 hours before you arrived, or take a test on arrival and await the results at your accommodation. Those staying longer than seven days will have to repeat the test locally, six days after the original test was done.  Those entering Madeira and Porto Santo are asked to upload proof of a negative Covid-19 test carried out 72 hours before departure and to complete a traveller questionnaire 12-48 hours beforehand. If you do not have proof of a Covid-19 test, you will have to take a test at the airport and self-isolate at your accommodation until the results are known (around 12 hours).  Can I travel within Portugal?  Yes, there are no specific restrictions on moving around within Portugal. Public transport remains in operation, but capacity has been reduced to two thirds to enable social distancing, and masks are required at all times. It is currently prohibited for cruise passengers to disembark in Portugal.  Are hotels open?  Campsites and motorhome parks are allowed to reopen to visitors provided capacity and hygiene measures are met, and hotels have been able to open for tourists throughout June.  A âClean and Safeâ stamp created by Turismo de Portugal (the tourist board) certifies which hotels have implemented enhanced hygiene and safety measures.  Airbnb properties are also up and running.  Are restaurants, shops and attractions open?  Since 4 May, bookshops, hairdressers, beauty salons, libraries, sailing clubs and golf courses have been open in Portugal, with social distancing measures in place.  This was followed on 18 May with the reopening of museums and other tourist attractions such as monuments, art galleries, palaces and churches, plus restaurants, bars, cafÃ©s, patisseries, terraces, promenades and shops of up to 400 square metres.  Zoos and aquariums are open, and beaches reopened on 6 June with âsupervisionâ in place and access denied if thereâs a risk of overcrowding.  Cinemas, theatres and concert halls have been permitted to open since 1 June.  The Portuguese tourist board has developed a âClean and Safeâ stamp to identify travel companies and services, such as hotels, tour operators, restaurants and other activity providers, that are complying with certain hygiene and cleaning standards.  What rules are in place?  Throughout Portugal, the use of non-surgical masks is mandatory in enclosed spaces, such as supermarkets, shops, beauty salons, schools, public services, at the airport, in taxis and on public transport, for anyone over the age of 10.  Youâre also required to remain two metres apart from other people when in public, respect the rules on maximum capacity on public transport, in shops and other establishments, and practise good hand hygiene.  Contactless payment is also being encouraged wherever possible.  Drinking alcohol in public places, except for pavement cafÃ©s and restaurants, is banned, and gatherings are limited to 20 people, except for religious ceremonies and family events, such as weddings and christenings.  Rules are stricter in the Greater Lisbon Metropolitan area right now, after a spike in coronavirus cases: private and public gatherings are limited to 10 people; the sale of alcohol at service stations and after 8pm in shops and supermarkets is banned; restaurants must close at 1am with last orders at midnight; and shops and services close at 8pm, with the exception of restaurants, supermarkets, chemists, sports facilities, petrol stations, health and veterinary clinics.  Will I have to quarantine when I come home?  Yes. When you arrive back on UK soil, youâll currently have two weeks of mandatory quarantine to look forward to.  The policy was implemented on 8 June and put in place indefinitely.  The government relaxed the rules from 10 July for certain destinations, and has since added some and removed others.  Countries regarded as âlow-riskâ by the Joint Biosecurity Centre â which was set up to coordinate the governmentâs response to the pandemic â are no longer subject to mandatory quarantine.  Portugal was not included on the initial list of countries exempt from quarantine and, while it was hoped it would be added on the next round of reviews, it missed out once more.",https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/portugal-travel-advice-uk-restrictions-algarve-lisbon-summer-coronavirus-a9575091.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,d1c5eb02e35ecbfcff66a6b6a12d7ec5e448e3a72b07508cd2e3e9d844a3a61d,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

In addition, the Foreign Office says Spain poses âan unacceptably high risk for British travellers,â and now advises against all non-essential travel to the whole country, including the Balearic and Canary Islands.  Travel insurance for British holidaymakers already in Spain will remain in effect; UK travellers in Spain are not being advised to leave.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  But anyone travelling to the mainland against Foreign Office advice will find their policy is invalid.  The sudden moves, in response to several spikes of coronavirus infection in Aragon, Navarra and Catalonia, will affect several hundred thousand British people currently on holiday there.  A further two million people are estimated to be booked to travel from the UK to Spain in the next month alone; it is by far the most popular destination for British holidaymakers.  These are the key questions and answers.  What has changed?  On 8 June the UK government imposed a blanket requirement for all incoming travellers by air, sea and rail to self-isolate for two weeks. This was lifted for dozens of countries, including Spain, on 10 July.  But 16 days after England, Wales and Northern Ireland removed the quarantine requirement from Spain (and just a few days after Scotland did the same), the obligation has been reimposed.  For British holidaymakers currently in Spain, it was shocking news. When they set off, they were not expecting to have to quarantine on their return.  But they are now learning that they must go home from the airport or sea port and stay there for two weeks.  What exactly does quarantine involve?  Arriving travellers are required to go direct to their home or to other suitable accommodation. They may do so by public transport.  The âquarantineeâ must immediately self-isolate for 14 days, timed from the day following their arrival.  A holidaymaker who flew out to Spain for a weekâs holiday on the last no-quarantine day, 25 July, will return on 1 August.  Their self-isolation must begin immediately, but the clock starts ticking only on 2 August â and so the first time they will be able to venture out is immediately after midnight on 16 August.  Meanwhile they can leave home only for medical assistance, to attend court or a funeral â or to go shopping for essentials if there is no one else who can supply provisions.  Leaving home for work, exercise, socialising or walking the dog is not permitted.  But I am a key worker and must return to my job the day after my return. Surely I am exempt?  Almost certainly not. Most of the exemptions are very narrowly defined and cover either transport professionals or key workers travelling from abroad to the UK specifically on government business. Holidays do not count.  What about important family obligations?  You will not be able to leave your house to meet any such commitments during quarantine, unless they involve a court case or, heaven forbid, a funeral,  Can I shorten quarantine by taking a coronavirus test?  No. Unlike some other countries, there is currently no test alternative to UK quarantine â though Heathrow airport and others are pushing for a system involving a sequence of tests that could approximately halve the length of self-isolation.  I have a package holiday booked for August. What are my rights?  Package holidays to Spain will not operate because the Foreign Office regards the area as too dangerous.  Tui cancelled departures on Sunday morning, 26 July, but the aircraft took off anyway to collect passengers from Spain.  Travellers with holidays to mainland Spain up until 17 August have had their trips cancelled, while all packages to the Balearics and Canary Islands are off until 10 August.  âAll customers currently on holiday can continue to enjoy their holiday and will return on their intended flight home,â Tui said.  People whose packages are cancelled will be entitled to a full refund, but can choose an alternative holiday or a voucher for future travel if they prefer.  Under the Package Travel Regulations, people whose trips are cancelled should get their money back within two weeks, but that time limit is unlikely to be met given the extreme stress on the travel industry.  I have booked a âDIYâ trip, with flights, accommodation and car rental all booked separately. Can I get my money back?  It will be difficult. Despite the sudden quarantine decision, there is every chance that your flight will still be operating. After all, there are plenty of people who will be expecting to be flown home from Spain, and so many outbound flights will be running.  If the departure goes ahead as planned, the airline is legally entitled to refuse a refund even though you have compelling reasons not to go â such as work or family commitments.  However, easyJet has said that it will offer options to passengers booked to Spain in the near future, enabling them to switch journeys or take a voucher.  Britainâs biggest budget airline tweeted: âWe are monitoring the situation and continue to provide some flexibility for those who, if they no longer wish to travel, can transfer flights without a change fee or receive a voucher for the value of their booking.  âWe plan to operate our full schedule in the coming days.â  British Airways said: âCustomers who decide they no longer wish to travel are able to claim a voucher for future travel.â  A Ryanair spokesperson told The Independent: âFor non-cancelled flights, standard T&Cs apply.  âPassengers who do not wish to travel on their booked flight can move it to another date, in which case, a flight change fee and the difference in fare may apply.â  While new bookings until September offer no flight-change fee flexibility, for other booking this is Â£35 to Â£95 per flight.  Any accommodation or car-rental flexibility will depend on the deal you agreed with the supplier, and their attitude. They may be prepared to allow you to postpone â but are unlikely to offer you any cash back.  If you have a good insurance policy issued before mid-March, you may be able to claim for unavoidable losses.  Can I dodge quarantine by returning from Spain via France, Gibraltar or another third country?  No. Every traveller to the UK must complete a passenger locator form, in which they are expected to spell out the countries they have visited in the past two weeks.  What if I have another foreign trip due to depart before my 14 days of quarantine are up?  You can go directly from your place of self-isolation to the airport, sea port or international railway station, and leave the country. Indeed, the only way to reduce the length of quarantine is to go abroad again.  The English law is here (Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have near-identical Statutory Instruments.) It says you must self-isolate until whichever is the earlier of (a) the end of the 14th day after the day of arrival or (b) departure from England.  It adds: âDuring the period of their self-isolation [a person] may not leave, or be outside of, the place where [they are] self-isolating except to travel in order to leave England, provided that they do so directly.â  Regrettably, the government online guidance is misleading. It says: âWhen you arrive in the UK, you will not be allowed to leave the place where youâre staying for the first 14 days youâre in the UK (known as âself-isolatingâ) unless youâre arriving from an exempt country.â  The Independent has asked the government to correct its online advice and align it with the law.  Note that if you return from the second trip less than 14 days after you originally arrived back from Spain, you must complete the original quarantine. Going abroad again does not absolve the quarantine.  What happens if I break quarantine?  The penalty for failing to comply is Â£1,000 (reduced to Â£480 in Scotland).  Who is checking up?  The public health authorities have been making some tracking calls, though the majority of holidaymakers arriving recently from quarantine-obligatory countries appear not to have been contacted.  The resources that will now be required to quarantine will make it challenging for officials to keep tabs on travellers.  The Independent is aware of only one fine being issued for a breach of quarantine, in Lincolnshire  Why has the whole of Spain been included?  Presumably to keep the message simple. The authorities in the four UK nations could have applied the rule for the specific regions of Spain, notably Catalonia and Aragon, where the most significant spikes have occurred.  Instead, they have chosen to enforce the policy for the whole country â including the Balearics and Canary Islands.  This has the possibly unintended consequence of persuading British travellers, who would be at low risk of contracting coronavirus in the Spanish islands, to stay in the UK â increasing the danger to them.  The reason may simply be as banal as the Passenger Locator Form for arriving passengers being designed to deal with whole countries, not parts of them.  What effect will this decision have on the travel industry?  Utter devastation. Just as the travel industry thought 2020 could get no worst, it has. Airlines and holiday companies are already on their knees after the worst four months in their history.  The immediate damage in terms of refunds for cancelled package holidays will run into many tens of millions of pounds.  Airlines that had been hoping to exploit an apparent appetite for Spanish holidays to help fill flights in late July and August now face the prospect of no fresh bookings. They may also have to cancel planned departures because it could be less financially ruinous to pay out refunds than to operate half-empty planes.  The longer-term effects could be even worse.  The weekend when the government chose to make the decision was the busiest so far this summer. Many holidaymakers were setting off on long-planned trips that would provide a welcome escape after months of lockdown.  Instead, many find themselves confused and anxious.  Travel, previously the industry of human happiness, depends on confidence. Now that many dream trips have turned into nightmares, bookings for September and October are now likely to dry up â not just for Spain, but for every other country.  Quarantine is now regarded as the âMartini menaceâ because the obligation for travellers to self-isolate can evidently be brought in anytime, any place, anywhere.",https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/spain-holidays-coronavirus-quarantine-latest-what-mean-guide-a9638176.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,610605a05b239f580a851dab6e3b7e65ff866aef255cd337b5b2a43ac9c10e81,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

To support us, please consider a contribution.  On 2 June, Justin LaFrancois attended a protest against police violence and racism in downtown Charlotte, North Carolina, where he planned to livestream the event for his alternative newspaper's website.  Shortly into the march, police, who reported that water bottles and rocks were being thrown at them, unleashed a volley of tear gas on the entire crowd, including those who were marching peacefully. The protesters tried to run. But hemmed in by tall buildings and desperate for an escape route, they tugged at the closed gate of a parking garage, pulling it up just high enough so they could slip inside to escape the pepper balls and exploding flash grenades.  âOh, my God,â Mr LaFrancois said in a video that captured him wheezing hard and coughing from exposure to the gas. âMy face is on fire. My eyes are on fire.â  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  The Charlotte protest was one of the dozens around the country during the past few months where police unleashed tear gas on peaceful protesters. Tear gas has commonly been used as a defensive tool by law enforcement to make rioters disperse.  But during the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies have sometimes been using it offensively, including against peaceful protesters, children, and pregnant women, without providing an escape route or piling on excessive amounts of gas, witnesses and human rights advocates say.  Law enforcement officials say tear gas, if used properly, is an effective tool for crowd control.  Without it, âthe only thing left to do is physical force â shields and batons,â said Deputy Police Chief Jeff Estes of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. Mr Estes said he's been exposed to tear gas and pepper spray many times.  âSo, I know the effects. I would rather have that than see what we've seen in other places where people who are violently assaulting other people have to get hit with sticks and shields,â Mr Estes said.  But interviews by the Associated Press with medical researchers, federal regulatory agencies, and a review of US government-funded scientific studies raise questions about the safety of the gas, especially its use on individuals in confined spaces, in excessive quantities, and when it's fired directly at protesters. Medical professionals interviewed by the AP said the use of tear gas is particularly concerning during the Covid-19 epidemic. The AP also found that there is no government oversight of the manufacture and use of tear gas. Instead, the industry is left to regulate itself.  âI think this is deeply problematic because there's no transparency around the manufacture or the sale of these weapons,â said Rohini Haar, an emergency room physician and researcher at the University of California School of Public Health in Berkeley who has published studies on tear gas. âThe US has an obligation to protect its citizens. We regulate so many other things. This is an actual chemical weapon.â  Ms Haar said her research shows that tear gas has also been getting stronger over the years. She said she is particularly concerned about the unknown health effects of silicon that is sometimes added to tear gas to make it last longer in the air and on surfaces.

Four never responded to repeated requests for comment. A fifth, the Safariland Group, declined an interview request through a public relations firm but noted that the company was divesting Defence Technology, its tear gas maker, to its current managers in the third quarter of this year.  Tear gas was developed around the First World War and is banned in warfare by the Chemical Weapons Convention, ratified by almost every country in the world including the United States. But it allows chemicals classified as riot control agents, including tear gas, to be used for law enforcement.  However the provisions of the agreement don't regulate what counts as a riot-control agent, said Anna Feigenbaum, author of the book âTear Gas: From the Battlefields of World War I to the Streets of Todayâ.  âAnd they ignore or fail to address offensive use of such agents by law enforcement,â Ms Feigenbaum told AP.  Tear gas works by using a host of chemicals that render individuals unable to function by causing irritation to the eyes, mouth, throat, lungs, and skin.  But despite its widespread use, medical experts say there are few studies on the health effects of tear gas, and many focus on the impact of crowd control irritants on military personnel, a population that tends to be healthier and in better physical condition than the general public. The US Army even moved to protect its own troops after a study published in 2014 showed that recruits exposed to tear gas in basic training had a nearly 2.5-times greater risk of being diagnosed with acute respiratory illness. The Army reacted by lowering concentrations of tear gas and shortening exposure times for the training.  A 2014 study funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Defence, and the National Academy of Sciences did try to specify levels of tear gas concentrations that can cause irreversible damage or death.  But Sven Eric Jordt, an associate professor and researcher at Duke University's School of Medicine, who has long studied tear gas, is critical of the study, saying it merely recommended levels that should not be exceeded and relied heavily on research that's a half-century or more years old.  Thor Eells, executive director of the non-profit National Tactical Officers Association, said in a telephone interview the substances are so safe that even if a police department used its entire inventory at one time, no one would be killed or sustain serious injury. Mr Eells has taught tear gas use with a Colorado police department and with Defence Technology.  âAn agency will not have enough of the chemical munitions in their current inventory to come even close to being dangerous,â he said.  The American Thoracic Society is calling for a moratorium on tear gas, citing the âthe lack of crucial research, the escalation of tear gas use by law enforcement, and the likelihood of compromising lung health and promoting the spread of Covid-19â.

To support us, please consider a contribution.  The full Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) judgement on Manchester Cityâs successful appeal against their two-year ban from the Champions League throws up a number of issues. Uefa could hardly have made a worse mess of the case. City were obstructive to the point where the panel fined them Â£9m. That is small change at the Etihad compared to the price they could have paid if found guilty.  European footballâs ruling body have been undermined seriously by this showdown with City but the Nyon-based organisation only has itself to blame. Uefaâs almost flippant attitude leaps out of the pages of the report. Each party is allowed to select a member of the three-man panel but City also suggested the chairman as well as their nominee. Uefa waved through this idea in the interests of speedy procedure.  Cas notes that the Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules can only operate with the cooperation of clubs. City withheld witnesses and information from Uefaâs Investigatory and Adjudicatory Chambers. On the basis of the evidence, the governing body believed it would prevail in the appeal in Lausanne. However, Uefa allowed City to introduce new witnesses at Cas, undoing the Adjudicatory Chamber's work. This was strictly against Uefaâs own rules. Allowing this backfired badly.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  It meant that to rule against City the panel would have to reject âthe evidence of several high-ranking officials of large international commercial enterprisesâ, at least two of whom would face potential criminal sanctions if the decision went against them. City smothered the opposition with hitherto hidden witnesses and evidence.  The nub of the case is whether Cityâs state-owned sponsors inflated their payments to the club with direct payments from Abu Dhabiâs ruling family. Two years ago the Football Leaks website released a cache of illegally-obtained emails that were published by Der Spiegel, the German magazine. These internal City communications appeared to show the club had flouted FFP rules. Uefa initially asked for the chain of emails linked with the alleged breaches but did not follow up with more requests when the communications were not delivered by the club. This resulted in the panel declaring, âAs a consequence, since Uefa did not pursue its request to be provided with the runs of emails of which the Leaked Emails formed part, the majority of the Panel finds that no adverse inferences can be drawn from the fact that MCFC did not provide such information.â  Uefaâs processes and tactics backfired badly. Nyon made it easy for City to shoot down the allegations at Cas. The case could not have been handled more badly had they tried.  The victory for City is almost complete but the Cas document is hardly a ringing endorsement of the clubâs innocence. The Etihadâs approach to the dispute was to stonewall, avoid cooperation where possible and challenge Uefaâs procedural issues. The two parties had clashed over FFP before and negotiated a settlement six years ago. Uefa has been convinced that this 2014 agreement was based on false premises. Cas said this was immaterial as events before this were time-barred by Uefaâs rules, although the panel noted that information provided by City last year âwould have provided a more complete and accurate picture of two payments to MCFC in 2012 and 2013 that were before the CFCB (Club Financial Control Body) when the Settlement Agreement was entered into.â  Whether City like it or not, the stench of Football Leaks remains hanging around the Etihad. The 93 pages of the report spell out a botched prosecution by an organisation that is not fit for purpose and an appellant whose opaqueness leaves their behaviour open to question.  The panelâs point that FFP relies on the cooperation of the clubs is correct. Without willing participation, the attempt to regulate financial excess is left in ruins. Casâs judgement is an obituary for FFP.  Some may say that this is a good thing. City, after all, only spent money they could afford and the club has not been threatened with debt and instability. What is put in jeopardy by the ability to spend huge sums of cash is the notion of competition. If Uefa â and football â wants to keep the idea of competitiveness alive it will have to find another formula and maintain a more rigorous approach to policing the big clubs.  Casâs verdict does not vindicate City but it damns Uefa. It is sobering reading for anyone in the game.",https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/man-city-uefa-ban-appeal-cas-verdict-reasons-a9643511.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,c12959ff23f4d560d48ced98d300315cd59f9e40aaed4276987e00fb8b281daf,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

To support us, please consider a contribution.  Donald Trump was âstating a factâ when he said that children are less susceptible to Covid-19, a White House official has said after Facebook removed a post in which the president made false claims about the virus.  Courtney Parella, deputy national press secretary, accused Facebook and Twitter of âflagrant biasâ after the tech giants penalised Trump and his campaign team for promoting a video in which the president claimed children are âalmost immuneâ from the disease.  âThe president was stating a fact that children are less susceptible to the coronavirus,â Ms Parella said in a statement. âAnother day, another display of Silicon Valleyâs flagrant bias against this president, where the rules are only enforced in one direction.

But officials at the firm later removed the post, saying it had violated the social media platformâs âpolicies around harmful COVID misinformationâ. It is the first time Facebook has made such a move.  The @TeamTrump Twitter page also posted a clip from the interview, which was later retweeted by the presidentâs offical account. Twitter subsequently banned @TeamTrump from tweeting until the post had been removed.  A spokesperson for Twitter said the post violated its rules on coronavirus misinformation. @TeamTrump later removed the tweet and was posting again on Wednesday evening â the post also disappered from the presidentâs official account.  YouTube also said it had pulled down a video containing the presidents false claims.  In his interview with Fox News, Trump had been discussing the reopening of schools in America, a topic that is being fiercely debated.

The FCO keeps individual country pages on its website regularly updated, with all the latest information and warnings about potential risks, such as political unrest, natural disasters and terror attacks.  If the FCO advises against âall but essential travelâ to a country, it invalidates travellersâ insurance, and visiting there is at your own risk.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Hereâs everything you need to know about the current advice.  What is the latest Foreign Office advice?  The FCO has been advising British nationals against all but essential international travel since 23 March. However, this advice was lifted for 67 destinations as of 4 July.  This list was updated later in July to include a further 19 destinations, but two were removed after further spikes in coronavirus cases: Spain and Serbia. There was much confusion for holidaymakers after the FCO initially left Spainâs Balearic and Canary Islands on its exempt list, before changing its advice again less than 48 hours later.  Luxembourg was also given the boot after a spike in coronavirus cases.  The FCO list is separate from the one issued by the Department for Transport (DfT), which details âtravel corridorâ destinations from where travellers can now enter England, Wales and Northern Ireland without having to quarantine for two weeks. Scotland published its own list, which is currently identical to that of the DfT.  Why can I book a flight to a country if the FCO warns against travelling there?  Many airlines have been restarting operations â for example, easyJet had its first flight post-lockdown, a hop from London to Glasgow, on 15 June after 11 weeks of being grounded.  Others continued to operate flights throughout April and May, much to the confusion of consumers, considering most countriesâ borders were closed at that point and the FCO advised against all international travel.  Wizz Air, for example, restarted flights from Luton to 15 destinations in May, including Budapest, Belgrade and Tenerife. Ryanair started selling seats to numerous European destinations, including Barcelona, Athens, Bologna and Nimes, from mid-May.  Wizz said the flights were âto provide an essential service to those who need to travelâ, reported Forbes â presumably referring to returning citizens and permanent residents or medical staff, the only people who would be exempt from the rules.  Which? claimed at the time that it looked like airlines were cynically still running flights so that those who had already purchased tickets but were unable to fly because of FCO advice would be unable to claim a refund.  Ryanair, for example, is continuing to run scheduled flights to Cyprus throughout July and denying passengers a refund, despite the fact the countryâs borders are currently closed to those travelling from the UK.  As countries in Europe start to open their borders again, and the UK announces the relaxation of both the FCO blanket travel warning and the mandatory two-week quarantine for inbound travellers from certain countries, catching a flight abroad purely for leisure purposes finally seems feasible. But Britons should be aware that travel advice can change at the last-minute â as was the case with Spain being removed from both the DfT and FCO âsafeâ lists â and that when this happens, airlines are not legally obliged to refund flight-only passengers. However, those whoâve booked a package holiday will be protected from some changes; if the FCO suddenly says it advises against travelling to a destination, tour operators will generally cancel holidays there and are required by law to refund customers in full.  Can I travel within the UK?  From 4 July, up to two households have been allowed to stay overnight in âself-contained accommodationâ together â including hotels, bed and breakfasts and campsites â as long as social distancing guidelines are followed.  Many English hotels reopened on 4 July, complete with stringent new cleaning measures.  Shape Created with Sketch.

Northern Ireland was a day ahead, with hotels, pubs, restaurants and tourist attractions all able to open with suitable social-distancing measures from 3 July, while Scotland reopened many tourist facilities on 15 July. Aberdeen is currently experiencing a local lockdown, with people told not to travel there and residents banned from travelling more than five miles from home for leisure purposes.  Travel restrictions in Wales were lifted on 6 July and self-contained accommodation has been able to re-open as of 13 July.  Up until 17 July, anyone without a car was pretty stuck when it came to domestic travel, as the government advised against all ânon-essentialâ public transport journeys. But Boris Johnson has now said travelling by public transport is permitted throughout England, whatever the reason for your journey.  When is the advice against international travel likely to end?  The FCO travel warning has been lifted for 67 destinations as of 4 July. More destinations have since been added, while others have been removed â click here for the latest list.  The need to quarantine has also been removed for travellers entering the UK from countries and territories regarded as âlow-riskâ by the Joint Biosecurity Centre, as well as 14 British Overseas Territories and the Common Travel Area (Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man).  Popular holiday destinations that are exempt from both restrictions include France, Italy, Greece and Turkey.

My kids watch Anna and Kristoff make out in Frozen,"The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a contribution.  When two teenage girls kiss in an episode of CBBCâs teen drama series The Next Step, it's uplifting: they look so happy. It reminds me of the wonder and excitement of my first kiss when I was a teenager, even though mine was with a boy.  Yet some BBC viewers are outraged that a same-sex kiss was aired on the childrenâs network, claiming that itâs not appropriate for a young audience. Since the scene aired two weeks ago in the episode âRoom Serviceâ, the BBC has been flooded with complaints.  The popular Canadian mockumentary drama series â now in its seventh series â is about a dance troupe whose members train and compete in championships. But as I watched Molly Saundersâs Jude pulling Danielle Verayoâs Cleo closer during a flirtatious dance routine, and then kiss her passionately, I couldnât see what all the fuss was about.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  âIâm so lucky to have Cleo in my life,â says Jude in a voiceover just before they embrace. Afterwards, her face lights up; sheâs clearly over the moon that her feelings are reciprocated. As they walk off the set hand-in-hand to twinkly music, Cleo says: âJude is so full of love. I canât imagine being with anyone else.â  The scene has been praised by fans of the show, who say itâs a huge leap forward for representation of LGBT+ and the normalising of gay relationships. The LGBT+ charity Stonewall said it was âan exciting moment for LGBT representationâ and commended the series for improving âunderstanding of what it means to be lesbianâ for young viewers of the show.  So what exactly is the problem?  It's been 26 years since the first female same-sex kiss â between Beth Jordache (Anna Friel) and Margaret Clemence (Nicola Stephenson) â was broadcast before the 9pm watershed on the Channel 4 soap opera, Brookside, in 1994.  As a result, it became more acceptable for women to explore their sexuality. But in 2020, is it really possible that same-sex kisses can cause such hysteria? Sadly, the answer is yes.  In response to more than 100 complaints, the BBC has had to stand by its decision to show the scene to young viewers. In a statement on the BBC website, the broadcaster said it believed the storyline was âhandled with sensitivityâ and âwithout sensationalismâ. The decision to include it âwas taken very carefullyâ. Along with the production company Boatrocker who make the show, the BBC âacknowledgedâ that the series âcould and should do more to reflect the lives of LGBTQ+ young peopleâ.  It added: âThis is an important part of our mission to make sure that every child feels like they belong, that they are safe, and that they can be who they want to be.â  Itâs not the first time same-sex relationships have featured in CBBC shows â as the BBC pointed out. The CBBC football drama Jamie Johnson introduced a gay storyline earlier this year, in which teenager Dillon comes out as gay to Elliott.  Other shows on the childrenâs network such as 4 OâClock Club, Dixie, and Marrying Mum and Dad have also tackled same-sex relationships. The Next Step is not the first same-sex kiss on CBBC either. It happened in 1994âs Byker Grove in a scene in which Noddy Fishwick kisses his friend Gary Hendrix.  So why the big deal now?  My daughters didnât bat an eyelid when I showed them the clip of Jude and Cleo kissing. Of course, at two and four years old, they arenât exactly the target audience for the show â but CBBC aired it at 5pm. What if The Next Step had come on TV when Iâd stepped out of the room?  They found it exciting, saying: âMummy will they end up living in a castle together happily ever after?â  Is it horrifying that I showed it to them? Of course it isnât. What is the fear? That they will stray from the conventional and end up loving women, not men? Is that so bad? If they can watch Anna and Kristoff kiss in Frozen â why the hell canât they watch Jude and Cleo do the same?  I also emailed the clip to my friendâs children, two girls aged nine, since itâs aimed at pre-teens and young teens. They were totally accepting of it â although one of them said, âItâs cool but a bit strange.â Isnât this exactly why itâs so important that representation is inclusive from an early age â to normalise it?  Same-sex kissing has been popping up on British TV since 1974 when Alison Steadman and Myra Frances played two female army officers in the BBC drama Girl â but unlike Brookside, it was aired post-watershed after 9pm.  The scene was considered so shocking that the 35-minute programme came with a warning. Five years later, the first screen kiss between two men appeared on BBC Oneâs drama Coming Out in 1979, as part of their acclaimed Play for Today series.  When EastEnders aired the first homosexual kiss on the lips on a British soap opera in 1989, between Michael Cashmanâs Colin Russell and his partner Guido Smith (Nicholas Donovan), The Sun newspaper called it a âlove scene between yuppie poofsâ.  Fast forward 25 years and complaints were still coming in to the writers of EastEnders when in 2014, Sam Strikeâs Johnny Carter and Danny Pennant (Gary Lucy) kissed.  While shows with myriad queer characters, such as The L Word, Queer as Folk, Will & Grace, Orange is the New Black, and Glee, have been ground-breaking in changing attitudes and being more inclusive, there is still a long way to go. The fact there is still stigma over same-sex love, as seen in this storm over a kiss on CBBC, is disheartening. How can we normalise gay relationships for our children if they canât see realistic depictions of them?  One of TVâs first lesbian relationships was Willow (Alyson Hannigan) and Tara (Amber Benson) in Buffy the Vampire Slayer â and their first on-screen kiss in 2001âs fifth season was not only emotionally charged but a milestone for LGBT+ representation. But the fact that the BBC now has to defend a beautiful moment on The Next Step, shows that unfortunately, there are still big strides to be made.

To support us, please consider a contribution.  Could James Murdoch help save the world from climate catastrophe? One of the most important documentaries ever about the climate emergency has just been screened by the BBC. But it was not another exposÃ© of the damage done to humanity and nature by carbon emissions. It was instead about the Murdoch media dynasty.  The series surgically exposed the enormous political power wielded by the Rupert Murdoch empire in the UK, US and Australia. It focused on three aspects of how the Murdochsâ used that power.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Firstly, as king-makers helping right-wing politicians win presidencies and prime minister-ships. Trump, Johnson, Blair, Cameron, Morrison and Abbott all courted the Murdochs and received their blessing and with it the full-throated backing of their media empire.  Secondly, it showed how the Murdochs used their UK media dominance to endlessly propagandise for Brexit for over 30 years and how they and the far-right politician Nigel Farage forged a partnership that helped ensure Brexit succeeded. This was done with a devastating multimillion pound flood of xenophobia and misinformation about the EUâs democratic processes.  But it was the revelation that the most powerful media baron in the world opposes climate action that makes the series so important. It featured an interview with Rupert Murdoch where he said: âWe should approach climate change with great scepticism. Climate change has been going on as long as the planet has been here. There will always be a little bit of it.â  Murdoch wrongly stated that if at the worst we have a 3C rise in temperature over the coming century, then at most only 1C will have been caused by human activities. Then in true Trumpian style, he goes on to say, âIf there is a six-inch rise in sea-levels, we cannot stop it. We just have to stop building vast houses on seashores.â  The Murdoch empire has never backed a political leader in any countries that supported urgent climate and ecological action. Their Fox News, Wall Street Journal and US tabloids led the charge opposing action, which led to the Republican Party switching from supporting market-based mechanisms for climate action under John McCain, to vociferously opposing climate science under Trump. This led the US to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement and thereby undermining the global momentum behind it.  In Australia, the Murdochâs 70 per cent stranglehold on its newspaper industry meant climate scepticism was pumped out for decades, despite Australia being one of the most vulnerable countries to the initial climate shock-waves.  This has been demonstrated by the recent devastating droughts, heat waves and rainforest fires. A recent report outlined how over 3 billion animals were burnt or harmed in this winterâs Australian bush fires. This has pushed many of the countryâs unique and rich diversity of animal species to the edge of extinction.  The Murdoch papers have played a key role in the toppling of three Australian prime ministers â Kevin Rudd (twice!), Julia Gillard and Malcolm Turnbull â who dared to take action on the crises, whether from the centre-right or centre-left parties. In the UK, the Murdoch-backed Johnson-led Tories had by far the weakest general election manifesto provisions on climate of all the major parties.  The Murdochsâ Sun newspaper led the campaign to try to force fracking through against widespread local opposition. While the Murdoch-owned Times newspaper was attacked by a group of leading UK scientists decrying its distorted and poor quality climate coverage. Murdochâs climate scepticism is also echoed in the UKâs other off-shore media billionaire owned papers The Mail and Telegraph.  The final programme in the BBC Murdoch series coincided with a major split in the Murdoch dynasty. James Murdoch, under whose leadership Sky News had a positive line on climate action, announced he was quitting the News Corp board, citing editorial differences.  This followed the unprecedented public condemnation by him and his wife Kathryn of the climate scepticism being promoted by the familyâs Fox News, Wall Street Journal and their vast media empire in Australia.  These outlets are under the management of his brother Lachlan, who has been described by one former News Corp executive as being to the right of any politician in Australia. Jamesâs resignation means that Lachlan, the eldest son, is now the only remaining sibling at a senior level in the corporation.  But Murdochâs News Corp is not alone in refusing to support urgent action on the climate and ecological emergencies among the worldâs newspaper, advertising and broadcasting empires. Indeed, nearly all of them promote high-carbon lifestyles as the desirable social norm, whether large cars or foreign holidays.  With the UN warning that humanity faces an existential crisis unless it starts cutting emissions radically by the end of 2020, what can be done if we need the global media barons on board to ensure public support for the necessary political actions?  Maybe the departure of James Murdoch, having failed to persuade the family firm to drop its genocidal climate scepticism, might be a blessing for the movement? He has the global profile to take a lead, with other climate action supporting media billionaires like Bloomberg and Jeff Bezos, to launch a global media summit on the climate emergency at next yearâs COP26 summit in Glasgow.  It is time for the worldâs most powerful media owners and editors to assemble and agree a global media climate and ecological emergency media charter. This would outline how they can step up to the most important task ever entrusted to them â the protection of humanity and what is left of nature from possible extinction. Such a meeting could be held under the auspices of the UN High Level Climate Action Champions, the UKâs Nigel Topping and Chileâs Gonzalo MuÅoz.  It should be a top priority for the global climate movement to pressure the worldâs media leaders to attend such an event and to sign up their corporations to its proposed charter.  The BBC Murdoch documentary showed how such a meeting would have more power to save the world than all the previous 25 COP conferences put together.

Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Mr Kettaneh told LBCI TV on Wednesday that the Red Cross was working with the countryâs health ministry for morgues to receive victims, as hospitals are struggling to cope.  ""What we are witnessing is a huge catastrophe. There are victims and casualties everywhere,â he told broadcaster Mayadeen.  The cause of the explosion  It is thought that the explosion was caused by a fire which detonated 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored at the port for six years.  However, officials have yet to say what sparked the initial blaze.  In a post on Twitter, Lebanonâs president Michael Aoun said it was âunacceptableâ that tonnes of ammonium nitrate, a substance used in bombs and fertilisers, had been kept without safety measures in place.  He vowed that those responsible would face the âharshest punishmentsâ.  Statements given by Lebanese officials contradict President Donald Trumpâs comments that the explosion âlooks like a terrible attackâ, which were labelled ""wildly irresponsible"" by Brett McGurk, former national security official in his own administration.  The damage  Footage posted by residents on social media showed smoke initially rising from the port, before a large explosion went off.  The detonation was so powerful that people a mile from the port were thrown backwards by its force.

Videos show that many buildings have been badly damaged by the blast, with debris and ruined cars lining the streets.  Importance of port  Lebanon's port is vitally important to the country, which relies on it as an entry-point for much of its imports.  The blasts damaged the port's major grain silo, which is operated by the Lebanese Ministry of Economy and Trade, and destroyed the wheat stored there.  Raoul Nehme, the minister of economy and trade, said the wheat was now ""contaminated"" and was unusable, according to Lebanon's state-run National News Agency.  However, he added that the country has enough wheat for the time being.  Food security is an issue in Lebanon, which has seen the price of essential items soar in recent months due to its economic difficulties.  Emergency response  Lebanonâs Supreme Defence Council has advised declaring a two-week state of emergency for Beirut, with military authorities taking charge of security issues.  The president has allocated 100bn Lebanese pounds (Â£50,717,000) from this yearâs budget to the emergency response efforts.  The disaster comes as Lebanon continues to struggle with an economic crisis and an increase in the number of coronavirus infections.  Worldwide support  Countries including the UK, Australia and France have offered assistance to Lebanon.  British prime minister Boris Johnson said the UK was ready to support Lebanon, adding that some British nationals may have been affected by the incident.  âThe pictures and videos from Beirut tonight are shocking. All of my thoughts and prayers are with those caught up in this terrible incident,â he said in a statement on Twitter on Tuesday.  Junior education minister Nick Gibb told the BBC on Wednesday: ""The government is working urgently this morning on what we can do to help the Lebanese government with technical support and of course working with our allies to provide financial assistance.""  Meanwhile, France is sending dozens of emergency workers and 15 tons of aid, and hopes to treat 500 victims.

However, experts have said such a move may in fact be illegal.  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had already targeted messaging platform WeChat for its perceived relationship to the Chinese government and gave details about what the Trump government is now calling the âClean Networkâ program.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  âWith parent companies based in China, apps like TikTok, WeChat and others are significant threats to personal data of American citizens, not to mention tools for CCP (Chinese Communist Party) content censorship,â Pompeo said.  Companies that will be affected by the policy include Alibaba, Baidu, China Mobile, China Telecom, and Tencent â some of Chinaâs largest technology companies â as well as Huawei, which recently became the worldâs biggest smartphone manufacturer.  Pompeo said the United States was working to prevent Huawei pre-installing or making available for download the most popular US apps on its phones.  In 2019, the US government forbid Google from providing its commercial services â including Maps, YouTube, and the Play Store for Huawei phones.  Sources have said that other companies, including Facebook, have restricted their services on Huaweiâs platforms for similar reasons regarding the US governmentâs approach to China.  âWe don't want companies to be complicit in Huawei's human rights abuses, or the CCP's surveillance apparatus,â Pompeo said, without mentioning any specific American companies.  He said the State Department was also working to ensure China could not compromise information carried by undersea cables that connect the United States to the global internet.  Outside experts called Pompeo's proposal vague and possibly illegal.  âIt's a PR stunt. No specifics. It's an objective,â George Washington University professor Susan Ariel Aaronson said by email.  Eurasia Group analyst Paul Triolo said the government is trying to push its allies and companies to stop using Chinese gear and software âat all levels of their communications networks, from the internet backbone to app stores.â  That includes calling for companies to yank their apps from Huawei's app store, which advertises that it contains apps from European and U.S. companies like travel service Booking and Amazon.  The legal authority for the administration to act against apps and app stores is unclear, Triolo write in a research note.  The State Department did not immediately a question seeking information about the legal authority the administration could use to justify such measures.  The initiative is meant to force countries and companies to choose sides between the U.S. and China, Triolo said. He expects many companies and governments to resist.  In an interview with state news agency Xinhua on Wednesday, Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said the United States âhas no rightâ to set up the âClean Networkâ and calls the actions by Washington as âa textbook case of bullyingâ.  âAnyone can see through clearly that the intention of the U.S. is to protect its monopoly position in technology and to rob other countries of their proper right to development,â said Wang.  President Trump has said that TikTok must be sold to a US company â most likely Microsoft â in order to separate it from its Chinese parent company Bytedance. Mr Trump also said that the US Treasury would take a cut of the deal, comparing the relationship to that between a landlord and a tenant.  TikTokâs founder has said that the Trump administrationâs real aim is not one based on of national security, but rather than it wants a âban or even moreâ on Chinese services due to negative US-China relations.

United are expected to save within the region of Â£40m after allowing the Chilean to make his season-long loan spell at the Giuseppe Meazza permanent.  The Old Trafford club have made a âsmallâ pay-off to cover some of Sanchezâs basic salary, which stood in the region of Â£350,000-a-week before significant bonuses and image rights payments.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  The Chile international's contract still had two years left to run, having joined from Arsenal in January 2018 in a swap deal which saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan move in the opposite direction.  Despite arriving as one of the Premier Leagueâs most prolific attacking players, Sanchez scored just five goals in 45 appearances and struggled to establish himself under both Jose Mourinho and his successor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.  Sanchez was allowed to spend the 2019-20 season on loan at Inter, where a run of three goals and seven assists post-lockdown has helped to convince the Serie A club to negotiate a permanent deal.  The 31-year-old has unsurprisingly taken a significant pay cut - believed to be approximately Â£120,000-a-week - to join up with Antonio Conte's side on a three-year contract.  Sanchez could now face his former employers in the Europa League final on 21 August, should both United and Inter progress through next week's eight-team mini-tournament in Cologne.

2020-08-06 13:20:10.600705,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 09:12:00 GMT",Will I have to quarantine if I go on holiday this summer?,"While the travel industry is doing its level best to restart in earnest, there are still several big hurdles that could put the kibosh on your summer holiday plans for 2020.  One is the Foreign Office travel advice, and the other is the dreaded Q-word: quarantine.  Hereâs everything you need to know about the latter.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Will I have to quarantine when I go on holiday?  This is largely dependent on the country in question. Some places are still all but closed to foreign visitors â for example, New Zealand â while others are tentatively reopening their borders.  In Europe, countries permitting entry to British visitors without any quarantine period or need to produce a health certificate include Spain, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Germany, Croatia, Belgium, Sweden and Switzerland.  France previously required Brits to undergo a two-week quarantine (though it was somewhat voluntary in nature), but has lifted this measure since the UK did likewise for travellers entering the country from France.  Click here for The Independentâs list of countries where you wonât have to quarantine when you get there or get back, and where the FCO warning against non-essential travel has been lifted.  Will I have to quarantine when I get back to the UK?  If you do manage to slip away to foreign climes, when you touch down back on UK soil you might have two weeks of mandatory quarantine to look forward to.  The policy was implemented on 8 June and put in place indefinitely, subject to regular review.  The Department for Transport (DfT) announced the relaxation of self-isolation measures from 10 July for those entering England, Wales and Northern Ireland from certain countries.  Inbound travellers from a range of places regarded as âlow-riskâ by the Joint Biosecurity Centre â which was set up to coordinate the governmentâs response to the pandemic â are exempt from quarantine.  There are currently more than 60 countries and territories on the exempt list, including popular holiday destinations such as France, Italy, Greece and Turkey. But the list is subject to last-minute changes and updates: as of 28 July, Slovenia, Slovakia, Latvia, Estonia and St Vincent and the Grenadines have been added, while Serbia and â controversially â Spain have been removed. Luxembourg also got the boot after a surge in cases.  Scotland released its own list of exempt countries, which currently matches the DfTâs list now Spain and Serbia have been removed.  Just because a country is on this list, it doesnât mean there is a reciprocal agreement in place â you may still have to self-isolate when you arrive there, just not when you get back to the UK.  There is also a separate list of places where the Foreign Office has lifted its blanket advice against all non-essential travel.  What are the current rules on quarantining in the UK?  The presumption will be that you are carrying Covid-19. You should ideally occupy a room separate from any other members of the household where youâre staying.  âAvoid contact with the people youâre staying with and minimise the time you spend in shared areas,â says the Home Office.  You must not go to work, school or to any public areas, or use public transport or taxis (although it is permissible to use the latter when travelling from the airport).  You should not have visitors, including friends and family, unless they are providing essential support.  Do not go out to buy food or other essentials âwhere you can rely on others,â officials say.  Will the quarantine be enforced?  Public Health England have set up an assurance service to contact people at random to ensure they understand the requirements and are self-isolating.  Officials can telephone or call at the nominated address at any time during the 14 days. If the traveller is not at home or out with a valid excuse, a Â£1,000 fixed penalty notice will be issued in England and Wales (Â£480 in Scotland).  However, so far only one person has been fined for breaching quarantine.  Will the quarantine be effective?  The home secretary Priti Patel said: âThese measures are informed by science, backed by the public and will keep us all safe.â  However, senior public health experts, MPs and travel industry representatives have all questioned the efficacy of the policy, which was devised by Dominic Cummings.  The governmentâs chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said: âMeasures like this are most effective when the number of cases is very low, and theyâre most effective when theyâre applied to countries from higher rates.â  Speaking to MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee about the quarantine, Sir David Skegg, a New Zealand professor of preventive and social medicine, said: âItâs not clear to me what the UK strategy is for dealing with this diseaseâ¦ From the UKâs point of view, it doesnât look very logical to me to have 14 days quarantine for people coming from countries with a much lower incidence and prevalence of Covid-19.  âThese border measures would be most effective if they were conducted very early.â  When will the quarantine be lifted?  The policy was eased on 10 July. Although the quarantine will stay in place for everywhere else, certain low-risk countries will not be subject to the two-week quarantine for those entering the UK.  The list of exempt destinations includes France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway and Switzerland.  The policy is due to be reviewed regularly, with more countries added as they meet the governmentâs criteria, or removed if there is a spike in coronavirus cases, as was observed in Spain.  While previously the government said the list would be reviewed every few weeks, this will now be done more regularly.  The DfT said in a statement: âGovernment will update GOV.UK with any changes on a weekly basis (should any be required) to reflect the shifting international health picture. We are prepared to respond rapidly if the health situation of a country deteriorates.â",https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/quarantine-summer-holiday-uk-self-isolate-coronavirus-a9569216.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,90c17da50d1237d1bf39c030b6a34e76f91adf051784ff2fcecfe45ff6f465c8,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:20:10.946861,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 09:09:53 GMT",Georgia governor accused of being âout of stepâ after passing new legal protections for police officers,"The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a contribution.  Georgia Governor Brian Kemp on Wednesday signed into law a new measure providing additional legal protections to police officers, a step that critics say is flawed and out of step with nationwide efforts to make officers more accountable for their actions.  House Bill 838 creates a new crime: bias-motivated intimidation, which would apply to the death or serious bodily injury of a police officer, firefighter or emergency medical technician. The crime would also apply any time someone causes more than $500 (Â£379.6) in damage to property owned by police, firefighters or emergency medical technicians because of âactual or perceived employment as a first responderâ.  The measure was passed alongside a new bill penalising hate crimes in Georgia. Senate Republicans originally sought to include first responders as a protected class in the hate crimes bill, but a furious revolt by Democrats threatened to sink the effort, especially because some Republicans opposed the hate crimes bill.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Faced with pressure from business groups and the possibility of national embarrassment after the February death of Ahmaud Arbery â which federal authorities are investigating as a possible white-on-black hate crime â legislative leaders agreed to strip first-responder protection from the hate crimes bill. But Republicans then separately rammed through the police protections bill with almost no Democratic support.  Although giving police more protections goes against a national climate of demands for more police accountability after George Floyd's death in Minneapolis, it was no surprise that Mr Kemp signed the measure. He has repeatedly called for Georgia to âback the blueâ and called out the National Guard to protect state office buildings after a girl was shot by armed men on 4 July during a protest at the site of a fast food restaurant where Atlanta police had shot a black man named Rayshard Brooks the month before. Mr Kemp contended that the city of Atlanta couldn't provide adequate protection.  âHouse Bill 838 is a step forward as we work to protect those who are risking their lives to protect us,â Mr Kemp said in a statement Wednesday after he signed the measure. âWhile some vilify, target, and attack our men and women in uniform for personal or political gain, this legislation is a clear reminder that Georgia is a state that unapologetically backs the blue.â  The crime is punishable by one to five years in prison and a fine of up to $5,000 (Â£3,796). The measure says the sentence must be stacked atop any other criminal conviction and can't be served at the same time and that each violation must be a separate crime. That could lead to long sentences for violations such as vandalism aimed at officers.  The measure also allows police officers to file lawsuits against any person, company or group for infringing on the officer's civil rights âarising out of the officer's performance of official dutiesâ or filing a knowingly false complaint against an officer.  Opponents said the measure was unneeded, in part because Georgia lawmakers several years ago added stiffer penalties for assault against a police officer.  âThe Georgia code already includes more than sufficient protections for police officers,â said Andrea Young, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Georgia. âHB 838 was hastily drafted as a direct swipe at Georgians participating in the Black Lives Matter protests who were asserting their constitutional rights.â  In attempting to persuade the governor to veto the measure, the ACLU argued that the way the bill is written, it could have the unintentional effect of reducing the penalty for killing a police officer from mandatory life in prison to the maximum of five years now specified in the law. Supporters say that won't happen.

But rather than indicating an increased willingness to sanction Mr Trump for misleading posts, the decision to remove them may in fact be in keeping with a longstanding position taken by all of the major social media companies on coronavirus misinformation.  Posts on each of the platform were removed for promoting coronavirus misinformation by suggesting that children are ""almost immune"" to Covid-19. The claims came from an interview the president conducted with Fox News, in which he made the claims, and included clips of that discussion which were then shared onto Mr Trump's official pages.  The decision has brought claims of ""flagrant bias"" from the Trump campaign, which argued that the president was simply stating a fact. ""Social media companies are not the arbiters of truth,"" said Courtney Parella, a spokeswoman with the campaign.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  It has also led to suggestions from onlookers that Facebook and Twitter could be launching a more proactive approach towards the president's posts, especially with the election growing near, and the Trump campaign expected to rely heavily on social media to mobilise its supporters.  Facebook particularly has received sustained criticism from lawmakers and even its own employees for the relatively lax approach it has to Mr Trump's posts, even when they are judged particularly inflammatory or misleading. That the newly removed posts appear to be the first time that Facebook has removed Mr Trump's posts in line with its misinformation policies led some to claim that Facebook might be making an effort to respond to that criticism, and do more to censure and limit the president's posts.  But the sites appear to actually be acting within relatively long-standing rules that were established soon after the coronavirus outbreak spread widely across much of the world. The deletions are in line with rules on both sites that specifically prohibit the sharing of coronavirus misinformation, for fear that it could cause real-world harm.  Facebook, Twitter and YouTube each referenced such rules when announcing the removal.  ""This video includes false claims that a group of people is immune from COVID-19, which is a violation of our policies around harmful COVID misinformation,"" a Facebook spokesperson said. Twitter and YouTube gave similar statements, referencing public rules that ban misinformation about the disease.  All of the social media sites have made explicit that they see misinformation about coronavirus as belonging to a specific category of post, which will attract more strict censure than other posts that break its rules, even those that propagate falsehoods about other issues. As such, the decision by all three sites to remove the recent remarks by Mr Trump may simply be a result of those specific policies.  Both sites have in the past appeared to give the president extra leeway within their rules, because of his high-profile and the newsworthy nature of his posts. As such, they may have been expected to take a similar tactic with coronavirus posts, but some of the sites have already indicated that they will treat Mr Trump's posts on the issue more critically than they might with other topics.

Having short, fair lashes, Iâm always on the lookout for a transformative product to add to my make-up bag.  Urban Decayâs latest offering is its ""lash freak"" mascara, a neon green tube with an unusual looking wand. Costing Â£21, the brand makes some pretty bold claims about its results.  âLash freak is an intensely volumising and lengthening mascara that creates up to 23.6 times more volume and up to 40 per cent more visible lash length with up to 20 hours of longwear,â it says on its website.  Urban Decay is a make-up brand thatâs created some of the most sought after beauty products on the market, from the cult favourite eye potion primer, the all nighter setting spray to keep your carefully applied products in place for hours and of course, the famous naked eyeshadow palettes.  Disclaimer: I own them all, and have re-bought the setting spray many times over the past decade and can wholeheartedly attribute to its staying power.  So when it launched lash freak, I was intrigued to find out if it lived up to its claims of delivering a long-lasting, wide-eyed, dramatic look. After putting it to the test, hereâs my verdict.  You can trust our independent round-ups. We may earn commission from some of the retailers, but we never allow this to influence selections. This revenue helps us to fund journalism across The Independent.  Urban Decay lash freak mascara: Â£21, Urban Decay â buy now  The asymmetrical brush delivers an even coat of product for long-lasting lashes ( Urban Decay )  The brush and how to use it  Living up to its freaky name, the wand on this mascara is pretty different. The asymmetrical, one-sided brush is uniquely shaped, promising to define, lift and volumise all in one.  Rather than having bristles all the way around, they're only on one side â the other side is smooth, with little product on it, designed to lift lashes from the root. Only on the tip of the brush will you find tiny bristles all the way around for your lower lash line.  Itâs sturdy but not heavy and I start by swiping it across all my lashes with the longest bit of the brush. At first, they clump together and for a slight second, I panicked, before going over them a second time to separate them and this time Iâm left with defined, long lashes, just how I like them.  My tip would be to go easy on the first coat, slowly building up the product to customise how dramatic a look youâre going for. The brush makes it easy to manoeuvre around your lashes too, and adding a couple of coats is easily done.  So far, so good, thereâs nothing worse than your lashes sticking together in a tangled, messy heap.  I used the tiny bristles at the tip for my lower lash line, a brilliant feature that allows you to coat them without ending up with Twiggy-esque clumpy strands. It looked good during the Sixties, but that style isn't for me.  As someone who is guaranteed to end up ruining a painstakingly applied eyeshadow with an accidental smudge of mascara, the brush is surprisingly agile and lightweight which I found minimises the risk of mistakes.  According to Urban Decay, the side of the wand with no bristles is designed to give your lashes a lift, so following instructions, I held the curved side at the root of my lashes and err...waited.  The result mimics an eyelash curler, giving a quick boost and instant lift.

It doesnât dry instantly, as some mascaras do, so thereâs room to fix your mistakes, which I greatly appreciated. One Iâd finished and felt happy with the results, my lashes felt lightweight, almost like I was wearing no mascara at all.  It has that traditional mascara scent, but it isnât overwhelming.  Does it last?  Iâve tried many mascaras before where Iâve loved how it looked immediately after application, but after a day of wearing it, it left me looking like a panda.  With this product, my top lashes lasted impeccably, with not a single flake, smudge, crumble or smear or be found.  As itâs now mandatory to wear face coverings when in supermarkets, indoor shopping centres, banks, post offices, travel hubs and shops, as well as on public transport, weâve got another obstacle to contend with when it comes to wearing make-up.  Having adjusted my beauty routine for my mask â including ditching the lipstick for lip balm and trying out more experimental eye looks â big lashes are key for my new go-to style.  As my mask sits securely on my face, thereâs a lot of trapped heat and being on the tube does not help either.  Itâs when wearing a mask that my only gripe comes in as I noticed my bottom lash line started to smudge the longer I wore my mask and I did have to try and hastily remove it in a compact mirror while on the train.  However, when I wore it without a mask, it held up fine, so Iâd recommend leaving your lower lash line bare on the days you have to wear one, to avoid any smudging.  The verdict: Urban Decay lash freak mascara  All in all, this is an impressive new launch from Urban Decay which has created a mascara Iâll definitely be adding into my make-up bag.  The innovative brush is like an eyelash curler and mascara in one, delivering fluttery, lifted lashes that made me look instantly wide awake. The staying power was impressive too, so I'd definitely recommend investing in it.  IndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.

The move comes as the islands struggle to kickstart tourism this summer in the wake of the pandemic.  While Spain was initially on the Foreign Officeâs list of countries exempt from its blanket advisory against all non-essential travel, it was removed on 25 July following a surge in coronavirus cases.

To support us, please consider a contribution.  This week marks 75 years since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan by the US military in August 1945.  An estimated 90,000 to 140,000 people in Hiroshima (up to 39 per cent of the population) and 60,000 to 80,000 people in Nagasaki (up to 32 per cent of the population) were killed by the two nuclear bombs.  To date, the bombs, nicknamed Little Boy and Fat Man, are the only two nuclear weapons deployed in war, and are considered small in comparison to the warheads in nuclear arsenals today.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Their use ushered in a new nuclear age in which superpowers have amassed huge quantities of powerful nuclear weapons.  Londoners would only have âa matter of minutesâ before being warned of an impending nuclear attack, experts have said, with one bomb in today's arsenal enough to wipe out the entire city.  If an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) were to head to London, the warning time would be measured in minutes, not hours, Dr Lyndon Burford, a post-doctoral research associate in the Centre for Science and Security Studies at King's College London, told PA.  âThe Prime Minister would have minutes to make it to a safety bunker,â he said.  When Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, temperatures near the site of the explosion were estimated to be 300,000C (540,000F) - around 300 times hotter than the furnaces used for cremation, so humans nearby were almost instantly vaporised - reduced to their most basic minerals.  But the force of the blast and collapsing buildings was what killed most people. However, survivors from the blast and heat were then exposed to huge amounts of radiation, which ultimately killed thousands more.  According to an Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission report, 6,882 people examined in Hiroshima, and 6,621 people examined in Nagasaki, who were largely within 2,000 metres from the centre of the blast zone and who suffered injuries from the blast and heat, died from complications frequently compounded by acute radiation syndrome (ARS), all within about 20 to 30 days.  In Hiroshima, the thermal heat from the bomb sparked numerous fires, resulting in a firestorm in the city, cremating victims from the blast, killing more people and razing buildings - many of which were made from wood. A firestorm is a phenomenon in which a fire burns with such intensity, storm force winds rush to feed the fire from every point of the compass.

The warheads that bombed the Japanese cities on August 6 and 9 in 1945 achieved blasts of around 15-20 kilotons.  âBy contrast, today's weapons can achieve yields of several hundred, sometimes over 1,000, kilotons, due to the introduction of multi-stage thermonuclear weapon designs during the early years of the Cold War,â Dr Korda said.  âA nuclear detonation of several hundred kilotons over the centre of London would destroy most of the city, and could break windows as far away as Croydon and Walthamstow (just under 10 miles away).â  Dr Burford said he is sceptical of the UK government's assertion that it could respond to a single nuclear use in an urban area to help victims of such an attack, citing a warning given by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 2013 that, as things stand, âthere is no effective way of delivering humanitarian assistance to victims of a nuclear blastâ.  Dr Burford said: âWe have learnt that ionising radiation has a gendered impact - women and girls are disproportionately impacted by the negative effects. We don't know why, but that's what the science says.â  The FAS estimates that around 91 per cent of all nuclear warheads are owned by Russia and the United States, with each having around 4,000 warheads in their military stockpiles.  The military theory of mutually assured destruction (MAD), in which a nuclear attack by one superpower would be met with an overwhelming nuclear counter-attack, thus acting as a deterrent to nuclear warfare, is a hotly debated topic.  Dr Burford said: âMany former military and governmental experts are increasingly pointing out that, even if deterrence did work in some instances - and we can never âknowâ in the scientific sense, because deterrence is an internal, psychological process - in other cases, it is clear that luck played a significant role in preventing the use of nuclear weapons.  âSo, did MAD work? Only if we accept that at a minimum, sometimes we just have to leave it to luck to determine whether or not we have a nuclear war.â  Professor Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general at the Royal United Services Institute, told PA the use of nuclear weapons against the UK is most likely to take place during a time of extreme national crisis or war.  âA deliberate 'bolt from the blue' attack cannot be ruled out altogether, but it is extremely hard to see what an enemy could hope to achieve,â he said.

This purpose-built frame is part of an artwork created by Sam Edward â and is located on top of a silver Mini Cooper, whose boot is full of boxes, tools and a Scrabble of steel letters.  The artist, who is taking an MA in Art and Education Practices at Birmingham City University, then hoists the assemblage into position. It reads: âI do not believe I broke any rules.â  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  If that phrase sounds familiar, it may be because you remember it from the most extraordinary TV moment of the coronavirus crisis.  The location: the rose garden at 10 Downing Street. The occasion: the opportunity for the prime ministerâs chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, to talk about the journey he made on 27 March from his home in London to his parentsâ home in Houghall Woods, with a later side-trip to Barnard Castle.  At the time, strict lockdown was in place across the UK. But as Mr Cummings made clear during his lengthy statement, he did not believe he broke the rules.  âI was worried that if my wife and I were both seriously ill, possibly hospitalised, there was nobody in London that we could reasonably ask to look after our child,â he said.  Mr Cummings maintained his stance when questioned in the garden by the elite of Britainâs political journalists.  That drama, and the journey that lay behind it, led to the creation of what Sam Edward calls âa public text pieceâ emulating the excursion.  âThe art is made in the act of driving, or performance,â he says, as he takes down the structure ahead of the final leg: from Houghall Woods to Barnard Castle.  The work had begun with a 5am drive from his home near Birmingham to Mr Cummingsâs house in Islington â which he tracked down through laborious trawling through Google Streetview to match TV footage.  He parked his car outside the adviserâs home, and assembled the phrase: âShe was ill â she might have Covid.â  One passer-by, a man in his forties, said: âThatâs a bit much, isnât it.â But 30 seconds later a woman in her thirties with a dog praised the concept as âbrilliant,â and took a picture.

The artist livestreamed to his followers on Instagram before setting off for the 270-mile drive north â which, unlike Mr Cummings, Sam Edward was unable to make without stopping.  In Durham, he met the cityâs MP, Labourâs Mary Foy, before venturing into the quiet woodland lanes south of the city to display the assertion of innocence by Boris Johnsonâs chief adviser.  Then he set the controls for the heart of Barnard Castle, as Mr Cummings had done on Easter Sunday.  âMy wife was very worried, particularly given my eyesight seemed to have been affected by the disease,â the audience in the rose garden heard from the adviser.  âShe didnât want to risk a nearly 300-mile drive with our child, given how ill I had been. We agreed that we should go for a short drive to see if I could drive safely. We drove for roughly half an hour and ended up on the outskirts of Barnard Castle.â  âYou can start to see why he would want to come up here,â says Sam Edward, as he passes the honey-and-cream cottages in the village of Staindrop â the Cotswold-like overture to Barnard Castle.  âItâs a lovely part of the world.â  It is also an artistic part of the world. On the outskirts of Barnard Castle is a formidable hillside chateau that was home to the coal baron, John Bowes, and his Parisian actress wife JosÃ©phine.  While that collection features fine tapestries and Spanish masterpieces, its most celebrated exhibit is the 18th-century clockwork-powered Silver Swan, with performance art daily at 2pm.  Sam Edwardâs Barnard Castle performance, meanwhile, âis part of a collection of work that discusses art and politics, peeling away the facades of political languageâ. He is on the political left, but lost confidence in Jeremy Corbyn over anti-semitism in the Labour Party.  After a brief sat-nav altercation is addressed with the intervention of The Independentâs Ordnance Survey map, he parks beside the imposing walls of the ruined castle at the heart of the town.  âHave you come to have your eyes tested?â asks Dave Anderson, who was Labour MP for Blaydon until 2017 and now lives locally.  âItâs made us the laughing stock of the world, thanks to Mr Cummings and his friend, Boris.  âBut we donât care because we love the place, itâs a gem. Itâs Englandâs last wilderness, but itâs wonderful.â  Tom Maloney, landlord of the Coach and Horses, chimes in by announcing: âWe do have a very good Specsavers, may I say? It used to be a Clarks shoe shop.â  The publican, who happens to be a former Butlins redcoat, says of Dominic Cummings: âHe did something silly. If I were him, I would apologise, put it to bed, job done.â  Another resident, Jean Winter, says: âUnfortunately, itâs put us on the political mapâ. But she supports Mr Cummings.  âHis trip to Barnard Castle may have been in breach of lockdown, but I donât think he wanted lockdown â he wanted to do herd immunity.  âI wonât say what I did in lockdown, but it was pretty similar.â  As the last of the August sun flickers against the castle walls, Sam Edward prepares the finale â with not one message from the past, but two.  The first reads: âI behaved reasonably.â Once it is in position, he perches on a small stepladder and discusses the work and its wider political context with another Birmingham-based artist, Adam Neal, via Zoom.  âThe project was made in rage. Itâs now condensed down to a disappointment: that there is one rule for them, another for everybody else,â says Sam Edward. âPerhaps contempt is the word.â  The conversation will linger on as a podcast at the artistâs channel, @thisisasoapbox, just as Mr Cummingsâs conclusion has done online: âI know the British people hate the idea of unfairness.  âI wanted to explain what I thought, what I did and why, over this period, because I think that people like me who helped to make the rules should be accountable for their actions.â  As night infiltrates the far west of County Durham, Sam Edwardâs final public text message takes shape â revealing the claimed reason for the side trip to Barnard Castle.  âTo test my eyesigt.â  A deliberate misspelling or simply a mistake made in the gathering gloom at the end of a motoring and cultural marathon? The creator wonât say.  âIâm just one artist, trying to make a difference.â",https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/dominic-cummings-barnard-castle-sam-edward-artwork-durham-lockdown-coronavirus-pandemic-a9656756.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,064ee17e2651791b22735462f536df7bb09eb489792adf15254dd43f08d89280,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

More than half of Tesco customers think that the UKâs largest supermarket chain is putting shoppers at risk with plans to axe thousands of professional cleaners during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a poll.  Last month, the supermarket announced it would get rid of contracted cleaners in its Express and Metro stores, with shop-floor staff taking on the work instead.

To support us, please consider a contribution.  News of the explosion in Beirut came first through my family WhatsApp group. Rumours flew from one theory to the next before we understood the cause of the mushroom cloud to be almost 3,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse at the docks. Watching videos of the damage caused, and speaking to friends and family, my overwhelming feelings are of immeasurable sadness and humanitarian concern for a country already at breaking point.  Iâd moved back to Lebanon about four years ago, to work with Doctors Without Borders in a refugee camp in a suburb of the capital. Even then, the health sector was stretched. The neighbouring war had seen the influx of a million Syrians in addition to the 475,000 refugees already from Palestine; with one in every four inhabitants a refugee - Lebanon is the country with the highest number of refugees per capita. For a country half the size of Wales, the rapid population growth was palpable, not least with the pressure placed on infrastructure, services and the economy.  Towards the end of 2019 I started to hear rumblings of concern from family and friends. Despite massive debt, the economy had managed to remain relatively stable until the Lebanese lira, for years artificially pegged to the dollar at a fixed rate, went into freefall. The months that followed saw protests across the country. A monthly salary of 750,000LP dropped in value from $500 (Â£414) to $75 (Â£62). Nearly half the population now officially live below the poverty line and many are unable to afford food. Last month, a there was a death by suicide on a popular high street, with the man leaving a note with a line from a song - âIâm not a hereticâ - which ends, âbut hunger is heresyâ.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  It is on this backdrop: refugee crisis, economic crisis, massive debt, electricity shortages, and years of corruption, that coronavirus hit. Just five days ago, hospitals declared that they would be inundated within a fortnight, unable to care for the rising numbers of coronavirus cases in the context of scarce medical supplies, an inability to pay staff, and a lack of electricity.  A catastrophe like that which hit Beirut on Tuesday would be horrific for any country, but for Lebanon the timing couldnât be worse. The majority of grain supplies have been lost in the explosion and the port is destroyed. 300,000 people have been left homeless. At least four hospitals were severely damaged by the blast.  This is now undoubtedly a humanitarian emergency. Whilst prayers and platitudes may warm the heart, they do little to tangibly change the reality for those on the ground. For those of us watching heartbroken from the UK, now seems an apt time to reflect on the merger of the Foreign Office with the Department for International Development. The latter is internationally recognised for its aid effectiveness and humanitarian responsiveness - exactly what countries like Lebanon need.  While Boris Johnson did today state that âthe UK is ready to support in any way we canâ, similar mergers of foreign and development departments in countries such as Australia and Canada have impacted both the quantity and quality of aid delivered.  To be able to respond to humanitarian crises based solely on need, and not for security or diplomatic interests as is risked by such a merger, is an asset we should not let go of so freely. Right now, Lebanon needs friends to provide healthcare professionals, medicines, grains, disaster expertise and financial support, and to do so without leveraging either personal political interest or corrupt Lebanese politics that brought us to this point.

During a live report on Tuesday (4 August), the reporter captured the extraordinary moment the group were seen travelling from France to the UK on an inflatable boat filling with water.

Itâs certainly a lot more than theyâd be getting in France,â Swain said. âThe chances of them being deported is pretty slim, even though they entered the country illegally.â  Describing the Home Officeâs response to the original broadcast as âstrong [and] toughâ, he continued: âThey say the migrants had no right to leave France, they have every right to stay there, they should claim asylum over there.  âTheyâre trying to negotiate a deal with the French authorities and coast guards to do more, to stop them in the sea and turn them back to France.

Netflixâs hit series returned on Friday (31 July), and has been criticised by many viewers for including a corrupt organisation whose evil boss, known as The Handler, is shown speaking Yiddish, the language almost exclusively spoken by Ashkenazi Jews.  The same character â played by Kate Walsh â also appeared in the first season, which prompted The Board of Deputies of British Jews to write an open letter against the series.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  âThe use of a Yiddish saying by the evil boss of an organisation which controls the worldâs timeline is clearly an anti-Semitic trope,â Amanda Bowman, Vice President of the board, wrote.  âWhether intentional or not, this makes for very uncomfortable viewing. Netflix should take action to remove the racism from this scene.â  Following the controversy, fans were shocked to see that the character was still using the language in new episodes.  One viewer said they believed its inclusion to be âdeliberateâ when considering the uproar it caused in 2019.  The show's co-creator, Steve Blackman, has defended the show from the criticism, saying claims of antisemitism are ""hurtful and factually incorrect"". Read his full response here.  In season two, The Handler can also be seen speaking Mandarin and Swedish, which one viewer said begs the question: âWhy have her speak Yiddish when she could speak ANY other language?â  TikTok user @nyarchivist accused the show of âantisemitic dog whistlingâ in a video about the series.  âHaving the villain speak that language is [saying], âLook at these big Jewish villains, arenât they vile, look at their gross language.â That is what it is. That is what itâs always been, because society is built on believing that Jewish people control everything. That is antisemitism.â  Another viewer added: âI donât know what to tell you, The Umbrella Academy having the âsecret world domination cultâ speaking Yiddish is definitely, intentionally antisemitic.â  The Umbrella Academy, which first aired in 2019, is an adaptation of My Chemical Romance singer Gerard Wayâs comic book series of the same name.

With sun, sea and dolmades, Greece has long been a popular travel destination for Britons in need of some vitamin D.  But can British holidaymakers get there? And will we even be welcome?  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Hereâs everything you need to know.  Am I allowed to travel to Greece from the UK?  The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) issued a blanket warning against all non-essential international travel in March, but this has now been lifted for more than 80 destinations.  Greece was on this list, meaning Britons can now visit there without invalidating their travel insurance.  How could I get there?  Air links with the UK were suspended in March, but got the go-ahead to to resume from 15 July.  EasyJet has been flying to Thessaloniki and Corfu since 16 and 19 July respectively. It started flights from London to Athens on 23 July and to Mykonos on 24 July.  Flights have been available with Ryanair from London to Athens starting 26 July; to Corfu from 19 July; and to Thessaloniki from 16 July.  Wizz, Aegean and British Airways are also offering flights to various Greek destinations.  Will they let me in when I arrive?  Yes. Finally, as of 15 July, Brits are allowed back into the country again, though with some stipulations.  Travellers must complete an online Passenger Locator Form (PLF) at least 24 hours before their arrival in Greece. The form is online, in English.  Once you have completed the form, you will receive an email acknowledgement and, in a separate email, a QR code. This code is likely to be sent up to 24 hours before travel, regardless of how early the form is filled in.  Shape Created with Sketch.

You will need to show your code to Greek authorities on your arrival into the country, and some airlines may also ask to see it before they let you board. A British mother of two was recently denied boarding by easyJet on a flight to Greece because the airline claimed she had not filled in the forms correctly.  When you arrive in Greece, the authorities will scan the QR code and may direct you for health screening (including testing for coronavirus).  Failure to fill in the form may result in a â¬500 fine or the Greek authorities barring you from entering the country.  If you are travelling by ferry to Greece, the ferry operator will ask you to complete an additional form (âPre Boarding Informationâ), alongside your PLF. This additional form will be provided by the ferry operator, either via their website, or at booking offices: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding.  Will I have to quarantine when I arrive?  Possibly.  According to the Foreign Office, the Greek authorities may require you to undergo testing for coronavirus as part of a health screening when you arrive in Greece. Any passenger may be asked to undergo a test, but you are more likely to be asked if youâve arrived from a country outside of the EU (including the UK), either directly or via indirect flights.  After testing, youâll need to self-isolate at the address given on your PLF form until you receive the results, which should be available within 24 hours.  If your test is negative, you will no longer need to self-isolate. If your test result is positive, the Greek authorities are likely to ask you to quarantine for 14 days. Depending on the nature of your accommodation, you may be instructed to move to government-provided accommodation, the costs of which will be paid by the Greek authorities.  Be aware that even if you donât have coronavirus, you may be asked to self-isolate if someone else from your flight tests positive.  Can I travel within Greece including between Greek islands?  Yes. Flights are operating within the country, and travelling throughout Greece, including the islands, has been permitted since 25 May.  If youâre travelling via ferry, you will need to complete a health questionnaire and hand it to the ferry operator before boarding, according to the FCO. âThe necessary forms will be provided by the operator: you should contact them directly if you need further information. Temperature checks may also be carried out before boarding; and it is obligatory to wear masks on all ferries, whose capacity is limited to allow for social distancing.â  Those travelling on internal domestic flights will also be required to wear a mask. Specific measures relating to check-in, baggage allowances and other details are in place to reduce the spread of coronavirus.  Be aware that Greeceâs borders with most neighbouring countries (Turkey, Albania and North Macedonia) are closed to passenger traffic, although the border with Bulgaria is open.  Are hotels open?  Yes. Previously only year-round hotels could open but, as of 15 June, seasonal hotels in tourist destinations have also been allowed to admit guests.  Airbnb accommodation also remains available.  Are restaurants, shops and attractions open?  Restaurants, fast-food joints, bars, internet cafes, shops and open-air nightclubs have been open since 6 June.  From 15 June, museums, historic buildings and areas, theme parks, gyms, saunas, spas and thermal springs have also been able to open to visitors, albeit with new rules in place, such as limiting the number of customers per square metre.  Archaeological sites are now operating on extended summer hours (8am-8pm) and visitor numbers per hour are capped to avoid overcrowding.  What rules are in place?  You must wear a face mask at all times when on an aeroplane or ferry travelling to or from Greece and whilst at airports. Itâs mandatory to wear face masks on public transport (including ferries), in taxis, in all medical facilities and in lifts, plus in supermarkets, cafes, banks, government offices, retail shops, barbershops, hairdressers and related establishments.  Travel in a private car or a taxi is limited to a maximum of three adult passengers per vehicle, in addition to the driver. Any children in the vehicle do not count towards this limit.  Will I have to quarantine when I come home?  Not anymore.  Although the government implemented a blanket two-week quarantine for all inbound arrivals on 8 June, from 10 July this was lifted for certain countries.  Places regarded as âlow-riskâ by the Joint Biosecurity Centre â which was set up to coordinate the governmentâs response to the pandemic â are now exempt from mandatory self-isolation.

A judge has since ruled she should be extradited to the US.  Since then China has arrested two Canadians on suspicion of spying and sentenced at least two others to death on drug charges.  The Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate Court said on Thursday that Xu and Chinese accomplice Wen Guanxiong were found guilty of making 265 pounds of Ketamine in October 2016, according to the state-run Yangcheng Evening News.  Prosecutors said Xu had purchased raw ingredients and tools before cooking up the drug in a villa belonging to his Wen â who was sentenced to life in prison.

After the news made national headlines, her family were forced to move out of Maryland. The case was eventually dropped, which Colemanâs family claimed was due to the fact Barnettâs family had local political connections.  Coleman went on to co-found SafeBAE (Before Anyone Else), a non-profit organisation focused on stopping sexual assault among school students, as well as helping young survivors.  A statement released by SafeBAE said: â[We are] shattered and shocked by her passing.â  âShe had many coping demons and had been facing and overcoming them all, but as many of you know, healing is not a straight path or any easy one.

The twin brothers are known for their popular series of prank videos, and have more than 25 million TikTok followers (and 4 million on YouTube).

To support us, please consider a contribution.  Donald Trump appeared to double down on a claim that the Beirut explosion may have been a deliberate attack, despite Lebanon officials suggesting it was the result of a neglected store ammonium nitrate.  Following Tuesdayâs huge blast, which has killed at least 135 people and destroyed large swathes of the city, Mr Trump told a White House briefing that the âterrible attackâ may have been caused by a bomb.  Trump said US generals told him that the explosion could have been planned. âThey seem to think it was an attack,â he said. âIt was a bomb of some kind, yes,â Trump added, in comments that left defence chiefs scrambling to explain the presidentâs position.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  On Wednesday, defence secretary Mark Esper appeared to contradict his boss, saying that most believe the explosion âwas an accident, as reportedâ.  It is understood the blast was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been left in a warehouse in Beirutâs port for around seven years, without adequate safety precautions, according to Lebanese president Michel Aoun.  Mr Aoun has promised a transparent probe into the catastrophic blast and vowed to punish those who are responsible. Lebanonâs cabinet has placed all of Beirutâs port officials on house arrest while the investigation takes place.  Ammonium nitrate is an agricultural fertiliser that can become deadly if left to deteriorate and ignited by fire. According to documents circulating in Lebanon, the lethal cargo of ammonium nitrate docked in Beirut in 2013 on a Russian-owned ship flying a Moldovan flag.  Customs agents repeatedly appealed to Beirut officials to have the fertiliser removed, but their requests were ignored, according to the documents.  Despite growing evidence that the blast was caused by neglected ammonium nitrate, Trump continued to insist that the explosion may have been the result of an attack.  âHow can you say accident if somebody left some terrible explosive-type devices and things around perhaps â perhaps it was that. Perhaps it was an attack,â Trump said in a White House briefing on Wednesday after Mr Esper had already spoken to the media.

Weâre looking into it very strongly right now.â  Trump added: âSome people think it was an attack and some people think it wasnât. In any event, it was a terrible event and a lot of people were killed and a tremendous number of people were badly wounded, injured. And weâre standing with that country.  âBut whether it was a bomb intentionally set off â it ended up being a bomb. But no, Iâve heard it both ways. It could have been an accident and it could have also been something that was very offensive.â  White House chief of staff Mark Meadows defended his bossâs comments, claiming that Trump had only repeated what military officials had told him on Tuesday.  âThe president shared with the American people what he was briefed on, with 100 per cent certainty I can tell you that,â Meadows told CNN.  But US officials on Wednesday couldnât identify any âgeneralsâ who delivered any such Beirut message to the president, Associated Press reported.

The party is urging the education secretary to step in after what it called the âdisastrous handlingâ of results in Scotland where 125,000 marks â a quarter of the total â were lowered.  Some 15.2 per cent were cut in the poorest communities, compared with just 6.9 per cent in the most affluent areas, Labour said â because âprior attainmentâ in schools was used.

In a letter to education secretary Gavin Williamson, Ms Green wrote: âItâs imperative the government acts now to reassure worried students, teachers and parents.  âYoung people deserve to have their hard work assessed on merit, but the system risks baking in inequality and doing most harm to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, those from ethnic minority groups and those with special educational needs and disabilities.â  Results are calculated using estimates made by teachers based on a pupil's performance over the school year but are then moderated.

To support us, please consider a contribution.  The staggering videos from the Lebanese capital are grimly familiar to Tommy Muska thousands of miles away in Texas: a towering blast, a thundering explosion and shock waves demolishing buildings with horrifying speed.  It is what the mayor of West, Texas, lived seven years ago when one of the deadliest fertiliser plant explosions in US history partly levelled his rural town. On Wednesday, Mr Muska also couldn't shake a familiar feeling â that yet again, no lessons will be learned.  âI don't know what people were thinking about storing that stuff,â Mr Muska told The Associated Press. He was a volunteer firefighter at the time of the West explosion.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  The 2013 disaster at the West Fertiliser Company was a fraction of the size of Tuesday's explosion at Beirut's port that authorities say killed least 135 people and wounded about 5,000. Both blasts involved massive stockpiles of ammonium nitrate, a common but highly explosive chemical, and swift allegations that negligence and weak government oversight were to blame.  Few significant crackdowns on chemical storage came in the wake of the West explosion, which killed 15 people. President Donald Trump has scaled back industrial safety and disaster regulations enacted in direct response to the tragedy in Texas.  With a government mired in factional fighting and corruption, Lebanon offers an extreme example of what was once a bustling business economy operating now under little dependable regulation and enforcement.  The investigation is focusing on how a reported 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate came to be stored at the facility for six years and why nothing was done about it. The chemical had been stored at the port since it was confiscated from a ship in 2013. On Tuesday it is believed to have detonated when a fire started nearby.  In Texas, authorities suspected arson but no arrests have been made. The West explosion had the force of a small earthquake. It flattened homes in a five-block radius and destroyed a nursing home where residents, some in wheelchairs, were trapped in rubble. Ten of those killed in the blast were firefighters or first responders.  âWe don't seem to learn that chemical is deadly,â Mr Muska said. âI feel for those people in Beirut, I surely do. It brought back a lot of memories.â  Last year, the Trump administration scaled back chemical safety measures that included ending a requirement that plants provide members of the public information about chemical risks upon request. Chemical manufacturers had pushed for the changes.

Others include stripping a Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposed rule that would have required nuclear plants to greatly harden their facilities against the kind of natural disasters that struck the plant in Fukushima, Japan.  Other steps cut proposed safety requirements for offshore rigs after the Deepwater Horizon explosion, and allowed shipment of liquefied natural gas by rail despite criticism from several states, firefighters and the National Transportation Safety Board.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which has trimmed scores of environmental and public health protections that the Trump administration sees as unfriendly to business, did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday about the rollback.  At the time, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the weakening of the proposed Chemical Disaster Rule would save $88m (Â£66.9m) a year in compliance costs. Mr Wheeler said the administration's move âaddresses emergency responders' longstanding concerns and maintains important public safety measuresâ while saving money.  Elena Craft, a Texas-based senior director with the Environmental Defence Fund environmental group, cited the Chemical Disaster Rule among a series of other proposals weakening protections for the communities â often lower-income, and disproportionately black or Hispanic â living around dangerous industrial sites.  Even the West, Texas, disaster, with its toll on first responders, failed to change the regulatory picture much after the headlines faded away, Ms Craft said. âIt's always been sort of the constant story. It gets to be accepted business in Texas.â  In 1989, Juan Flores was in sixth grade when an explosion at a Phillips 66 plastics plant near his Galena Park, Texas, community outside Houston killed 23. The blast shook Mr Flores's school and blew out windows.  That area bordering Houston's Shipping Channel is the nation's hub for oil and gas and petrochemicals. Yet Houston's lack of zoning means residents' yards in poorer and minority neighbourhoods butt up against looming chemical and petroleum storage tanks or booming industrial sites working with hazardous materials.  Six major chemical explosions have rocked the Houston area since March 2019 alone. One, an explosion at a chemical tank, prompted widespread shelter-in-place orders for residents and sent a mile-high plume of smoke over the city for days. A more recent chemical blast, in January, killed three people and damaged more than 450 surrounding buildings.  âTo see that happenâ in Beirut, it was the worst-case scenario for already worried people in his community, said Mr Flores, a community activist and former Galena Park mayor. âThere's one or two plants here, if they ever go, there's a chance we could wind up in that situation.â  In West, street images on Google Maps still show crumbled buildings that were taken shortly after the blast that shook the town of only 3,000 people. âThey've never come back with their little car,â Mr Muska said of Google.  Ammonium nitrate isn't stored in the town any longer. âIt's got its useful places in the farming community,â Mr Muska said. âBut it's also, like we just saw yesterday, it can just be devastating.â  AP",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/beirut-explosion-news-lebanon-2013-texas-west-fertiliser-company-a9656641.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,f9b7a6b7a341c4a2b62f9ef54f4deab9b6458f86834f32701f5ddb959397aea6,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

To support us, please consider a contribution.  âI keep telling them to shout about what theyâre doing, because lots of them arenât right now,â says Jane Pendlebury, CEO of the Hospitality Professionals Association (HOSPA), in exasperation.  She is talking, somewhat frustratedly, about UK hotels and the measures theyâre taking to keep guests safe in the post-Covid era. Which, as it turns out, are awfully extensive.  We all know about the obvious ones â hand sanitiser all over the shop, Plexiglass screens at reception, a complete lack of minibar action once you get inside your room â but thereâs a whole lot more going on behind the scenes.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  âHotels are taking this incredibly seriously,â she says. âThey understand guestsâ confidence is key to their success.â  And therein lies the issue. Consumer confidence is at an all time low, and convincing people to go on holiday, even domestically, after four months hiding from the âinvisible muggerâ as our PM so colourfully put it, is a trickier sell than hoteliers might have imagined.  Half of British travellers donât trust hotel hygiene after lockdown, according to a survey of 1,894 respondents conducted by End of Tenancy Cleaning Company. Some 42 per cent of those polled even said they would clean a hotel room themselves before using it.  Ironically, it should be a prime time for UK properties to cash in, while so few of us are venturing abroad. Out of 2,000 Brits surveyed, more than a third (36 per cent) said they would avoid all international travel for the next 12 months, according to research from personal finance comparison website finder.com.  But while some UK hotels are managing to reap the rewards of their location â coastal properties in popular seaside destinations, for instance â others are left twiddling their thumbs, waiting for a summer that feels like it may never come.  âRural locations are picking up, but not at quite speed I would have expected them to,â says Jane. But the real casualties so far are city centre hotels. Many arenât reopening till September; some may not ever reopen. London, home to more than 150,000 hotel rooms, has not seen much recovery at all since restrictions eased and overnight stays became possible again from 4 July.  Itâs a particular blow given that 2020 was due to be a bumper year for the capital, with the highest number of openings â nearly 8,000 rooms across 65 new hotels â ever recorded set to take place.

But whatâs heartbreaking about the lack of consumer confidence is that hotels are working harder than they have in their entire existence to keep properties clean and guests safe.  Just hearing about all the new measures makes my head spin: leaving rooms fallow for 48 to 72 hours; deep cleans between every guest stay; digital keys that have required every hotel door to be modified; QR codes instead of restaurant menus; one-way systems; regular staff health and temperature checks; employees put in âbubblesâ that work the same shift patterns to limit any potential virus spread.  âIf youâre nervous about staying at a hotel, just ring them up and ask them what extra measures theyâre taking,â recommends Jane.  A huge number of properties have signed up to one of two new schemes designed to outline best practice for hotels here in the UK. Both the AAâs Covid Confident programme and Visit Britainâs Weâre Good To Go industry standard give accommodation providers a detailed guide on how to change the way they operate to protect both staff and guests. These comprehensive plans should reassure even the most anxious of travellers â and checking if the place youâre planning on staying is signed up to one of them is one of the easiest ways to give yourself a confidence boost.  In fact, some luxury hotel chains are going even further, splashing the cash on creating their own private partnerships to give guests peace of mind. For instance, Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts offers Lead with Care, which includes a consulting agreement with Johns Hopkins Medicine International; Montage International has partnered with One Medical to deliver 24/7 digital health services to guests; and Preferred Hotels & Resorts, Accor Hotels, Las Vegas Sands Corp and Melia International have all partnered with Bureau Veritas, which offers a Safe Guard Hygiene Excellence Label programme affiliated with Cleveland Clinic, to help hotels reopen safely. Safety, it would seem, is the new luxury.  Which is good, because other luxuries might not be quite as we remember them from brighter days.  âThose extra five-star luxuries wonât be able to continue in quite same way,â warns Jane, citing a lack of valet parking and bellboys to help with the luggage. Guests will notice other differences too â they may find they have to choose their breakfast sitting in advance, are presented with a reduced restaurant menu, are encouraged to order room service, and canât use the pool and spa without booking ahead.  Breakfast buffets are pretty much a thing of the past, as is early check-in and late check-out. But once youâre ensconced in your room, the experience really is just as enjoyable, as I discovered during my first hotel stay in four months. If anything, itâs even more of a pleasure to escape for a night after spending the entirety of lockdown looking at the same four walls.  And, thereâs no two ways about it: the UK tourism industry desperately needs our help right now. âIt is crucial that we return,â stresses Jane. âThere are hotels that cannot afford to reopen. Those that are reopening need the support of the British public and visitors more than ever.â  Most hotels donât run on big margins; they are not quite the money-making machines we imagine them to be. And during lockdown, theyâve still had costs and overheads without income.  Forget Eat Out to Help Out â what about Sleep Out to Help Out? A night away could just help the hospitality industry get back on its feet.",https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/hotels/uk-hotels-coronavirus-safe-clean-measures-covid-19-a9655806.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,962c370bbc2948e3e37509fc1f4c3c84b5464fb2db3e383aab1e56194cc801e8,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

To support us, please consider a contribution.  Those at Manchester City couldnât help noticing a frustration to Kevin De Bruyne.  It wasnât about losing footballer of the year to Jordan Henderson, mind. While many at the club were irritated about that, De Bruyne himself wasnât that bothered.  He knows his own value. The Belgian once told people at a corporate function he is âthe most intelligent player in the worldâ.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Many, including manager Pep Guardiola, are going even further and talking about him maybe being the best in the world outright. Lionel Messi is fighting the tide at Barcelona, Cristiano Ronaldo is by now fighting the effects of physical wear at Juventus.  For all the debate about what might have been missing from De Bruyneâs Premier League season to win footballer of the year, though, there is one thing missing from his career. It is what really does separate the gameâs elite.  That is a dominant campaign in the Champions League, and defining performances.  This is what has frustrated him, all the more so since City failed to win the league this season. It was a frustration that was especially seen after last seasonâs elimination to Tottenham Hotspur. Putting such exasperation to good effect may well be the difference between City winning the competition and not, or even just getting past the last eight.  It is remarkable that, at 29, De Bruyne has only played in one semi-final. That was a fairly ineffective display in 2015-16 under Manuel Pellegrini, against â of course â Real Madrid.  The Spanish champions now block Cityâs path, and thereâs never been a better time for De Bruyne to produce.  He personally feels in the form of his life. He was already the game-changer in the 2-1 first-leg victory. He now just needs to take charge of the whole competition. It is what players of his talent do. It is what the worldâs best do. It is what the game demands. That is the way the modern game is built.  Since the Champions League expanded in 1999-2000 to include the top four from the major leagues, it is virtually impossible for any major talent to not be regularly involved. The self-perpetuating finances of the competition only fortify this, intensifying its gravitational pull.  Weâre in a different world to the days when Diego Maradona only played in two seasons of the European Cup, or Roberto Baggio barely featured. If you go through the podiums of the Ballon DâOr over the last two decades â as a rudimentary guide for recognition in the game â virtually all of those who have made the top three have had some lasting impact in the Champions League latter stages.  The reality is that they now play in the competition so much, and have so much quality, that itâs virtually inevitable they show it.  The only exceptions on that podium over that time are really Michael Owen in 2001 and Fabio Cannavaro in 2006, and both of those were before the super-club era really took form, so had their best performances in other competitions.  If you want to look at that super-club era, and extend it to the Ballon DâOr top 10 or those widely considered âstarsâ of the game over the last decade, weâre only really talking about Eden Hazard, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Robin van Persie andâ¦ pretty much all of Manchester Cityâs prime players. They are the only exceptions, who didnât quite excel in the latter stages of the Champions League.  It does stand out.  Some of this is obviously circumstantial. Thereâs the pot luck of a knock-out competition like the Champions League, and also Cityâs own struggles in it. Some of De Bruyneâs own displays point to both.  The Belgian was influential in his first quarter-final with City, scoring in both legs in the victory over Paris Saint-Germain in 2015-16, only for Madrid to exploit the stagnation of the Pellegrini era in that semi-final tie.  His best display in the competition until this season was last yearâs quarter-final second leg against Spurs, where he produced a hat-trick of assists. They displayed his range of talents in different ways.  The first was a measured midfield pass for Raheem Sterling. The second, also for the forward, was one of those drilled balls that has so much quality contained within the delivery that itâs hard to know whether to describe it as a cross, a through pass or something else altogether. The third was then a combination of the drive and delicacy that so rounds him as a player. De Bruyne weaved his way through the Spurs defence from deep, before deftly releasing Sergio Aguero to smash the ball into the roof of the net.  It might well have been the tieâs crowning moment, but that game was instead capped by two VAR calls. Mere millimetres had massive effect.  Such are the wild, almost uncontrollable swings of modern knock-out football. This is why success can sometimes just be beyond players, regardless of what they do.  A counter-argument to all that, however, is that the very greatest players impose their will regardless. The romanticised view is that the elite elevate themselves even above the intangibles of the game. It is why Messi and Ronaldo are so held up.  The reality is more complex, and even both of those totems have been victims of events well outside their control in the competition. Look at Messi in 2010 or 2012, Ronaldo in 2012 or 2019.  The true value is in persevering despite that. Thatâs where greatness really resides. That is an attitude De Bruyne now typifies. He wants to take command. He wants to drive teammates to a greater level.  One problem that City have arguably had in the Champions League is that they are âa squad of nice guysâ. It was something Ibrahimovic himself once referred to, disparagingly describing that great Barcelona squad as âlike schoolboysâ.  The number of trophies they won significantly undercuts the Swedeâs complaint, but there is some merit in his point when it comes to one-off games.  It is arguable that Guardiolaâs system requires obedient personalities to fully work, and this will generally be spectacularly successful over the course of a full season, but that a lack of old-fashioned âbastardsâ â to put it as Brian Clough once did â might cost them amid the intensity of do-or-die knock-out games.  Those occasions are when you need a bit more than gifted players who can dutifully execute a system, since these are matches that go much deeper; that warrant greater levels of emotional reserve.  This might be why City need more from De Bruyne in that regard.  Everyone who knows him says he is developing that personality. They talk of how he now admonishes teammates for missing chances, especially so when he was chasing Thierry Henryâs Premier League assist record.  They add heâs âhard on them â but in a fair wayâ. Heâs now super focused. He knows the stakes, the kind of status he and the club need to be at.  De Bruyne is aiming for much more than individual trophies. He knows itâs time to deliver in the grandest stages of greatest club competition.",https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/man-city-vs-real-madrid-uefa-champions-league-2020-kevin-de-bruyne-a9656766.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,3ee7795657c5f7e4e66e7b9ce74aa42a9352bd02bd26c46cb0b4c42269f51e32,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

From glasses that improve your visibility, high-vis jackets to make yourself known to drivers and other cyclists on the road or elbow pads to cushion a fall, weâve created a shopping list for the must-haves.  As the weather in the UK can be temperamental, items you need, such as bike lights, will come in handy no matter what terrain youâre venturing onto.  In our guide on how to start cycling, Sam Jones from Cycling UK told The Independent: âCycling remains one of the best in terms of safely maintaining social distancing.â  Itâs an ideal way to catch up with friends or family, while getting some exercise in, all while easily adhering to social distancing measures.  Not to mention, it's a good way to avoid coming into close contact with people if you're feeling wary about being in public spaces.  So before you head out onto the road, make sure youâve checked these products off your list, so you can be as safe, secure and as comfortable as possible.  You can trust our independent round-ups.

Helmets for adults  It goes without saying that you should always wear a helmet, to keep you cool, agile and most importantly protected.  The POC omne air spin (Sigma Sports, Â£125) impressed us in our IndyBest guide to cycling helmets, that's aimed at gravel riders, road racers and commuters.  It was the rounded design with a shiny hard shell finish that fits well that won our reviewer over, along with the nice thin straps and a highly adjustable retention cradle.  This Abus stormchaser (Cycle Solutions, Â£116.99) topped our guide, which is designed for all types of riders.  We found it to be lightweight, aerodynamic and super-comfortable. It also has seven vents at the front to draw in cool air, with another 16 exhaust ports to get rid of it.  Our reviewer said: âThere are some great design details to look out for â you can slot your sunglasses into the rear-facing arm holders while climbing hills and the lay-flat chin straps can be popped out when you need to wash them. The padding is minimal and thereâs a dial at the back to adjust the cradle, the position of which you can also raise or lower.""  Helmets for kids  Surprisingly, children riding a bicycle, scooter, skateboard, or anything on wheels aren't required by law to wear a helmet. But to give parents space of mind and protect little heads from injuries, we would highly recommend encouraging them to wear one.  Thanks to modern designs thereâs plenty of colourful patterns that are both comfortable and safe, which will make wearing them simple, rather than lead to a tantrum.  According to our reviewer: âThe hard-body shell and impact absorbing features are ideal for serious mini cyclists, skateboarders or any child that spends more time riding on hard pavements than soft grass.â  It has well-thought-out features from a moulded anti-insect net to anti-allergenic padding and we found it to be a sensible choice if you tend to take your child on evening cycling trips, as it has a rear LED light fitted into the adjustment band, so your child will be seen both off or on road.  âThis style is adjustable from 52 to 57cm, ensuring the helmet will grow along with them and even our young tester became quite attached to wearing it, with very little persuasion â and that in itself makes it value for money.""  Hi-vis jacket  If you are going out when it's dark, make sure you have a high visibility jacket to keep you safe.  In our round-up of the best reflective cycling jackets for women, we tested totally reflective jackets that make you glow in the dark to smart hi-vis gilets and the winner was the Reflect360 plus women's cycling jacket (Proviz Sports, Â£119.99).  This fully reflective jacket will make you very visible at night, especially if you're cycling on poorly lit roads  Itâs covered with millions of tiny glass beads, making it 100 per cent reflective at night time, but it will still look completely normal by day.  Our reviewer noticed the biggest change in driversâ behaviour when riding in this jacket: cars gave her more space, and because the whole sleeve lights up, she felt much safer signalling turns on dark roads.  The jacket is waterproof but mesh-lined and has great ventilation, which means you donât feel uncomfortably sweaty on long rides. Other features are quietly luxurious: the fleece-lined collar, generous chest and back pockets, for example.  For men, our favourite is the Lusso aqua pro extreme (Lusso, Â£164.99) which we found to work well for training or commuting, as some offices have started to reopen.  Stay warm, dry and visible with this reflective jacket  Itâs windproof, water-resistant and includes attention-grabbing high-vis and reflective details.  âItâs superbly stitched together too, with a form-fitting design which will help you to cut through the wind with no annoying flapping material,â said our tester.  There are four pockets too, for carrying snacks and valuables on your rides.  Cycling glasses  Protect your eyes from the elements, whether thatâs blinding sunlight, lashing hailstones, insects or road debris with a pair of glasses.  They can also make it easier to see the road in low light. In our guide to best, these Smith Optics attack (Smith Optics, Â£190) were head and shoulders above the rest.  The magnetic arms mean you can swap between lenses by just tilting the end of the arm and then snap it out of position to remove it â then click it into your spare lens.  With no frame to get in the way, forward and peripheral vision were excellent, while a little cut out section at the brow helped airflow, so they didnât fog up. The megol nose and arm pads ensured they stayed firmly in place, even when our testers were sweating in hot weather.

This SFR essentials triple pad set (John Lewis & Partners, Â£15) comes in two sizes; small and medium and is designed for beginners at cycling, skateboarding or rollerblading.  Avoid bumps and bruises with protective padding ( John Lewis and Partners )  It contains knee pads and elbow and wrist guard with soft lining, impact caps and backing socks for maximum comfort and will cushion any nasty falls.  Bike light  While of course, bike lights are useful for visibility, itâs also against the law to ride at night without them, so itâs well worth investing in a set thatâs both bright and long-lasting.  Many modern styles are compact and easily portable and come with USB chargers for easy on-the-go top-ups.  Our highest-rated pair is this See.Sense icon 2 front and rear bike light set (See Sense, Â£149.99) which have every feature you could possibly need to stay safe on the road.  Each light weighs less than 60g each, but offer output of 400 lumens at the front and 300 at the rear and thereâs also a single, super-bright Cree light that grabs the attention from up to 3km away.  They stay securely fixed to your hike with a plastic mount and you can link them up with the app on your phone to unlock the theft warning and trigger alert features, and the battery provides up to 16 hours of use.  GPS  If you're confident on going on longer rides, use a GPS device to track them, set distance goals and record your pedalling rate, power output, or heartbeats.  Weâd recommend the Wahoo elemnt roam GPS bike computer (Evans, Â£299.99).  This GPS bike computer won't distract you from the road ahead  It highlights important bits on your route, such as major roads and rivers.  The screen is a hefty piece of glass which should stand up to the rough and tumble of off-roading.  Plus, you can set the LEDs on the left of the screen to show heart rate or power zones.  Bike locks  Once youâve arrived home if you donât have the storage space to bring your bike indoors or into a back garden, a good bike lock is a necessity.  The HipLok DX (Tredz, Â£63.99) was the winner in our review of bike locks which easily fits into a pocket or onto a belt loop for safekeeping.  Keep your hardware soft with a reliable bike lock, like this one, which is big enough to go through your frame or a wheel  Itâs Sold Secure gold-rated and the lock is protected from the weather by a rubber seal. You get three nicely-sized, tactile keys which are easy to use, even with gloves on. And if you ever lose them you can get replacements using a unique code.

University of Cambridge experts suggest current portrayals and stereotypes about AI risk creating a âracially homogenousâ workforce of aspiring technologists, creating machines with bias baked into their algorithms.  The scientists say cultural depictions of AI as white need to be challenged, as they do not offer a âpost-racialâ future but rather one from which people of colour are simply erased.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  According to the researchers from Cambridge's Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (CFI), like other science fiction tropes, AI has always reflected racial thinking in society.  In the study published in the Philosophy and Technology journal, they argue there is a long tradition of racial stereotypes when it comes to extraterrestrials â from the âorientalisedâ alien of Ming the Merciless to the Caribbean caricature of Jar Jar Binks.  However, AI is portrayed as white because unlike species from other planets, it has attributes used to âjustify colonialism and segregationâ in the past, the researchers suggest.  Dr Kanta Dihal, who leads CFI's Decolonising AI initiative, said: âGiven that society has, for centuries, promoted the association of intelligence with white Europeans, it is to be expected that when this culture is asked to imagine an intelligent machine, it imagines a white machine.  âPeople trust AI to make decisions. Cultural depictions foster the idea that AI is less fallible than humans.  âIn cases where these systems are racialised as white, that could have dangerous consequences for humans that are not.â  The experts looked at recent research from a range of fields, including Human-Computer Interaction and Critical Race Theory, to demonstrate that machines can be racialised, and that this perpetuates âreal worldâ racial biases.

Dr Dihal said: âOne of the most common interactions with AI technology is through virtual assistants in devices such as smartphones, which talk in standard white middle-class English.  âIdeas of adding black dialects have been dismissed as too controversial or outside the target market.â  The researchers conducted their own investigation into search engines, and found that all non-abstract results for AI had either Caucasian features or were the colour white.  Co-author of the paper, Dr Stephen Cave, executive director of CFI, said: âStock imagery for AI distils the visualisations of intelligent machines in western popular culture as it has developed over decades.  âFrom Terminator to Blade Runner, Metropolis to Ex Machina, all are played by white actors or are visibly white onscreen.  âAndroids of metal or plastic are given white features, such as in I, Robot.  âEven disembodied AI â from HAL-9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey to Samantha in Her â have white voices.  âOnly very recently have a few TV shows, such as Westworld, used AI characters with a mix of skin tones.â  Dr Dihal added: âAI is often depicted as outsmarting and surpassing humanity.  âWhite culture can't imagine being taken over by superior beings resembling races it has historically framed as inferior.  âImages of AI are not generic representations of human â like machines â their whiteness is a proxy for their status and potential.â  Dr Dihal concluded: âThe perceived whiteness of AI will make it more difficult for people of colour to advance in the field.  âIf the developer demographic does not diversify, AI stands to exacerbate racial inequality.â  PA",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/ai-bias-whiteness-racial-inequality-researchers-a9656546.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,73f1057b453014d328356cebc97dd57ed754e39e60af7ebb26a45099fd9816f6,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Pubs, restaurants and cafes closed at 5pm on Wednesday and a five-mile travel rule has been put in place.

Scotlandâs first minister Nicola Sturgeon said 54 new cases have emerged in the outbreak âthat may include some community transmissionâ.  Speaking at a Covid-19 briefing in Edinburgh, she said 191 contacts have been traced in relation to the cluster and more than 20 pubs and restaurants are involved.  Ms Sturgeon said the decision to reimpose some measures was taken to âprevent further spread and to give the test and protect teams the best possible chance of successfully breaking these chains of transmissionâ.  She added: âThe last thing we want to do is to reimpose these restrictions but this outbreak is reminding us just how highly infectious Covid is.  âOur precautionary and careful judgement is that we need to take decisive action now, difficult as that undoubtedly is, in order to try to contain this outbreak and prevent further harm later on.â  The measures, which apply to the Aberdeen City area, will be backed by government regulations, the first minister said, and will be enforced if the rules are not followed.  The Scottish government later announced that visits to hospital and care homes from a named family member or friend will be stopped, with only essential visits being allowed.  The decision was taken following a meeting of the Scottish Government Resilience Committee (SCOR), which also included leaders of Aberdeen City Council, NHS Grampian and Police Scotland.

The first minister said people should not travel to Aberdeen, but those who are already there can remain.  Ms Sturgeon said the restrictions will be reviewed next Wednesday, when she hopes they could be removed, either in entirety or in part.  However, the first minister said they could be extended beyond that seven-day period if necessary.  And she hinted measures could be enforced to stop people going on pub crawls amid fears they spread infections.  Ms Sturgeon said: âIt could be that what we see here is a pattern which involves people going from one pub to another in the same night.  âNow it may be that we have to look at some of those lessons to think about whether we need to tighten up some of the restrictions about how hospitality is operating across the wider country.â  NHS Grampian has named 28 bars and restaurants, three golf clubs and a football club as venues visited by people linked to the cluster.  Jenny Laing, co-leader of Aberdeen City Council said: âIt is unfortunate that just as we were returning to normality that this has happened, but the safety of our citizens is our first priority.  âWe must adhere to the Scottish Governmentâs guidance to ensure the safety of everyone.â  Across Scotland, 18,781 people have tested positive for the virus, up by 64 from the day before.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/aberdeen-lockdown-pubs-restaurants-close-nicola-sturgeon-scotland-a9655121.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,f94478c7814bf4f42efc0099571cf599b425b0c62583f96894beb31df665f8f0,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

To support us, please consider a contribution.  This month marks the 75th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, when humanity learned of the devastation a single nuclear bomb can unleash. The lingering suffering caused to the survivors, the hibakusha, should give us daily motivation to eliminate all nuclear arms. The survivors have shared their stories so the horror experienced by Hiroshima and Nagasaki will never be forgotten. Yet the nuclear threat is growing once more.  A web of agreements and instruments has been constructed to prevent the use of these uniquely destructive weapons and ultimately to eliminate them. But that framework has idled for decades and is starting to erode. The potential that nuclear weapons will be used â intentionally, accidentally or as a result of miscalculation â is dangerously high.  Fuelled by mounting international tensions and the dissolution of trust, relations between countries that possess nuclear weapons are devolving into dangerous and destabilising confrontations. As governments lean heavily on nuclear weapons for security, politicians are trading heated rhetoric about their possible use and devoting vast sums of money to improving their lethality, money that would be much better spent on peaceful, sustainable development.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  For decades, nuclear testing led to horrific human and environmental consequences. This relic of a former age should be confined there forever. Only a legally-binding, verifiable prohibition on all nuclear testing can achieve this. The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has proven its worth, yet some states have still to sign or ratify the treaty, preventing it from fulfilling its full potential as an essential element in the framework to eliminate nuclear weapons.  Along with climate change, nuclear weapons represent an existential threat to our societies. Most of the roughly 13,000 nuclear arms currently in global arsenals are vastly more destructive than the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Any use would precipitate a humanitarian disaster of unimaginable proportions.  It is time to return to the shared understanding that a nuclear war cannot be won and must not be fought. We need to return to the collective agreement that we should work towards a world free of nuclear weapons, and to the spirit of cooperation that enabled historic progress towards their elimination.  The US and the Russian Federation, as the possessors of some 90 per cent of nuclear weapons, are expected to lead the way. The New Start (strategic arms reduction) treaty retains verifiable caps on weapons. Its extension for five years would buy time to negotiate new agreements, including by potentially bringing in other countries possessing nuclear weapons.  Next year, the United Nations (UN) will host the Review Conference of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), one of the most successful international security agreements. It contains the only treaty-based commitments undertaken by the five largest nuclear-armed countries to pursue the elimination of nuclear weapons and imposes verifiable obligations not to acquire or develop nuclear weapons. Its near universal membership means the vast majority of the international community is bound by these commitments. The conference where we review the NPT is an opportunity to stem the erosion of the international nuclear order.  Fortunately, most UN member states remain committed to the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. This is reflected in the 122 countries that supported the adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. They understand that the consequences of any use of nuclear arms would be catastrophic. We cannot risk another Hiroshima or Nagasaki, or worse. As we reflect on the suffering of the hibakusha, let us view this tragedy as a rallying cry for humanity and recommit to a world free of nuclear weapons.

2020-08-06 13:20:24.886079,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 07:10:00 GMT",Escape to the country: Will people leave cities behind post-pandemic?,"The Independent employs reporters around the world to bring you truly independent journalism. To support us, please consider a contribution.  For centuries, cities have been plagued by periodic crises. The Great Plague of 1665 killed 70,000 Londoners, and those who could afford to leave fled the city. King Charles II and his courtiers left for Hampton Court. Parliament was moved to Oxford. All trade between London and other plague towns was stopped. The border with Scotland was closed.  Across the channel was no different: in 1641 the future King Louis XIV of France was sent from Paris to Versaille to escape a smallpox epidemic. Centuries later, George IV â whose health was declining â was advised by physicians to escape the English capital and live in Brighton, so he could benefit from the sea air (something the upper classes would later begin to do en-masse).  Even in modern times, parts of society have always planned an escape for when city life becomes perilous: both 9/11 and the July 2005 London bombings saw a spike in interest in rural properties, according to Rupert Sweeting, head of national sales at Knight Frank estate agents.  Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  But these shifts were always, largely, temporary. The opportunities for employment, wealth and education that urban areas offered meant that, like Dick Whittington, each generation of youth continued to be tempted by streets âpaved with goldâ. But what about in a post-Covid world; will technology, and the ability for many to work remotely â on 9 July Matt Hancock said he would consider making it mandatory for employers to give the option of remote working - mean the exodus is final?  Coronavirus is a virus defined by city living. It originated in Wuhan, China, a city of 11 million people. Deaths in cities have not been universally higher than in less-populated areas (poverty has played a more crucial role than density) but the statistics indicate cities are hard hit: the most recent Public Health England data [for week beginning 8 July] shows the highest number of deaths is in London (6,715) followed by the north west (6,589) and the south east (5,247).  Other difficulties of city living have been thrown into the spotlight in lockdown: trapped in properties that are, on average, smaller than elsewhere; having less access to a garden (21 per cent of Londoners have no garden); the inflated rental prices (London is highest in Europe, Manchester is 30th and Birmingham 36th); and the density of people making social distancing harder. As the proximity to your office becomes negligible, and no one is able to take advantage of cultural and gastronomic benefits, the pros of urban jungle life are less obvious.  I think Covid has given more people the impetus to leave because it has highlighted the severe inequalities that [always] existed...  Peter deGraft-Johnson, 26, is one of those thinking about leaving London after lockdown. The poet and part-time cinema worker, who first moved to east London from Essex for university in 2014, was part of the high-risk shielding group, so has spent three months in self-isolation. DeGraft-Johnson says what initially attracted him to the city was âto be a part of the progressive arts and culture communitiesâ and to meet like-minded people.  Despite great memories of the city, like hosting a sold-out poetry showcase at the Southbank Centre in January 2020, he is now considering moving back to Essex, or even abroad. âI think many young people are considering leaving,â he tells The Independent. âI think Covid has given more people the impetus to leave because it has highlighted the severe inequalities that [always] existed. Racist policing, high cost of living, lack of affordable and safe housing.â  Grace Paul, 28, a freelance book editor, who also lived in London for six years, has already made the move back to her parentâs house in Kent after her houseshare tenancy ended. She doesnât see herself returning to the capital post-pandemic. âIâve grown so much as a person in the city and Iâll always be grateful for that,â she says. â[But] I want to buy a property but am unable to do so in London. Now I am remote working so I donât need to be in the city.â  Shape Created with Sketch.

âreassessâ what she wants from life. Now she plans to save up, and start looking for a home in Margate or Bristol in 2021. Lucy Moss, 39, from Manchester, and her husband Sasha, also say they have found lockdown made them more reflective about what they want for their family â and it isnât city living. âWe had not really been forced to think about it before lockdown â the city kept us busy. But now nothing is here, we realise how much we want to be closer to family and friends.â  Of course migrating to the suburbs is not unique to the Covid-era: Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show 340,500 people left London in the 12 months up to June 2018, and 336,000 the year before (the largest numbers since 2012). Anthony Champion, professor of population geography at Newcastle University cites the âregional escalatorâ model, which shows: âYoung people are most likely to move in from the shires to achieve more rapid career progress than they felt they would at home, and then later in their lives cash in on their inflated urban house values and move out, either at family building age [before children] or nearer retirement.â  But limited early data post-lockdown suggests we aren't seeing just the normal cycle of movement. The number of jobseekers wanting to get out of the capital has more than doubled in the last fortnight compared with the same period in 2019, according to careers advisory service, Escape the City. Of 1,000 people who signed up, 51 per cent wanted out of the capital compared to 20 per cent last year. A YouGov poll, conducted exclusively with The Independent, found many people, at a range of ages and stages in life (some homeowners, other renters), were considering moving further afield because of remote working.  The proportion of buyers with London postcodes registering with estate agencies outside of the capital almost doubled in April. Birmingham and Manchester buyers also showed increasing interest in rural house hunting, according to figures from Hamptons estate agency. With the most popular destinations being Worthing in Sussex, Ipswich in Suffolk and Milton Keynes. According to a May survey by estate agents Savills, four in 10 would now find a village location more appealing than before, with 71 per cent of younger buyers craving more outdoor space.  But this isnât just about house buying. Even for people who own homes in cities, like 33-year-old Julia Nicholls from Canary Wharf, the pandemic has given her a change in mindset. âAs a kid I always dreamed of moving out of my small town. I fell in love with London aged seven, on school trips I always loved the transfer from Euston to London Bridge, I loved the smell of the underground on a warm day (I still do), the bright lights and bustle.â  Theyâre seeing how much it costs to live here and reassessing whether itâs still worth it...  But lockdown has made her reassess her priorities, and she now wants to move to Brighton. âLots of my friends are having similar thoughts to me. Especially those in their thirties. Theyâre seeing how much it costs to live here and reassessing whether itâs still worth it.â For Nicholls being able to work remotely makes this dream a possibility â several big UK-based employers have already publicly announced they are changing office setups: Twitter says employees can âwork from home foreverâ and 13 per cent of London businesses polled for the London Chamber of Commerce said working from home would become standard practice.  Of course for many frontline or low wage workers, the option to work in a city 100 miles away from their employer is not on the table. But for those for whom it is â could it change everything? Champion says: âThere have been suggestions that new technology could free up people to live further from their workplaces and Covid-19 has caused a lot more home working than usual. Post-pandemic, it is possible that more people will work from home. This could indeed fuel a spike in suburbanization and counter-urbanization.â  Kevin Ward, professor of human geography at University of Manchester, agrees this could finally be the technology-enabled future weâve been imagining for decades. âIn the 1970s there was a sense that technology would allow us to work less and work flexibly, including working from home but it never really delivered,â he says, but going forward it is likely to be âgeographically and socially unevenâ in its application, as some can afford to get out of the city while others cannot.  And Champion warns this mass movement will be made much harder for many if there is a recession, which is already widely forecast to be as bad, if not worse, than after the 2008 financial crash. âIf there is a severe recession coming along, it looks like it is affecting cities more than elsewhere so residents may be trapped by house price dips there,â he says.  Whether the post-Covid migration ends up being another urban pipe dream (one you entertain after a few glasses of wine, but never sober), or just the continuation of an age-old cycle (young people move in, older people move out), we have collectively witnessed the shortcomings of cities in a time of crisis. And with greater accessibility to remote working, a door has been opened, showing us the future doesnât have to look the same as the past.",https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/people-leaving-cities-london-manchester-coronavirus-pandemic-lockdown-a9612116.html,http://www.independent.co.uk/rss,5f8f07332adac8ea3de61c4287383008079defb8c8b279572300c99db096c0b0,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

She died just a day after learning the CPS was going ahead with her trial on a charge of assault by beating stemming from an alleged bust-up with boyfriend Lewis Burton in December 2019.  An inquest into her death resumed at Poplar Coronerâs Court in London this morning for a second day before Senior Coroner Mary Hassell, and today the issues surrounding the assault case were examined.  The court previously heard the CPS initially rejected a prosecution in the case, but the police appealed the decision and it eventually moved forward and Caroline was charged with assault by beating.  Today the inquest heard that CPS prosecutor Alison Wright did not believe charging Flack was in the public interest.  (Image: Getty Images)  Sections of her summary were read in court. It said: ""Flack states that she is going to kill herself as a result of Burton's alleged cheating.  ""She has repeatedly admitted she assaulted him.  ""I do not believe that the case is in the public interest to prosecute as the injured party does not support the allegation, there is no domestic violence history, the suspect is 40 with no previous convictions.  ""There is nothing so serious about this incident which means the guidelines (to issue a caution) need to be diverted from.""  If the police had not appealed the decision, Caroline would have been handed a caution - which would have given her a criminal record but would have kept the case out of court.  (Image: WAYNE BUCKLAND / MATRIXPICTURES.CO.UK)  During today's inquest, Detective Inspector Lauren Bateman gave evidence and defended the decision to appeal the CPS' initial decision.  She told the court: ""I felt in these circumstances it was not a minor offence. Mr Burton was asleep at the time. It was an unprovoked attack while he was defenceless.""  DI Bateman also told the court that giving a caution depending on an admission of guilty from a suspect and she said she was not satisfied that that was a full enough admission for a caution.  When asked by the coroner if she would have done anything differently, DI Bateman replied: ""No, absolutely not.''  Lisa Ramsarran, deputy chief Crown prosecutor, previously told the inquest: ""There were some aggravating features of the offence. Mr Burton was asleep at the time he was struck, therefore he was not necessarily in a position to know what it was he was struck with.  ""But it was sufficient to cause a significant injury so it was not necessarily relevant what the object was.""  (Image: carolineflack/Instagram)  The inquest heard prosecutor Kate Weiss reviewed the decision to charge Caroline a week after the assault.  She cited various factors â such as the violence involved, that Lewis Burton was sleeping, that a caution is rare for a domestic violence case, and that police said Flack showed no remorse in interview â when making her decision that a caution was not appropriate.  She said: âIn light of these factors, I believe a caution is not appropriate.â  She also said Caroline demonstrated a âlack of remorseâ by breaching her bail condition not to contact Lewis when she sent an Instagram message to him saying: âI love you.â  Over the two months, a total of six reviews of the case were carried out and a final decision to proceed with the charges was made on February 13.

Defender Kelly was closely monitored by Liverpool last summer as he prepared to leave Bristol City, but he chose to join the Cherries for Â£13million due to the offer of more first-team football.  The 21-year-old ultimately suffered an injury-hit campaign at the Vitality Stadium, but he was able to come into the side after the Premier League's coronavirus lockdown.  He made his top-flight debut in the defeat at Wolves on June 24, and played eight times as he was unable to save his side from relegation, which eventually led to manager Eddie Howe leaving the club by mutual consent.  (Image: Will Oliver/NMC/Pool/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)  Liverpool's recent transfer history shows that they are not afraid to try again for a player even if they miss out on him at the first time of asking, and so Bournemouth's relegation led to some suggestions that they could move to try and sign Kelly again this summer.  But, according to The Athletic, Edwards has no interest in doing that due to the way the potential deal was handled last year.  (Image: Getty Images)  Kelly was of interest to Liverpool due to his ability to play at both left-back and centre-back, but the Norwich left-back Jamal Lewis has now emerged as their top target as cover for Andy Robertson.  The 22-year-old shares some of the Scot's attacking instincts, and is said to be ""desperate"" to link up with Jurgen Klopp's Premier League champions.

Publishing its review into high cost credit, the Financial Conduct Authority found example after example of lenders making money from people already in debt, while advertising additional loans for things like holidays.  One man from Glasgow told them: ""I was borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, and robbing Paul to pay someone else.""  And the cost to real people is higher than just the interest rate.  A woman from Peterborough said: ""Itâs a feeling of helplessness. Itâs awful. You donât sleep, you worry. You feel guilty about not being in a better position to support your family and about having made poor decisions in your life.""  The FCA found some 48% of customers had to cut back on other spending to make their loan repayments, with 37% missing essential payments such as rent, mortgage, utility bills or council tax in the past 6 months alone.  More than two people in five (45%) regretted taking out additional loans.  The FCA's Jonathan Davidson said: ""We have significant concerns that repeat borrowing could be a strong indicator of levels of debt that are harmful to the customer.  ""Before the pandemic we saw increasing numbers of complaints about high-cost lenders' re-lending practices, which showed that firms had failed to adequately assess affordability, and they were not re-lending in a way that was sustainable for customers.""  He added: ""We will continue working with firms to raise standards, and we will continue to take action where we see harm.""  (Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)  The FCA found that banks make significantly more money from these additional loans.  Many firms, particularly those offering small value loans, do not make a profit on a customer's first loan, the FCA said.  For nearly all firms, profitability increases for subsequent loans, in many cases substantially, according to the regulator.  And the marketing to consumers frequently pushes these new loans.  A man from Sheffield told the regulator: ""When I started, I would take Â£100 at the beginning of the month and another Â£100 later in the month.  ""Then I started taking out Â£500 at the beginning of the month. Then I began to take out loans to pay my other loans, and just to get by.""  But the messaging around new loans from firms focuses on how easy it is to get them, and rarely the risks.  It also uses psychological pushes to encourage people to take more loans out and encouraging people to borrow as much as possible.  The FCA said this needs to stop.  ""We expect firms to take action to ensure marketing material is more balanced,"" the review said.  Davidson said: ""We are closely engaged with firms to understand the impacts of the pandemic on consumers.  ""Where consumers are experiencing payment difficulties, we encourage them to contact their credit provider as soon as possible and explain their situation and get the help that lenders have agreed to provide.""",https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/crackdown-expensive-loans-customers-borrowing-22479180,https://www.mirror.co.uk/?service=rss,0ad0a06c863a986c172f787c9ac7445c2854e48b59bb6b4827e078cbccbd6809,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

So you can imagine our excitement when we found out that Primark was launching a haircare line with the Kardashians' very own hair stylist, Andrew Fitzsimons, back in March.  And now they have collaborated again to release a brand new collection of heated styling tools at affordable prices.  The Primark x AF range includes a high performance hairdryer with an extra long cord, straighteners and a hair curling wand - and it looks amazing.  The best part? Each item costs only Â£12, which is pretty cheap in comparison to stylers from leading hair brands like BaByliss and ghd.  Speaking about his latest collaboration with Primark, Fitzsimmons said: ""People often ask me how they can create the looks I deliver for my clients at an affordable price point. Now, Iâve created a haircare range that will do just that.""  He went on to say: ""Itâs a dream come true to launch my own hair care range. To know I am doing it with a retailer so suited to my vision and so close to my Dublin roots makes it all the more special.""  The hair stylist has a huge list of A-list clients including the Kardashian and Jenner clan as well as Bella Hadid, Ashley Graham and Joan Smalls.  Keen to get the Kardashian look for less? Us too!

""Hot or very hot conditions are likely across southern, central, and eastern parts of England from Friday as warm air spreads north from France.  ""These conditions are likely to persist into the weekend, perhaps being eroded from the northwest by less hot and cloudier conditions for a time, with the slight relieving conditions currently probably reaching a southern limit over central parts of England.

What is a Level 3 heat alert?  This is triggered when the Met Office confirms threshold temperatures for one of more regions have been reached for one day and the following night, and the forecast for the next day has a greater than 90% confidence level that the day threshold temperature will be met.  This stage requires social and healthcare services to target specific actions at high-risk groups.

It had also traded under the names Mountainweekends.com Skiweekends.com, SkiWeeks.co.uk, snow-academy.com and international-academy.com.  Ski Weekends offered travel from 17 airports across to the UK and arranged holidays to ski resorts across Europe.  But the company was devastated by coronavirus - with PlanetSKI reporting that it was unable to raise the money to refund all customers after resorts were forced to close in mid-March.  (Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)  Dan Fox, managing director of Ski Weekends, told PlanetSKI : âWe have been failed by all the government schemes and a business that was a going concern in its format has now gone.  âI have tried everything in my power to keep the business going, but have been unable to.  âOn a personal level I have lost much money and it has been devastating.  âIt has been a nightmare for the past four months to be honest.  âOur clients and our staff are like family to us.â  But Mr Fox said he had bought the name 'Ski Weekends' and plans to continue using it.  The firm is set to offer accommodation-only packages.  Now the Civil Aviation Authority has urged travel agents to hold on to money for bookings with the ski specialist.  The CAA warned: âIf you are a travel agent of Harris Holidays Ltd and you are currently holding consumer payments which you have not yet paid to Harris Holidays Ltd, you are advised not to refund consumers with these funds until you have received instructions from the Air Travel Trust.  âTravel agents will be individually contacted by the CAA with specific instructions for these bookings.â  An Association of British Travel Agents spokesman said: âThe companyâs Administrator will be writing to all customers within the next few days with instructions on how to claim a full refund and provide contact details for customer enquiries.

The World Travel & Tourism Council issued the dire warning as travel restrictions continue to cause huge problems for the sector.  The research shows that if some travel restrictions -including quarantine measures and blanket travel bans were removed sooner, it could save a staggering 1.3m jobs.  Gloria Guevara, WTTC President & CEO, said: âOur new modelling reveals the depth of the long-term crisis facing the UK Travel & Tourism industry if travel restrictions, such as the 14-day quarantine measures introduced by Government this week and the FCO travel advisory continue for some time.  âUnder our worst-case scenario, prolonged travel restrictions could put nearly three million jobs under threat and cause a loss of more than $180 billion to Travel & Tourism GDP in the UK.    âThe sectorâs recovery risks being undermined by heavy-handed restrictions just as it emerges from one of the most punishing periods in its history â and itâs not just airlines who will bear the cost but the entire travel ecosystem.    âHotels, destinations and travel agents will all suffer from the economic domino effect of prolonged restrictions on movement, plunging millions of travel businesses and their employees into financial ruin.â",https://www.mirror.co.uk/travel/news/harris-holidays-ceases-trading-new-22478970,https://www.mirror.co.uk/?service=rss,a8cf582bbc5fb9d0a3b27e4cf015cf7da81c0dcca9077720b378da9d80bc6635,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Rupert Soames, chief executive of Serco, which is among several firms that are recruiting, coaching and managing contact tracers, admitted that the Test and Trace system has ""more capacity than we need"" but said the Government ""had to start somewhere"".  Mr Soames also admitted that 20% of contacts are untraceable as individuals who tested positive do not know them well enough to have their personal details.  His comments comes as an anonymous contact tracer said she is effectively being ""paid to watch Netflix "".  NHS England's Test and Trace system, which is being led by Baroness Dido Harding, relies on identifying people who have been in contact with a positive case and getting them to self-isolate.  (Image: Getty Images)  But the programme, run by Serco and Sitel through a contract reported to be worth up to Â£108 million, has faced questions about performance and value for money.  Official figures today showed thousands of England's coronavirus sufferers' recent contacts are failing to go into isolation after they were not reached by NHS Test and Trace.  Of Covid-19 patients who spoke to the ""world-beating"" system on July 23-29, 72.4% of their recent contacts were reached and told to self-isolate.  That figure has fallen two weeks in a row and is now at the second-lowest since NHS Test and Trace launched at the end of May.  The figures will spark fears some people could be unwittingly spreading the virus - which is at its most infectious at, or just before, the onset of symptoms.  And the news comes amid a worrying rise in cases.  Some 4,966 new people tested positive for Coronavirus (COIVD-19) in England in the most recent week - a rise of 17% on the week before. In the same period, testing rose by just 4%.  Restrictions were reimposed in Greater Manchester, Lancashire and West Yorkshire in the last week after local outbreaks. Preston could soon follow. And the ONS said last week that cases appear to be rising in England.  Last month, health expert Professor Sir Chris Ham wrote an opinion piece in the British Medical Journal urging the Government to give local leaders control over the service.  Mr Soames told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Test and Trace programme is ""improving all of the time"".  ""I think we need to get this into proportion. You're giving me the numbers saying that we're tracing 50% of contacts, let me tell you that 96% of the people that we talk to agree to self-isolate.  ""So we've got a very, very high success rate of people that we get to contact,"" he said.  Pushed on the fact that this is only the known contacts that tracers have been able to reach, Mr Soames added: ""So there's been 218,000 already contacted.""  Questioned again on why tracers are still only managing to get hold of half of people's contacts, Mr Soames said: ""If somebody rang you now and I said: 'Tell me everybody that you have met, been in contact with, in the last 48 hours, and tell me on the telephone, give me their contact details', how many do you think that you'd be able to reel off of the top of your head?  ""And the fact is that about 20% of the contacts that people give us say: 'I know I sat next to somebody on a bus on the way in but I don't have their contact details. I'm sorry, but my brother-in-law brought around a friend last night, I don't have their contact details.'  ""So there is an element of that, and it is about 20% at the moment where people can't remember or never knew the contact... the details of where they were.""  Asked why so many contact tracers are doing so little work, Mr Soames added: ""Let me tell you we've got 10 Nightingale hospitals lying vacant, we've got 30,000 ventilators that are not being used.  ""The Government has to start somewhere with capacity and the fact is that we've got too much capacity, or more capacity than we need right here, right now, today.  ""But naturally the Government has taken a decision to over-provide to begin with on the basis that we can always reduce it.  ""I mean we could increase the number of calls per agent by reducing the number of agents who are there and I am pretty sure that the Government, over the coming weeks, is going to start reducing the number that we have.""  A leaked email from Mr Soames in June disclosed that he wanted the system to ""cement the position of the private sector"" in the NHS supply chain.  In the email forwarded to staff, he said: ""If it (the contact tracing system) succeeds... it will go a long way in cementing the position of the private-sector companies in the public-sector supply chain. Some of the naysayers recognise this, which is why they will take every opportunity to undermine us.""

Today, Detective Inspector Lauren Bateman, of the Metropolitan Police, resumed giving evidence and the coroner allowed Caroline's mum Christine to ask her questions.

DI Bateman replied: ""It's difficult for me to answer that but she would have seen a doctor first"".

Perhaps in hindsight I could have gone and spoken to her but routinely I would not do"".  Christine the told DI Batement: ""I know the world and I have seen domestic abuse. I just think you should be disgusted with yourself.  ""I hope in hindsight you do regret this. That girl killed herself because you put an appeal through.  ""You never saw Caroline.

The blast sent shockwaves as far as the International Airport's passenger terminal, about 9km away.  Lebanon's President, Michel Aoun, has said the explosion was caused by the detonation of 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate that had been stored unsafely at a warehouse.  Many homes have been destroyed as a result, turning people's lives upside down.  But one grandmother was able to find a moment of peace amid the chaos, as she discovered her beloved piano had survived the blast.  The home May Abboud Melki had lived in for 60 years was left in shambles, with furniture strewn around, holes in the walls and glass and rubble all over the place.  According to her granddaughter, May-Lee Melki, the property had withstood plenty over the years, so it was heartbreaking to see it in such a state.  Speaking to CNN, she said: ""It survived the entire civil war... It witnessed bullets go through it.""  Thankfully neither of her grandparents had been home at the time of the explosion.  When May did return to her house though, she is said to have gone straight to the piano, which had been a gift from her father on her wedding day.  The 79-year-old sat down and began playing Auld Lang Syne.  A video of the emotional moment has since gone viral on social media, with Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon sharing it on Twitter.  She wrote: ""A song of connection and solidarity as our hearts go out to Beirut. If you can, support @RedCrossLebanon.""  After Auld Lang Syne, she moved on to playing Arabic hymns, which caused a crowd of volunteers to gather near the home and start worshipping.  May-Lee added: ""She pushed through the pain and tried to have a few moments of peace.  ""To see her lean into her faith, lean into God was something that was a strong message to her community and our family immediately.""

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will release a biography called ""Finding Freedom"" next week, which details the couple's departure from the royal family.  And no-one is said to be more upset about the shocking extracts than the Duchess of Cambridge, royal insider Lady Colin Campbell told new magazine .  Written by journalists Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, the explosive book takes aim at Prince William and his wife, labelling Wills a âsnobâ and implying Kate was frosty with Harryâs new girlfriend Meghan Markle.  (Image: Amazon)  Detailing how Wills gave a pep talk to his loved-up little brother, urging him, âDonât feel you need to rush this. Take as much time as you need to get to know this girl,â it claims, âIn those last two words, âthis girlâ, Harry heard the tone of the snobbishness that was anathema to his approach to the world.â  And now Lady C says the revelations have shaken the royal family, OK! reports.  âI am told everybody is extremely upset, that William is not a snob â he wouldâve said the same thing had she been the daughter of a duke,â she says. âBut since Harry has been with Meghan, theyâve sought every excuse to find a reason to be resentful of everybody and everything.â  (Image: Getty Images)  Royal expert Duncan Larcombe agrees, âWilliam and Kate will have lost a lot of sleep over this. You could argue itâs perfectly legitimate to take your brother aside and say, âDonât rush into anything,â but for that to be portrayed as him being a snob is a very extreme view. I know William will take that to heart massively.â  Itâs a far cry from the days when the two couples were dubbed the fab four, with Kate, Wills, Harry and Meghan snapped at polo matches and Kate and Meghan attending Wimbledon together. And thereâs no doubt Kate will be hurt by the comments â not only about Wills but the bookâs suggestion of her own frostiness.  One extract claims, âThe two duchessesâ relationship had struggled to move past the distant politeness of when they first met. Their cordial but distant rapport was apparent when the pair appeared alongside each other at the King Power Royal Charity Polo Day the previous summer.  (Image: FOX via Getty Images)  ""While the doting mothers were photographed next to each other with their children, the two appeared to barely exchange a word.â  Itâs no surprise these comments have enraged Lady C. âThey have definitely characterised and misrepresented William,â she says. âAnd Catherine is herself irrespective of who sheâs dealing with. This is a big sticking point with the Sussexes. Meghan requires everybody to fawn over her.â  âI think Kate will be desperately sad by the book,â adds Duncan. âIt does represent an enormous missed opportunity for Meghan. There was plenty of time for them to form a bond and be a support for each other in what is a very difficult role as a royal wife, but Harry and Meghan couldnât get away from Kensington Palace fast enough.â  (Image: PA)  The authors of Finding Freedom, which is being serialised ahead of its release on 11 August, say they spoke to more than 100 sources, including âclose friends of Harry and Meghanâs, royal aides and palace staffâ, who have given insight into the pairâs growing resentment towards the royal family.  It also charts the princesâ deteriorating relationship, claiming the couples were hardly speaking at a Commonwealth service in March.  An extract reads, âAlthough Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess barely acknowledged her,â while another argues it was Harry who drove the decision to quit the firm. âHarry felt very constrained. He wanted to be able to speak to his grandmother and his father but constantly found aides blocking his path.â  (Image: PA)  The book also alleges that, having complained of press intrusion since her marriage to Harry, Meghan actually tipped off the paparazzi while she was starring in Suits â although Lady C says, âI suspect more recently than that. Old habits die hard.â  She adds that Kate and Wills wonât be the only ones licking their wounds. âIâm told the whole family are very upset,â she says.  âMany believe that Harry and Meghan have said all these stories directly with the purpose of excusing her refusal to fit in with the royal family. And to give them the excuse to decamp to California and make a shedload of money.â  Duncan adds, âIt might be that the book will help clear the air. Itâd be nice to think they could bury the hatchet now, but I donât think many people think thatâs going to happen.â  With an ocean between them and the book about to hit the shelves, it seems a truce could be a long way off yet.  A spokesman for Meghan and Harry has said they âwere not interviewed and did not contribute toâ the book.

Get our daily email briefing straight to your inbox Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid Email  Tory minister Robert Jenrick has admitted he has ""no idea"" how much money property developers have donated to the Conservatives in the past year in a toe-curling interview.  The Housing Secretary was challenged on the number of donations to the party from property tycoons since Boris Johnson became Prime Minister, amid claims from Labour that his new planning overhaul was a ""developer's charter"".  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Well I've no idea because ministers are not involved in those issues, that is entirely for the Conservative Party.""  Presenter Nick Robinson said Â£11m had been donated since Mr Johnson entered No10 and asked how the public could trust the Tories when they were receiving so much cash from developers.  Mr Jenrick hit back, saying: ""You're entirely mischaracterising what we're doing here. We're actually asking developers to pay more.""  (Image: Getty Images)  He said the Government are ""saying we're going to abolish the current system which favours the big developers"".  In an awkward exchange, the senior Tory also admitted he regrets sitting next to developer Richard Desmond at a Tory fundraising dinner and sending him text messages afterwards.  Mr Jenrick came under sustained criticism when it emerged that he had met Mr Desmond at an event in November, where he was shown a video of the 1,500-home development at the former Westferry printworks in east London.  The Government later published documents relating to the development, which revealed that Mr Jenrick rushed through a decision on the project to prevent Mr Desmond's company from paying an estimated Â£40million in tax to the local council.  Just 12 days after the decision was made, Mr Desmond personally donated Â£12,000 to the Conservative Party.  Mr Jenrick was later forced to overturn his own decision due to ""apparent bias"".  Asked why people should trust him over the Government's new planning proposals, Mr Jenrick said: ""Well I don't think this does give more power to developers, it creates a much more certain system. It will, for example, fix the challenge of developer contributions once and for all.""  Pushed to explain what he learned from the experience of the Westferry development, Mr Jenrick added: ""I've set out the events around that decision and there are definitely lessons to be learnt.  ""I wish I hadn't been sat next to a developer at an event and I regret sharing text messages with him afterwards.  ""But I don't regret the decision, because I think it was right to get housing built on a brownfield site on a part of London that desperately needs it.

Public Health England (PHE) said there has been a surge in the use of bootlegged sedatives and anti-anxiety medications during the coronavirus lockdown.  3 Experts said the pills are usually blue and will stain your mouth Credit: Getty - Contributor  Officials claim that these have been linked to a string of deaths and warned that illicit drugs sold as benzodiazepines could have fatal consequences if taken with certain painkillers or alcohol.  On July 25 PHE put out the alert which stated that drugs were being marketed as anti-anxiety drugs such as alprazolam, diazepam and the sedative temazepam.  PHE said recent hospital admissions and deaths had been linked to the drugs through toxicology reports.  It advised users to watch out for a tablet with ""DAN 5620"" on one side and ""10"" on the other, as well as one marked ""T-20"", ""TEM 20"", ""Bensedin"" and ""MSJ"".  If you make something look legitimate people then either believe that it is or con themselves into believing that it is until they find out otherwise Harry Shapiro  The dangerous tablets are usually referred to as âstreet benzosâ, are blue and will usually stain your mouth.  People selling the drugs will often package them in blister packs or pharmacy packaging to make them look legitimate.  The drugs may not contain genuine medicines and could have non-medical substances and high-potency illicit benzodiazepines.  The strength of such street drugs can vary - putting the user at risk.  3 Experts said dealers will sometimes put the fake pills in blister packs Credit: Alamy  As the ingredients are also often unknown, people taking these pills have no measure of how they will affect them.  Benzodiazepines impact brain activity and slow the central nervous system, which affects breathing.  If used with other substances they can have a similar effect to drugs such as heroin.  PHE warned the drugs also impact mental health and can increase suicidal thoughts, particularly in young adults and people with alcohol or opioid addiction.  In April, the body advising the Government on drug use, called for three new synthetic benzodiazepines - flualprazolam, flunitrazolam and norfludiazepam - to be banned.  The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs found these so-called ""legal highs"" had been linked to 12 deaths in the UK as of March 2020.  3 Experts say the drugs may have been obtained on the dark web Credit: Getty - Contributor  Drug research and drug policy charity Release said it is still unclear where these bootlegged benzodiazepines are coming from, but that many are being supplied to dealers via the dark web.  The charity said that users are relying on face-to-face transactions to source the drugs.  Niamh Eastwood, Release's executive director said the surge during lockdown has been driven by those who would usually take heroin.  She added that people who would get their income from petty crimes had seen it disappear overnight.  ""One of the drivers of the increase in the early part of lockdown was that heroin users lost income and couldn't buy it so shifted to benzos which are significantly cheaper,"" she said.

The vote of the 20 clubs at their virtual summer meeting is understood to have demonstrated the divisions that exist.  1 Five subs were allowed for the Premier League's restart from the coronavirus shutdown Credit: Reuters  While the top half of the league backed Chelsea proposals to continue to allow five substitutes from a bench of nine, they fell well short of the required two thirds majority.  Instead, the opposition to the proposal, led by Aston Villa, was joined by the teams in the lower half of the table.  Indeed, a majority of the clubs voted against the five sub plan, with a 10-10 tie on the proposal to stick with the larger bench.  Of the promoted trio, Leeds are understood to have backed retaining a bench of nine but joined fellow new boys West Brom and Fulham in rejecting five replacements being allowed.  Under League rules, 14 votes must be in favour of any rule change for it to be adopted and the outcome shows how things have changed in the past two months.  When Chelsea initially proposed both rules - following Fifaâs lead - in June, they were both passed by 16 votes to four.  But Villa boss Dean Smithâs public comments and claims that having more options benefitted the Big Six in particular appears to have struck a chord with other clubs, including those who initially backed the proposals.

Weâve reviewed the Shark WV200UK and put it through its paces to see if itâs the real deal.  3 The Shark WV200UK has a neat storage solution Credit: SHARK  Shark WV200UK: Out the box  The Shark WV200UK is pretty simple and itâs easy to get your head around the gadget right out of the box.  Thereâs two attachments included with the vacuum: a crevice tool with an integrated dusting brush and a pet multi tool.  Plug in the charging station, place the Shark into the dock and youâre pretty much ready to go.  The attachments slot into the charging station for easy storage, so itâs easy to keep track of everything.  Shark WV200UK, Â£99.99 at Amazon - buy here  3 The Shark WV200UK is useful for cleaning up kitchen spills Credit: SHARK  Shark WV200UK: Performance  In our testing we were impressed with the power the Shark WV200UK provides.  For small spills and messes we think does a good job and with its attachments it can also be used on the stairs rather than lugging a full sized vacuum up and down.  The battery life is billed around eight minutes, but we didnât find it ran out that often, mostly because we only used it for small jobs.  Plus, when the Shark is in itâs stand, itâs on charge, so youâll always be attacking messes with a full battery.  The Shark is lightweight too: at 0.6kg itâs easy enough to wield with one hand and access difficult-to-access areas such as furniture, curtains, cobwebs on the ceiling and in the crevices of your carâs upholstery.  The dust compartment is on the smaller side at 0.25 litres, and while this is probably sufficient for day-to-day tasks, if youâre doing a deep clean of a dirty car, you might be better off with a cordless stick vacuum, such as the Shark IZ201UK.  After having it around the house for a while, we found ourselves using the Shark WV200UK for a variety of cleaning tasks, including crumbs in the kitchen, hard to reach areas in the living room (including skirting boards and under sofa cushions) and in the car.  Itâs especially good if youâre planning a Mrs Hinch-style cleaning job ahead of guests arriving.

Itâs a real time saver when cleaning up smaller messes, versus having to fetch your regular vacuum from the cupboard and find the correct attachment.  Plus itâll clean in areas a regular vacuum cleaner canât reach easily.  A mark against the Shark WV200UK is that there are plenty of cheaper handheld vacuum cleaners out there, but the Shark provides a good balance of performance and style.  If the price tag is a bit much for you, you could always wait until Black Friday and see if Shark put on a sale.

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to add the Aston Villa star to his burgeoning attacking ranks - even if it costs Â£80million.  7 Man Utd are confident in signing Jack Grealish this summer Credit: AP:Associated Press  7 Grealish's arrival could have repercussions for Fernandes and Pogba Credit: AFP or licensors  Villa, in turn, are set to offer their captain a bumper Â£100,000 a week deal in a bid to keep him at the club.  But it's looking more and more likely United land both Grealish AND Jadon Sancho this month, even if it means selling some deadwood to fund the near-Â£200m double swoop.  However, the arrival of the English pair will disrupt the status quo, with Solskjaer starting the same XI over and over again in the Premier League, to great effect, after the 2019-20 restart.  Grealish and Sancho arriving could mean Bruno Fernandes being shifted, with Paul Pogba and Mason Greenwood dropped to the bench.  We take a look at FIVE different ways Man Utd could line up if they sign Grealish and Sancho...  4-2-3-1  7 How Man Utd could line up with Grealish in their current formation  THIS is the tried-and-tested formation of late under Solskjaer - and it's clearly worked after Man Utd secured a top-four spot.  In this scenario, United would run their familiar back-four - with Dean Henderson almost certain to start ahead of blunder-prone David De Gea next season.  Henderson spent the season on loan at Sheffield United and has now demanded Solskjaer make him No1 or he'll quit to join Chelsea.  It's very possible Solskjaer looks to sell De Gea this summer, install Henderson as first-choice and keep Sergio Romero as his cup goalkeeper.  In midfield, Fernandes would take over Pogba's deeper role - with a defensive-minded partner a must.  Nemanja Matic performed well alongside Pogba, but looking to the future, Solskjaer is likely to start Scott McTominay.  That would allow Grealish to roam freely in his preferred No10 spot, with Sancho on the right.  Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial would complete the forward ranks, seamlessly interchanging between the left-wing and centre-forward positions.  Unfortunately, should Grealish and Sancho arrive, Mason Greenwood is likely to return to his bench role despite his phenomenal 2020.  4-3-3  7 How Man Utd would look if they started with a 4-3-3  A POPULAR choice in world football at present, Premier League champions Liverpool and former winners Manchester City favour the 4-3-3.  And it could perfectly for Man Utd in their potential new era.  In this instance, Pogba would replace one of Rashford or Martial in the starting XI.  Pogba and Fernandes would be afforded the freedom to push forward, with McTominay sitting deeper.  Grealish would shift to left wing - where he's spent most of the season at Aston Villa.  4-4-2  7 How Man Utd would look in a classic 4-4-2 with Grealish  IT'S certainly from the old school of English football, but 4-4-2 could be just the ticket for Man Utd.  The personnel is identical to that seen in the 4-2-3-1, but set up differently.  With the same back four, Fernandes and McTominay would sit in the central two spots.  The Portuguese star would be able to push forward when the opportunity arises, with McTominay staying back.  But the forward ranks look different here, with Grealish and Sancho on the flanks and Rashford and Martial both starting as the centre-forwards.  3-4-3/5-2-3  7 How Man Utd could look in a 3-4-3/5-2-3 formation  DESPITE all the attacking shuffling to worry about, Solskjaer could also debate mixing up his defence.  A back-three-cum-back-five is becoming increasingly popular these days.  And with Solskjaer recently full of praise for the returning Chris Smalling, the ex-England ace could join Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof in the central back-three.  Solskjaer explained: ""Chris has shown, over his career at Manchester United, how valuable he is for United.  ""This season was about him being a regular and going to Roma, showing and proving how good a centre-back he is.  ""I wanted to give [Maguire, Lindelof and Tuanzebe] a chance and so he found out that it was best for him to go to Roma to play for a year.  ""Now he's coming back. Chris has shown he will be valuable.  ""I've been speaking to him throughout and been delighted with his season.""  With three central defenders and two wing-backs - in Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Brandon Williams - Pogba and Fernandes would be allowed to play together, without the presence of a defensive-minded midfielder.  Sancho and Grealish would take up advanced wing roles in this formation with one of Rashford, Martial or Greenwood starting through the middle.  3-5-2  7 How Man Utd could look in a 3-5-2 formation  WITH the same back-three (or five) this formation sees a few tweaks further forward.  Should Solskjaer want to pack his midfield, an attacking trio of Grealish, Pogba and Fernandes could start in the middle.  They would be well protected by the wing-backs and back-three.  This formation would also allow for TWO central strikers, with Rashford and Martial the likeliest candidates.",https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/12328827/man-utd-grealish-transfer-five-formations-sancho/,https://www.thesun.co.uk/feed/,c58d8d487fa3c327981f673861c8575a4189bdb1320dcc1f9995b6c89a138bca,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The Northern Irishman, 31, reckons he and the rest of the gameâs big hitters have suffered because everyone has become so obsessed with trying to rein them in.  1 The Northern Irishman is trusting his driver to deliver him a fifth Major title Credit: EPA  But he has always rated the USPGA as his best chance of adding to his four Majors.  He has already won the title twice and said the Harding Park course in San Francisco offers him a great chance to end his six-year wait to add to his tally.  The world No 3 said: âIâve always liked how USPGA Championship set-ups have been for me. Theyâre fair.  âItâs not as if theyâve changed too much.  âYou look down a fairway at these championships and itâs the same width the whole way to the green.  âA lot of courses, they try to pinch it in at 320 and try to handcuff the longer hitters, whereas here the course just lets you play, which I like.  âLength is certainly an advantage here. Itâs a long golf course anyway.  âItâs playing even longer because of the conditions. The temperatures are barely going to get into the 60s.  âBut youâve got to drive it straight as well as long. Iâve had some pretty bad lies in the rough over the last few days.  âItâs not a guarantee that you can get to the green if you just wheel it around.  âYou still have to hit fairways. I think thereâs only one or two par fours where youâre not going to hit driver.  âMost of the time you are trying to get it down there as far as you can, which I think plays to one of my strengths.â  McIlroy is also encouraged by the fact he won seven straight matches to capture the World Match Play title the last time this course hosted a big event five years ago.  He said: âIf I remember anything about that week itâs that I played well when I needed to and hit good shots at the right times.  âYeah, itâs nice to have some good memories around a golf course that youâre playing a Major on. Itâs nice to be able to recall some of the shots youâve hit.  âHopefully some of that can help me this week â and can rekindle the sort of form that helped me win here.â  McIlroy tees it up with Tiger Woods and new world No 1 Justin Thomas at 4.33pm British time today.  And he insisted he is not getting too worked up about the fact that he has drawn a blank in the Majors since his victory in the 2014 USPGA at Valhalla.  He added: âIt doesnât keep me up at night and I donât think about it every day.  âBut when I play these Major championships, itâs something that Iâm obviously reminded of.

Josephine Conlon, 36, was stabbed seven times by Mark Brazant as she returned home from a bakery in Streatham, South London.  Josephine Conlon was attacked as she walked with her baby  10 Mark Brazant has admitted attempting to kill the mum  10 Josephine walks past her attacker in chilling CCTV  Brazant had only been released from jail six days before the attack for ambushing lone women.  But he was free to roam the streets despite his brutal history of violence after a blunder by supervisors.  Chilling footage released today shows the moment Josephine crossed paths with Brazant as she walked through Streatham with her baby.  The thug can then be seen lurking outside a shop as he smokes his cigarette - before he goes on to stalk Josephine.  Moments later, the paranoid schizophrenic pounced on Josephine.  Brazant, 44, today dramatically changed his plea and admitted attempted murder ahead of a potential retrial.  10 CCTV shows Josephine walking with her baby  10 Brazant can then be seen smoking  10 He then watches further down the road before following Josephine  On December 30, the thug armed himself with a knife and travelled on public transport hunting for a victim.  After laying in wait, he picked out his prey in Josephine and forcefully shoved her in the back before unleashing the terrifying knife attack.  She fell screaming into a driveway as the pram containing her baby daughter rolled on the kerb and became wedged next to a parked car.  Recalling the horror attack, Josephine said: ""I remember thinking he had pushed me into the driveway because he was going to rape me.  ""Then he didn't, he just started hitting me.  ""I realised I was being stabbed. I was screaming a lot because I was not in the road so I wanted somebody to hear me.  ""I was ducking and trying to get away and trying to get up on to my feet.  ""I could feel blood. The adrenaline took away pain but I could feel things dripping.""  JAIL RELEASE  Josephine was discovered covered in blood by a passerby, who had ran out when he heard her screams.  She was rushed to hospital where she was treated for seven stab wounds - including to her salivary gland - and still has scarring.  Brazant walked into Wandsworth Police Station two days later carrying a knife saying he had ""stabbed a person on the street two days earlier"".  He had disappeared following his release from Thameside jail on Christmas Eve where he was to spend a year on post-sentence supervision.  The fiend had been banged up for a string of horror attacks on lone women but despite his violent past, supervisors had failed to meet him at the prison gates.  Brazant had been due to live at a supported house for people with mental health problems but staff raised the alarm when he failed to show up.  This meant he was free to prowl alone without supervision despite his brutal past.  'THAT WILL DO'  Brazant carried out his first attack in 2017 when he hit a woman with a crutch at Lambeth North underground station.  And on November 26 last year, he attacked four women on the same day in a rampage of violence in the capital.  He grabbed one of his victims by the neck after accusing her of smiling at him and punched another for laughing.  After the attack on Josephine, Brazant tried claiming he was hearing voices telling him to hurt someone.  He said he chose the mum as a victim because she was small, female, pushing a buggy and he did not think she would fight back.  Having stabbed her repeatedly, he told himself ""that's enough, that will do"" and left, he said.  Brazant was on medication for his mental health condition but had stopped taking it.

The branches were already open for takeaway and delivery orders but now foodies can sit in branch when tucking into their meal.  â ï¸ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates  2 KFC has opened another 170 branches for dine-ins so customers can get 50 per cent off from next week Credit: Alamy  The fast food chain has signed up the to the government's eat out incentive - but it can only be applied when customers dine in on the premises.  By the end of the week, KFC hopes to have 750 branches open for customers to sit in so they'll be able to get half price food on Mondays through to Wednesdays throughout August.  Those opening this week include branches in Aberdeen, Gillingham, Hastings and Woolwich. You can find a full list of the reopened stores on KFC's website.  At the beginning of the week, when the scheme launched, only 580 of KFC's 900-plus UK restaurants were open for dine-ins.  How to calculate the bill THE government will pay for half of your bill, up to Â£10 a head, when you eat out on certain days of the week in August. To work out how much your bill will be after the discount is applied, you should start by adding together everything that you ordered. You'll then need to take off any items that it doesn't cover, such as alcoholic drinks and the service charge. Then, divide this by two to find out half of the bill. What if it comes to more than Â£10 per head? To check that it comes under the Â£10 per head cap, divide it again by the number of people who are dining. If it works out as more than this per person, then you'll need to multiply the number of people eating by Â£10. You should then minus the answer from the total cost of the items that the discount can be applied to. For example, four people eat out and the total bill that the discount can be applied to comes to Â£90. Half of the bill would be Â£45, but that's more than the limit. So you need to minus Â£40 (Â£10 per diner) from Â£90 to get the amount you will need to pay, which in this case is Â£50.  It lead to confusion among KFC customers who were left raging that their local branch appeared to be ""ignoring"" the offer.  Yesterday, the fast food giant finally released details of the deals customers can expect when the Eat Out to Help Out Scheme is running.  One of the cheapest items on the menu is two chicken wings, which would normally cost 99p but are reduced to 50p.  KFC's flagship boneless banquet has also been reduced to Â£3, down from Â£5.99.  2 KFC has finally shared its Eat Out to Help Out discounts  A popcorn chicken meal normally costs Â£4.29 but under the scheme will set you back just Â£2.15.  It's worth noting that many of KFC's restaurants across the UK are franchised, so prices may vary depending on the branch.  KFC diners will also need to ask for the discount to be applied when they're at the till.  The Eat Out to Help Out scheme covers up to Â£10 a head and can be used on top of other offers.  This means fans can bag a nine-piece bucket of fried chicken for just Â£3 when they stack two deals on a Tuesday in August.  You can stack deals at McDonald's too - here we reveal how you can get a Big Mac and fries for just a Â£1.

The River Otter in East Devon is already home to the 15 beaver families who were part of a five year study into their impact on the local environment.  5 The beavers will not be removed from the river Credit: PA:Press Association  They have been monitored by the Devon Wildlife Trust (DWT) and the government has now granted them permission to stay.  The Trust said this was ""the most ground-breaking government decision for England's wildlife for a generation.""  Beavers were first spotted in the river in 2008 but no one was sure of their origin or who was responsible for releasing them.  Some suspect wildlife activists illegally put them in the river.  5 The beavers mysteriously appeared in 2008 Credit: PA:Press Association  Beavers were originally hunted to extinction in the UK in the 16th century.  They were used for their meat, water resistant fur and a substance called castoreum.  Beavers secrete the yellowish fluid to mark territories but humans put castoreum in food, medicine and perfume.  5 Native beavers were hunted to extinction in England, Scotland and Wales Credit: PA:Press Association  When it was discovered the mysterious River Otter beavers had reproduced in 2014 the government planned to have them removed.  That's when the DWT stepped in and was given five years to study the beavers and find out if removal was necessary.  It's now been decided the beavers can have positive impacts for farmers and landowners.  The creatures create complex underwater homes they build out of wood.  These structures can work like natural flood defences and reduce the risk of flash flooding.  5  Beavers were also found to improve the water quality in the area and the amount of fish.  The trial showed the creatures had an overall positive impact on ecology.  All the evidence from the study helped the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to make what it called a ""pioneering"" decision.  Beavers can now live, roam and breed in the river.  They're the first extinct native mammal to get government backing to be reintroduced.  5 There's evidence to suggest beavers can help prevent flash floods Credit: PA:Press Association  Environment minister Rebecca Pow said: ""In our new system of environmental land management, those with land will be paid for delivering services, such as flood management and increased biodiversity.  ""Using beavers in a wider catchment sense, farmers could be paid to have them on their land.""  However, not everyone is happy that the 50 adult beavers and their young kits have government support.  Some people are concerned beaver dams can flood valuable land and protected fish species.  Mark Owen, Head of Freshwater at the Angling Trust, said: âThere remain serious concerns around the impact the release of beavers could have on protected migratory fish species, such as salmon and sea trout.  ""Many of these species have been lost from rivers such as the Otter.  ""We wrote to the Secretary of State about our concerns that the fish impacts studies for the River Otter were flawed.""  Beaver supporters think all the beavers need is the right management to have more positive impacts.  First ever video of a wild beaver in the UK  Beaver facts Here's what you need to know about the cute creatures... There are two species of beaver - the North American beaver and the Eurasian beaver. They're known for building huge underwater homes out of wood that are called dams. Beavers are the second largest rodent in the world. They secrete a goo-like substance called castoreum. It smells like vanilla and is sometimes used in human products, such as perfumes. Beavers are thought to be monogamous and a couple will live inside a dam with their offspring. They have orange front teeth that are extra-strong and help them bite through trees. UK hunters once hunted them to extinction in the 1700s.

It's a phenomenon that hasn't been seen anywhere else in the Solar System, as it's the first of its kind to be spotted at such low altitudes.  The research team, led by Japanese space agency Jaxa, think the gas wave may help solve mysteries surrounding Venus' mysterious greenhouse effect.  It was found in the region responsible for the effect, and may help experts understand how the planet's surface connects to its turbulent atmosphere.

Tyson and Holyfield have settled their differences since and are now good pals as they both embark on boxing comebacks.  According to Russia Today, Jones Jr's manager Zsolt Barna says he deems it necessary to insure against a âpossible extraordinary caseâ of Tyson chomping down an ear once again.  Barna ""is anticipating a repeat"" of Tyson's shameful actions all those years ago against Holyfield.  4 The referee unsurprisingly took one look at Holyfield's ear and waved off the fight Credit: Getty Images - Getty  But Jones Jr and Barna might have to be more wary of a KO than an ear-bite.  Tyson has insisted he is looking for a stoppage next month - even though it's against the rules.  It is an eight-round exhibition bout that will take place in California.  Both of the fighters have been told not to go for a knockout win - but Tyson has other ideas.  When asked if he will be hunting for a KO, Tyson told TMZ: ""If the opportunity comes, I'm always looking for it.""

The 40-year-old's mum, Chris, shook her head as DI Lauren Bateman said she wouldn't do anything differently, after pushing to charge the Love Island presenter.  6 Caroline Flack's mum quizzed an officer who applied to charge her daughter today Credit: Rex Features  6 Caroline was found dead in February after learning a court case against her was going ahead Credit: PA:Press Association  Her mum said her daughter killed herself after cops pushed for a ""show trial"" and charged her with allegedly attacking boyfriend Lewis Burton.  In an emotional outburst at the inquest today, she told the officer: ""I see domestic abuse and I just think you should be disgusted with yourself.  ""There is nothing we can do to bring Caroline back. I hope in hindsight you do regret this.  ""This girl killed herself because you put an appeal through.""  She added: ""I feel even more upset now than I did at the start. I'm not legal, but I have been reading up on this.  ""I will never get Caroline back but she was not an abuser.""  The heartbroken mum relived Caroline's troubled few days before her arrest and blasted cops, saying her daughter was in ""no fit state"" to have been quizzed and arrested.  When she finished, the coroner asked if the Met Detective would like to reply, with DI Bateman laughing and saying: ""There was quite a lot said.  ""Is there anything specific you'd like me to respond to? Was that a question, or...""  I feel even more upset now than I did at the start. Chris Flack  It comes after a report from CPS prosecutor Alison Wright, read at the inquest today, said police pushed to charge Caroline over the allegations.  She said officers claimed she took ""a biased view of the case because Caroline Flack is a celebrity"", after she initially wanted to issue a caution and they refused.  Coroner Mary Hassell told DI Bateman, who applied for a formal charge: ""(Her) family feel that she was being taught a lesson in a way that a non-celebrity would not have been - that this was motivated by treating a celebrity in a way that a non-celebrity would not have been treated.""  DI Bateman insisted: ""I would have done exactly the same if it had been anyone.""  Caroline was pronounced dead on February 15, the day after she had learned the CPS was pursuing charges that she allegedly attacked her boyfriend Lewis Burton, 27.  The TV star was said to be tormented by the thought of facing court in what her family slammed as a âshow trialâ.  The inquest was told this morning she wrote a note before she died, which read: ""Please let this court case be dropped and myself and Lewis find harmony.""  Her twin sister Jody confirmed ""that looks exactly like Caroline's handwriting"".  'SHOW TRIAL'  Today, her family and legal representatives were part of a virtually held inquest into her death, with only a coroner and press physically present in court.  A police incident report was read out to the coroner - stating Lewis had told cops he was woken up after being hit on the head.  Caroline had told police she had hit him to try and wake him, after finding out he had been cheating on her.  She told officers: ""I had his phone in one hand, and my phone in the other. I whacked him round the head - there's no excuse for it, I was upset.""  Yesterday Caroline's tearful mum blasted the CPS for her daughter's ""show trial"" at the Love Island star's inquest.  Chris, who also watched proceedings at Poplar Coroner's Court yesterday via videolink, wiped away tears as her statement was read out.  It said: ""I believe Caroline was seriously let down by the authorities and in particular the CPS for pursuing the case. I believe this was a show trial.  ""Being well known should not allow special treatment, but should not allow making an example of someone.""  YOU'RE NOT ALONE EVERY 90 minutes in the UK a life is lost to suicide. It doesn't discriminate, touching the lives of people in every corner of society - from the homeless and unemployed to builders and doctors, reality stars and footballers. It's the biggest killer of people under the age of 35, more deadly than cancer and car crashes. And men are three times more likely to take their own life than women. Yet it's rarely spoken of, a taboo that threatens to continue its deadly rampage unless we all stop and take notice, now. That is why The Sun launched the You're Not Alone campaign. The aim is that by sharing practical advice, raising awareness and breaking down the barriers people face when talking about their mental health, we can all do our bit to help save lives. Let's all vow to ask for help when we need it, and listen out for others... You're Not Alone.

Her sister Jody said on Wednesday Caroline was ""in a very anxious state of mind"" before her death, adding in a statement an ambulance had been called for her four times previously.  In a statement read to the court Caroline's boyfriend, Lewis, told of her worries about the case and not being able to see him.  He said: ""The last time [I] saw Caroline she was very upset, in fact devastated, she was not in a good place emotionally.""  An ambulance had been called to Caroline's house the night before she died due to pals' concerns for her - but she told paramedics she didn't want to go to hospital.  'NOT IN A GOOD PLACE EMOTIONALLY'  The coroner's court heard no traces of alcohol were found in her system, but there was the presence of a drug used for insomnia.  A family lawyer previously said the television personality died by suicide.  Caroline stepped down from hosting ITV2's hit show Love Island after she was arrested. She was bailed after the first court hearing, but was banned from contacting Lewis before the trial.  Her suicide was the latest connected to Love Island, following the deaths of contestants Mike Thalassitis, 26, in March 2019 and Sophie Gradon, 32, in June 2018.  Miss Gradon's boyfriend Aaron Armstrong, 25, died three weeks after he found his girlfriend.  The Met Police has already referred itself to the police watchdog over its contact with Caroline before her death - which cops say is standard practice.

The 27-year-old has a Masters degree in film making but struggled to land a career in the media industry after graduating in May 2015.  18 Charlotte Gorick enrolled onto a Â£100 Microsoft Excel course to help her secure a full-time job  She instead turned to waitressing and bar work on zero-hour contracts to get by.  But a ten-week course learning how to use Excel gave her a new skillset to show employers and she soon landed a job as a hotel receptionist with a 40-hour contract.  This full-time role enabled the graduate to start putting aside the cash needed to save for a deposit, as well as meaning she had a stable job to secure a mortgage.  Typically, banks and lenders allow home buyers to borrow 4.5 times their annual salary and if youâre on a zero-hour contract, youâll usually need two yearsâ worth of bank statements to prove your earnings.

Don't forget to join the Sun Money's first-time buyer Facebook group for the latest tips on buying your first home.  As well as getting a full-time job, Charlotte credits switching her food shop from Tesco to Aldi, and nights out with friends coming over for tea, in helping her save up.  She was also lucky to live with her parents while she saved, paying just Â£120 a month in rent.  But it wasn't all plain sailing, and Charlotte had to delay moving in after getting the keys to her place in January 2020, due to a damp problem that needed sorting.  Doors and windows also needed to be replaced, with Charlotte forking out Â£2,025 to fix both issues. She's now learned how important it is to thoroughly check properties.  Charlotte finally moved in in March 2020, just before the coronavirus crisis hit. We caught up with her for our My First Home series.  18 Charlotte describes the interior as ""industrial chic""  18 The living area has splashes of mustard yellow to add a touch of colour  18 Charlotte has kept to a neutral colour scheme of whites, creams and greys  18 The living room space connects to the kitchen  Whatâs your new home like?  Itâs a two-bed, mid-terrace property in Kingâs Lynn, Norfolk.  Iâve got two bedrooms, two reception rooms and an upstairs family bathroom and kitchen extension.  I've converted the outbuilding, which would have been used as an old coal shed when it was first built in the 1900s, into a utility room.  Iâve got a little garden and shed as well. I donât have a driveway or private parking but I can park in front of my house on the road.  I completed on 29 January and I moved in on 23 March.  How much is it worth and how much deposit did you put down?  I managed to get an offer accepted on the asking price, which was Â£120,000.  For my deposit, I put down Â£40,000 - so around 33 per cent of the total property value.  I saved up Â£15,000, including a Help to Buy Isa bonus of Â£1,000, and had Â£30,000 gifted to me from my parents.  I kept Â£5,000 of this aside to decorate but ended up spending most of this on fixing some major issues with the property.  18 The kitchen area is clean and spacious with plenty of room for one person  18 Charlotte has kept the decoration in her bedroom to a minimum  18 The bedroom is now filled with personal touches  18 Charlotte has has an electric fireplace, which she's decorated with a mirror on top  How did you start saving for your first home?  I started saving after completing a Masters in Film Studies at Kingston University in May 2015.  I'd worked as a barmaid inbetween my undergraduate and Masters degrees, and had around Â£3,000 saved up by the time I moved back home with my mum and step-dad in King's Lynn.  At the time I was working as a waitress on a zero hours contract and I was just saving however much I could.  My wages would vary between Â£600 and Â£1,500 a month, so I'd always put away at least Â£400 a month into my savings.  But after speaking to most lenders, I realised the most I could borrow was around Â£18,000 which wasnât even worth talking about given property prices in the area.  What help is out there for first-time buyers? GETTING on the property ladder can feel like a daunting task but there are schemes out there to help first-time buyers have their own home.  Help to Buy Isa - It's a tax-free savings account where for every Â£200 you save, the Government will add an extra Â£50. But there's a maximum limit of Â£3,000 which is paid to your solicitor when you move. These accounts have now closed to new applicants but those who already hold one have until November 2029 to use it. Help to Buy equity loan - The Government will lend you up to 20 per cent of the home's value - or 40 per cent in London - after you've put down a five per cent deposit. The loan is on top of a normal mortgage but it can only be used to buy a new build property. Lifetime Isa - This is another Government scheme that gives anyone aged 18 to 39 the chance to save tax-free and get a bonus of up to Â£32,000 towards their first home. You can save up to Â£4,000 a year and the Government will add 25 per cent on top. Shared ownership - Co-owning with a housing association means you can buy a part of the property and pay rent on the remaining amount. You can buy anything from 25 to 75 per cent of the property but you're restricted to specific ones. ""First dibs"" in London - London Mayor Sadiq Khan is working on a scheme that will restrict sales of all new-build homes in the capital up to Â£350,000 to UK buyers for three months before any overseas marketing can take place. Starter Home Initiative - A Government scheme that will see 200,000 new-build homes in England sold to first-time buyers with a 20 per cent discount by 2020. To receive updates on the progress of these homes you can register your interest on the Starter Homes website.  I knew I needed a better job, so I enrolled into a ten-week Microsoft Excel evening course at The College of West Anglia, which cost Â£100.  It allowed me to learn new skills and helped me get a full-time job as a hotel receptionist in July 2018.  This is still my job today and Iâm contracted for 40 hours on a salary of Â£1,200 a month.  With my full-time job, I was able to put away double at Â£800 a month, which was around two thirds of my wages.  I'd put Â£200 a month into a Help to Buy Isa and then another Â£600 a month into a separate account.  Luckily, my parents were very generous and allowed me to stay with them for Â£120 a month in rent, and I made lots of cutbacks.  Paying off car insurance, annually rather than monthly, for example and having friends round for a cup of tea instead of meals out and trips to the theatre.  I also switched my food shop from Tesco to Aldi.  It took me a year and a half to gradually save up roughly Â£11,000 in my main savings account.  I also had Â£4,000 in a Help to Buy Isa along with a government bonus of Â£1,000.  My parents contributed Â£30,000 towards the rest of the deposit.  They've told me I don't need to pay it back as well, which is unbelievably kind. I couldn't have done it without them.  What problems did you find with the property?  I didn't hire a surveyor prior to purchasing because I had already spent about Â£1,200 on surveying three previous properties where the sale eventually fell through.  I had also been looking for almost a year at this point and just really wanted to move.  But I found the property had a huge damp problem shortly after getting the keys, which meant I didn't move in for two months.  I'd always plan to spend a month decorating, so the issues delayed me moving in by another month.  King's Lynn has five rivers running through the town centre which have flooded a few times in the past 50 years, so it seems this is a common issue in the area.  There was built up concrete in the garden that meant surface water was able to get in through gaps in air vents in the walls of the property.  I had to take all the skirting boards off in the living room, re-fill some of the area and damp-proof the entire room.  I had the concrete taken up so the water drains away now, instead of into the house.  It cost me Â£280 to pay someone to fix the concrete in the garden, plus Â£20 to replace the skirting boards, which I did myself.  I also coated each wall in damp-proof sealant but luckily there were tubs of this in the garden shed.  Unfortunately, I also had some bad flooding during a heavy downpour a few weeks after moving in.  My garden was four and a half inches under water and water was coming in through the kitchen door as well.  I got my mum and brother round and we were funnelling buckets of water out of the garden. Luckily it didnât cause any damage to my kitchen floor.  This cost me another Â£90 for an emergency plumber and a further Â£494 for a survey to check there wasn't an issue with the main water pipes - thankfully, the pipes are ok.  I've also had to fork out an additional Â£800 to have rendering redone all around my garden due to water damage, as well as having a wall dismantled and rebuilt.  On top of that, I spent Â£110 on aco drains, which I installed myself, to help take water away from the house.  These extra expenses were paid for out of my monthly paycheck.  What is a property survey and how much does it cost? THE Home Owners Alliance describes a property survey as a detailed inspection of a building's condition. It's not a legal requirement to have one, but it can help flag potential issues that could end up costing you money in months or years to come. Most qualified surveyors are members of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS). How much does a property survey cost? Survey costs vary from company to company, and depend on the size and location of the property. The cheapest property survey you can get starts from Â£249 for an RICS Condition Report. This is a basic write-up on the condition of the property but it doesn't provide any advice for the home buyer. Acording to Money Advice Service, is most suitable for new-build and conventional homes in good condition. The next type of survey is an RICS HomeBuyer Report, which starts from Â£400 and provides more detail than a Condition Report. This type of survey looks for structural problems but doesnât look beyond the floorboards or behind the walls. Finally, the most in-depth type of survey is the RICS Building Survey, which typically costs Â£400 to Â£500. This provides the most detailed report and will give advice on defects, repairs and maintenance options.  Did you find any other issues?  I also had to get new front and back doors and windows because they didnât close properly.  The new doors cost Â£1,600, including hiring a contractor to fit them.  Then I had to spend another Â£125 to get the windows repaired so they shut properly and locked.  I didnât realise the house would need so much work.  I had two viewings. On the first viewing, the house looked pretty much ready to move into.  But when I came to actually move in, and suddenly I didnât have someone elseâs furniture in the way, I started to see all these issues.  If I'd have known, I definitely would have tried to haggle the asking price down by at least Â£2,000.  But I don't regret not getting a surveyor because I loved the property and would have still ended up paying to get the issues fixed.  18 The garden needed a lot of work after flooding ruined Charlotte's outside space  18 The work in progress on the garden  18 Charlotte just needs to put down new paving slabs, which she'll do herself  18 Charlotte spent Â£765 on converting the out outhouse into a utility room  18 This is what her utility space looks like now  18 The second bedroom is being used as a study area  How did you decide on your location?  I wanted to move to London but it became obvious very quickly that I couldnât afford anything decent myself.  I also looked up north in much cheaper places such as Sheffield, but didnât find anything I liked.  My family live in Kingâs Lynn and Iâve got good transport links here to the rest of the country, so I decided to stay put.  Iâll consider buying elsewhere for my next home but at least Iâve got my foot on the ladder now.  How did you find your new home?  I found my property on Rightmove.  I knew roughly what I could borrow and what I had to spend, so I just set all the filters to what I could afford.  Before I found this home, I had three properties fall through.  They either turned out to be too expensive or too much of a project.  How have you decorated your new home?  Iâve gone for an industrial chic look, so lots of brown leather and wooden flooring which was already there.  Iâve given all the walls a lick of paint but on the whole, I've kept the decor largely the same.  I found a 10 litre tub of magnolia in the shed which was barely touched, so I gave it a good stir and Iâve been using that.  Between my dad and I, we managed to tackle a lot of the smaller DIY jobs like painting, laying tiles and filling the walls.  I had to get a plumber and electrician in to set up the utility room - this cost Â£765.  Have you had to spend much on furniture?  I've spent Â£713 on a bed and mattress, Â£586 on a sofa and Â£423 on white appliances - these are the biggest purchases.  Again, I've been super lucky that my family have been able to help me out.  My dad gave me a small wardrobe and recliner chair, and my nan gave me another chair.  How did you feel when you finally got the keys?  I just couldnât believe the moment had finally arrived - it was all a bit overwhelming.  It didnât feel like my home at first, largely because of how long it took to move in.  It wasn't until I spent the first night inside the property that it really sunk in.  18 Despite the issues, Charlotte is thrilled to be in her first home  The new property features plenty of cute quirks, such as this welcome note by the front door  18 The front of Charlotte's house steps straight out onto the street  What advice would you give to other first time buyers?  If you can afford not to, donât spend all your money on just buying the property.  My estate agent told me not to bankrupt myself buying a house - and Iâm really glad I kept some money aside.  They said save a nest egg because theyâll always be something that needs fixing.  Next time I go to buy a house, I also wonât be embarrassed to ask people to move their furniture out of the way so I can take a proper look.

Four Canadians have been approved to receive psilocybin therapy to help treat their end-of-life anxiety.  4 Thomas Hartle is one patient who will be given a legal trip on magic mushrooms Credit: FACEBOOK  4 The Canadian government will allow terminally ill patients to take the drug Credit: Getty - Contributor  The main ingredient of the drug is psilocybin, which at high doses can cause hallucinations.  The use of psilocybin in Canada was made illegal in 1974.  This is the first time that an exemption has been given in the country for patients to access psychedelic substance therapy.  Thomas Hartle of Saskatoon is one of the four individuals who will be given a legal dosage of magic mushrooms.  The 52-year-old's anxiety about his end of life was reportedly making his days ""unbearable"" and his current anti-anxiety medication wasn't having the designed effect.  ""It gives you a rapid heart rate. It makes you feel terrible,"" he told CTV in June.  Speaking following the landmark ruling on Tuesday, another applicant Laurie Brooks from British Columbia said: ""The acknowledgement of the pain and anxiety that I have been suffering with means a lot to me and I am feeling quite emotional today as a result.""  She never considered taking the drug but she changed her mind after her cancer had returned.  Laurie's doctor told her that she had between six months and a year to live unless she underwent radiation, chemotherapy and surgery.  ""I hope this is just the beginning and that soon all Canadians will be able to access psilocybin for therapeutic use, to help with the pain they are experiencing, without having to petition the government for months to gain permission,"" she said.  4 Psilocybin has the potential to provide long-term relief for anxiety, a study claims Credit: Alamy  Research shows that psilocybin has the potential to provide long-term relief for anxiety and depression as terminally ill patients suffer from end of life distress.  One study showed that up to 80 per cent of patients in a trial reported reductions in depression and anxiety.  The study also revealed that patients showed an improvement in attitudes towards death.  In Canada, the drug remains illegal. The sale, production and possession of magic mushrooms is prohibited unless authorised for clinical purposes, according to Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.  The side effects of psilocybin include hallucinations, anxiety and panic attacks, increased heart rate and increased blood pressure.  Denver became the first US city to effectively decriminalise magic mushrooms in May 2019.  Initiative 301 ordered police to treat the possession of the drug as their ""lowest priority"" and bars the use of city resources or money to impose penalties.  The resolution passed narrowly with 50.6 per cent of the vote, by a margin of 1,979.

The former Juventus and Bayern Munich striker, 34, was linked with a move to United in the winter window but instead moved to Qatar.  1 Mario Mandzukic is a free agent after terminating his contract with Al-Duhail Credit: Getty - Contributor  But, after just just seven months and as many games played Mandzukic announced his stint in the Middle East was over.  The Red Devils are close to landing Jadon Sancho in a record Â£110million deal.  There has been a breakthrough in negotiations as the Red Devils have forced the Germans into accepting staggered payments, with Â£70m up front - but the deal could still wipe out most of their summer budget.  And boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has told United chief Ed Woodward that he'd like a new winger, centre-back and striker as part of a summer transfer splurge.  However, while Hargreaves agrees the club need a centre forward, he reckons Solskjaer can save his funds by landing free agent Mandzukic.  The former Bayern Munich ace said: ""Defensively they were one of the better teams in the league, but in terms of goalscoring they were way behind Liverpool and City,  ""You can do with a 20-goal scorer but I think Iâd take Jadon [Sancho] first and then maybe get Mandzukic on a free.""  Mandzukic has also been linked with a move back to Italy, with AC Milan reportedly interested.  It is understood San Siro bosses see the veteran striker as a direct replacement for Zlatan Ibrahimovic, whose contract expires at the end of the season.  United's funds have been boosted by finally managing to offload Alexis Sanchez, after Inter Milan took him off their hands on Wednesday night.

Instead, you'll need to tell staff which strength Peri Peri sauce you want, and they'll bring it to your table.  In addition, diners will be asked to order and pay for their food via an app - but they can still pay by speaking to a cashier if they want to.  Nando's continues to have a reduced menu in place although the majority of fan favourites are still on the menu.  This includes Peri Peri chicken wings, halloumi and Peri Peri chips.

A Covid-19 simulation tool has found that while a second wave is on the cards for the capital, the outbreak is likely to be significantly less severe than the first.  â ï¸ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates  3 The simulator predicted that a second wave is likely across London Credit: BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON  At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, London was one of the worst hit areas in the UK.  Many office buildings closed due to confirmed cases and gradually the city shut down.  Experts at Brunel University have created a tool that will allow local authorities to forecast the effects of local lockdown measures.  The tool has been used in several boroughs in London.  Dr Derek Groen, a lecturer in simulation and modelling at Brunel University London said: âThe results between boroughs has so far varied a lot, so weâre trying to understand better why that is.  âThe models definitely see a second wave in almost all cases, although it looks much less deep than the first wave, but it could be more prolonged.â  3 The example map above shows how local authorities could pin point outbreaks Credit: BRUNEL UNIVERSITY LONDON  The tool has already been used in areas such as North London.  It could help local councils decide on further restrictions such as quarantining certain areas or buildings or closing local shops.  Regardless of the measures put in place in the capital, experts say a second wave is likely and described their simulation tool as âpessimisticâ.  The tool was validated up to 80 days by Brunel Universityâs Dr David Bell.  Dr Bell and the team used data supplied by the London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust.  3 Londoners could see a second wave - but experts say it won't be as harsh as the first Credit: Darren Fletcher - The Sun  It has a wide range of local interventions such as shutting pubs, limiting access to parks and placing restrictions on households.  Dr Groen added: âThe idea that your local Morrisons will be featured in a simulation is very uncommon.  âOur simulations allow authorities to see the impact of things like closing a local supermarket, or changing the constraints placed on schools or businesses at a very local level.â  The experts have developed full simulations for London boroughs such as Brent, Ealing, Hillingdon, and Harrow.  More basic forecasts have been produced for Westminster, Kensington, Fulham and Chelsea.  Several scenarios have been accounted for which includes areas that take no measures and areas that extend into a further lockdown.  All lockdown scenarios showed a decrease in local infections.  It uses OpenStreetMaps to allow modellers to understand how a disease spreads through the population.  They are based on assumptions drawn on scientific literature including how infectious a person is and how many people stick to social distancing.  Dr Groen said itâs not clear at the moment how many people are wearing masks but said the simulator works by choosing different numbers and seeing how they combine with other factors.

Around 16 people, including ten small children, landed on Dungeness beach in Kent around 8.30am today on what could be a record day for migrant arrivals.  8 A heavily pregnant woman crossed the channel to a beach in Kent this morning  8 Border Force officials pictured with a rubber ring from the boat Credit: Steve Finn  8 The pregnant woman appeared weary as she held her head in her hand  8 A young child who crossed the channel to Kent  The pregnant woman, whose baby is thought to be due in around a month, looked weary as she held onto a child and buried her face in her hand on the beach.  She is believed to have arrived with a group of migrants who were using just one small boat and a rubber ring.  More vessels have been detected off the coast of Kent including an inflatable kayak.  The children who arrived in the UK today all wore coats - and one girl wore a fluffy red onesie.  One of the kids, a boy aged around four, looked exhausted as he laid back on the pebbles with his arms spread out.  'HEARTBREAKING'  Border Force, police and paramedics were at the scene and all of the migrants had their temperatures taken.  Speaking of today's arrivals, amateur photographer Susan Pilcher, who saw them on the beach, said: ""I could hear the Border Force workers asking how many months pregnant she was and she said eight.  It must be such a frightening thing to do. It's heartbreaking - you can't imagine what they've been through. Susan Pilcher  ""They didn't speak much English at all.  ""When you think that she's doing such a risky crossing over the Channel when she's heavily pregnant, that says how much they've been through.  ""It must be such a frightening thing to do.

Border Force officers from across the south coast have been scrambled to numerous incidents of small boats crossing the Channel and making it to the UK in recent days.  Last week, 202 asylum seekers crossed the Channel in just one day - a new record.  The number who have crossed the Channel this year alone is nearly double the 1,892 for the whole of 2019.  It is believed many will attempt to cross today because of the calm sea and good visibility.  'TRYING TO EMPTY SEA WITH SPOON'  It comes after France bungled efforts to stop migrants crossing the channel into the UK, with Calais' MP moaning it is like âtrying to empty the sea with a spoon"".

The 28-year-old is also appealing against his murder conviction after a jury found him guilty of strangling her to death, and he was caged for 17 years - a sentence his lawyer says is too harsh.  11 Grace Millane, 22, was last seen alive the day before her birthday in December 2018 in Auckland, New Zealand Credit: PA Media  11 She died in an Auckland apartment in December, 2018 Credit: PA:Press Association  11 A suitcase found in the apartment of the man found guilty of murdering Grace Millane Credit: PA:Press Association  11 The scene where New Zealand police found Grace's body in the Waitakere Ranges, near Auckland, on December 9, 2018 Credit: Getty Images - Getty  Despite the guilty verdict delivered in November 2019, the killer's identity still can not be revealed for legal reasons.  He has continued to claim her death was due to so-called ""rough sex"" and that it was a tragic accident.  His new lawyer Rachael Reed QC today told Justices Stephen Kos, Patricia Courtney and Mark Cooper that no person could consent to their own death, reports Stuff in New Zealand.  But, she said the jury should have considered whether Grace consented to the application of pressure to her neck and whether the Brit's killer exceeded the bounds of her consent.  âDid he have time to realise [consent] had occurred prior to her death and if he did, did he maintain an honest belief in consent at that time?"" she asked the Justices.  However Crown prosecutor Robin McCoubrey argued: âA woman canât be more exposed at that point in which sheâs engaging in sexual relations; she was particularly vulnerable.  âYouâre involved in the most intimate activity - the last thing on your mind is that youâre about to be murdered by your sexual partner.â  11 British backpacker Grace Millane was murdered in NZ in a crime that sent shockwaves round the world Credit: PA:Press Association/PA Images  11 Grace was last seen on Saturday, December 1, 2018, the eve of her 22nd birthday, with her Tinder date, above Credit: PA Media  Backpacker Grace went missing on December 1, 2018 and failed to contact her family on her 22nd birthday December 2 while in Auckland, as part of a planned year-long trip abroad that began in Peru.  She was last seen alive entering a central Auckland hotel with a man on the evening of December 1.  On December 9, her body was found in a forested area about 10 metres (33ft) from the side of the road in the Waitakere Ranges near Auckland.  She died after meeting him through the dating app Tinder, going out for drinks, and then returning to his hotel apartment in central Auckland.  Prosecutors said the man then strangled Grace to death.  Brian Dickey told the trial that at some point, she would have lost consciousness, meaning the man would have needed to keep strangling her after she went lifeless under his grip.  11 Jurors rejected the defence claim the death was accidental and occurred during rough sex  One woman, who had previously dated the man, testified she had feared for her own life during a sexual encounter with him after the man sat on her face, restricting her breathing without her consent.  Prosecutors also said he took explicit photos of Grace's body after she died, and used Google to search for âWaitakere Rangesâ and âhottest fireâ as he tried to figure out how to dispose of her.  The court heard that he watched violent porn and went on another date while her corpse lay in his flat.  He stuffed her body into a suitcase, drove to a forest and buried it in a shallow grave, where police found it a week later, twisted '""in the foetal position"".  The killer hired a car and bought cleaning equipment to âcalmly, coldly and methodicallyâ remove traces of Graceâs blood from his carpet, said prosecutor Robin McCoubrey.  The prosecutor told the court she had been strangled until she bled through her nose.  11 Grace Millane's parents, David and Gillian Millane with Det Insp Scott Beard (left) at the Auckland High Court on November 6, 2019 Credit: Getty Images - Getty  11 Grace's parents, pictured outside court, thanked the people of New Zealand for their support during the trial Credit: AP:Associated Press  Defence lawyers claimed the death was accidental after the pair engaged in consensual erotic choking - so-called ""rough sex"" - that went too far.  Ian Brookie, defending, told the jury that although he did not blame Grace for her own death, it was an accident, not murder, âwhen an act designed to enhance their sexual pleasure went wrong and she died as a resultâ.  âWhatâs important here is that they were both keen to give it a go and they did,â said Mr Brookie.  But the jury didnât buy the defence, and after a three-week trial, they deliberated for about five hours before returning the guilty verdict  Now, his new lawyer is arguing he didnât get a fair trial and his sentence was too harsh.  Rachael Reed said today: âConsent shouldnât be removed just because someone has died.""  But, Justice Kos said her argument's implication was âgraveâ.  11 Grace Millane, a 22 year-old from Essex, was last seen alive entering the CityLife Hotel in Auckland New Zealand Credit: Social Media - Refer to Source  Reed was basically suggesting that someone who chose not to give evidence at trial, as Graceâs killer did, could then advance consent as a justification for death, Justice Kos added.  âI for one resist your proposition.â  Reed also questioned the expert evidence of forensic pathologist Dr Simon Stables and Dr Fintan Garavan about the strangulation and cause of death.  But Reed was told by Crown prosecutor Brian Dickey that 90 seconds was a long time to press on someoneâs neck.  âShe must have been resisting... and struggling for her life,â Dickey argued.  âYou don't just tap someone's neck and they die.â  Reed said she wouldn't try to excuse the fact that the killer took intimate photos of Grace's body after her death.  âI cannot [excuse his actions] as they are inexcusableâ and âabhorrentâ, she said.  Reed claimed bruising on Grace's body was not ""significant"".  She also criticised High Court Justice Simon Moore for placing too much weight on the killer's degree of callousness during the trial, Stuff reported.  11 The Brit had been on a year-long trip when she was brutally murdered Credit: Refer to Caption  Her client's actions after Graceâs death did not mean he was callous at the time of her death, Reed added.  Dickey challenged her comment, saying that consent wasn't a defence for murder.  He asked: âWhat actual evidence was there to sustain the proposition this was an accidental death in a consensual sexual encounter?  âNowhere in [one of the defendant's police interviews] does he link what he did to her death.  âWe have the most flimsy basis of consent.â  The Justices have reserved their decision.  BRITAIN TO OUTLAW 'ROUGH SEX' DEFENCE Britain is to become the first country to outlaw the ""rough sex"" defence in homicide trials, setting a precedent. The issue gained worldwide attention following the 2018 murder in New Zealand of British backpacker Grace Millane whose killer said she died accidentally during consensual sex. Women's rights campaigners say the normalisation of violent sex in popular culture means men facing criminal charges for harming women are increasingly claiming the violence was consensual. Lawmakers in Britain agreed late in July to include a new clause in the Domestic Abuse Bill that would end the use of the rough sex defence. ""We're thrilled. This is a really big deal,"" said Fiona Mackenzie, founder of campaign group We Can't Consent To This, which has led calls for a change in the law. ""MPs have voted to make it crystal clear that you cannot consent to serious violence or your own death. ""MPs are drawing a line in the sand and saying this is not acceptable."" Mackenzie said there had been 60 killings of women where the defence had been used and many more cases where women had been badly injured. The rough sex defence has often led to a lesser charge, lighter sentence or the investigation being dropped.

The American sports tycoon and his Walmart heiress wife purchased the United States' largest ranch in 2016 and it's so big you could fit the entire cities of New York and Los Angeles inside its borders.  13 The W.T Waggoner Ranch is the largest in the USA  13 The estate in Texas stretches over a staggering 535,000 acres  13 Kroenke paid Â£500m for the land in 2016  13 New York City AND Los Angeles would both fit inside its borders  At a whopping 535,000 acres, the W.T Waggoner Ranch in Texas was bought by Kroenke and his wife Ann Walton for a cool Â£500million.  The ranch includes thousands of cattle, hundreds of horses and oil wells, and 30,000 acres of farmland.  The 73-year-old billionaire's company Kroenke Sports and Entertainment owns Arsenal and recently cut 55 jobs due to financial issues at Emirates Stadium.  He also owns NFL side LA Rams, NBA team Denver Nuggets, NHL franchise Colorado Avalanche and MLS side Colorado Rapids.  And he is investing billions of dollars into the construction of the 70,000 seat SoFI Stadium in Inglewood, California, which will be home to the Rams and fellow NFL side LA Chargers.  When he secured the ranch in 2016, Kroenke said: âThis is an incredible opportunity and an even greater responsibility.  13 Enormous waterways travel through the vast property  13  Kroenke said he was honoured to protect the American landmark when he bought the ranch in 2016âWe are honoured to assume ownership of the Waggoner â a true Texas and American landmark â and are deeply committed to continuing the proud legacy of W.T. âTomâ Waggoner, his family and his descendants.  âOur gratitude to them and to the many parties involved in this process is immense. We will continue to preserve and protect this uniquely American treasure.â  Kroenke is a fairly unpopular figure at Arsenal and last summer Gunners fans issued a joint statement calling on him to reinvigorate the club but a spate of staff redundancies show problems have not gone away.  The statement said supporters had ""never felt more marginalised"". The club have since sacked Unai Emery and hired Mikel Arteta.  13 New York City could fit inside the ranch's border  13 And Los Angeles could still fit alongside NYC within the boundaries  However, Kroenke's wealth was brought into question again last month when Mesut Ozil refused to take a pay cut amid the coronavirus crisis.  Some of the Arsenal squad agreed to reductions but Ozil refused shortly before it emerged Kroenke's fortune soared by Â£323m in the opening months of 2020.  Reports also suggested Kroenke would make a large cash injection into Arsenal to ease the financial impact of Covid-19 on the club.  However the announcement that 55 staff were being made redundant despite European football being secured for next season has been held up as the latest example of mismanagement in the Kroenke regime.  Kroenke is married to Ann, whose father Bud was an early partner in Walmart, which was founded by his brother Sam.  In 2012, Kroenke bought another historic property, the 124,000-acre Broken O Ranch in Montana.  He also owns ranches in Wyoming, Arizona and British Columbia.  13 The ranch comes with 30,000 acres of farmland  13 Agricultural machinery is seen across the gigantic swathes of land  13 Oil wells are also dotted across the property in Northern Texas  13 Picturesque stone outhouses also feature on the land  13 Kroenke's estate stretches as far as the eye can see",https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/11665194/stan-kroenke-arsenal-ranch-waggoner-la-rams/,https://www.thesun.co.uk/feed/,f3bd661584c7848fa8c4b45fb13711fa59718d7582e4b46fab95fdad16d2e058,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Despite the disturbingly sexual element of the event, the child's mum happily takes her along â this is just what it takes to make it as a junior idol.  9 Yune, an 11-year-old junior idol, performing on stage in a French maid's outfit  Junior idols are singers and models who are marketed as stars from a very young age in Japan, which can even include pre-teen children.  Although some see it as a way of building an audience before adulthood, the junior idol subculture has been criticised for sexualising young girls for an audience overwhelmingly made up of middle-aged men.  And in a country where possession of child sex abuse images wasn't made illegal until 2014, many think the practice is dangerous.  Now a new Marcel Theroux documentary, Unreported World: Schoolgirl Pin-Ups, delves into the creepy culture by following one junior idol's quest for stardom.  9 Men watching an idol group performing - some say the subculture sexualises young girls Credit: AFP - Getty  ""I think itâs dangerous,"" one junior idols tells Theroux when asked if other fans in the culture are sexually attracted to children.  ""Of course, not everyone has this feeling. But when I talk to them, many are dangerous.â  Creepy messages and sexual lyrics  The Channel 4 documentary covers the life of Yune â who was scouted into the seedy junior idol business when she was just six years old.  Now 11, she's constantly working to grow her audience in Japan, which boasts the second biggest music industry on Earth.  âIâve always dreamed of standing on stage at the Budokan,"" Yune tells Theroux, referring to the 14,500-seater Tokyo stadium that's hosted the likes of The Beatles and Taylor Swift.  9 Yune dreams of performing at the Nippon Budokan area in Tokyo - many adult stars in Japan were once junior idols Credit: Kyodo News Stills - Getty  To help her realise Yune's pop star dream, her mum takes her to junior idol gigs and helps her with her weekly broadcasts on a live streaming app called Showroom.  âI think for Yune, people come for her singing voice,â Yune's mum tells Theroux.  But she also recognises there's a darker side to the junior idol business, keeping her address a secret and carefully moderating all the comments on Yune's livestreams before her daughter sees them.  In one broadcast, which is watched by over 100 fans, Yune sings: ""Give me, give me your love, kiss me baby, wonât you pamper me sometimes?""  At the end of the broadcast, in which adult fans can send her cash presents, one 38-year-old man tells her she's ""very beautiful"".  Despite the questionable comments, Yune's mum isn't worried.  ""We have to think of a balance,"" she tells Theroux. ""One doesnât have to see what one doesnât have to see.  ""But when youâre trying to achieve something, there will always be obstacles.â  Adult superfans desperate for pictures  Even seedier than the livestreams are the live shows, in which 200 men flock into a concert hall to see a showcase of the girls in the flesh.  After the Â£30 performance, fans can then queue up to meet the children afterwards, paying another Â£7 for a CD or signed Polaroid.  9 Adult men make up the vast majority of the junior idol audience - here, Yune is filmed alongside another 12-year-old idol at a birthday party show  But many fans just want to have their photo taken with the junior idols themselves â one even asks Yune to handcuff herself to him in a picture.  ""This kind of culture is kind of a little bit growing and blooming in Japan, but still, most of the Japanese think itâs not a good culture,"" one fan tells Theroux.  ""We enjoy her performance in a gentlemanâs way, so no pressure, no harassment, but we support her play and her growing up.â  The 38-year-old who told Yune she was beautiful on the livestream even pays extra to do his own private photo shoots of her after shows.  9 Possessing child abuse images was only made an offence in Japan six years ago Credit: AP:Associated Press  The superfan, called Koji, slavishly attends Yune's gigs, even travelling to Taiwan and the Philippines to watch her.  âI do find it really weird,"" Theroux says. ""Thereâs something strange about seeing these middle-aged men who are basically starstruck by these 11-year-old girls.â  'Normal people think we are creepy'  Even Yune's own manager understands what he's exposing the little girl to.  ""I canât judge if the audience is watching in a sexual way,"" Mr Karimata tells Theroux.  ""All I can do is protect her if someone in the room tries to touch her.â  9 Sexualised images of schoolgirls are commonly used in advertising in some parts of Tokyo Credit: AFP - Getty  The disturbing sexual element of her followers is also something the men who follow her recognise.  ""Normal people think we are creepy,"" Koji says.  ""Wherever I go, people think the same way.â  But when pressed if junior idols fans are sexually attracted to children, Koji confirms the grim reality.  9 Theroux says it's still easy to find materials portraying young girls in a sexual context for sale in Tokyo Credit: Getty Images - Getty  âTo be honest there were fans of Yune like that. I think itâs dangerous,"" he says.  ""Of course, not everyone has this feeling. But when I talk to them, many are dangerous.â  Lonely men looking for 'virtual love'  Some people who have studied the junior idol phenomenon think part of the obsession stems from Japan's epidemic of loneliness.  Over 12million adults under the age of 40 in the country - which has a population of 126.5million - aren't in a relationship, leading to a whole service industry catering to satisfying the needs of lonely men.  9 Waitresses at a 'maid cafe' in Tokyo, where lonely men pay for young girls' company Credit: AFP - Getty  One notorious example are the ""maid cafes"", in which blokes pay to be served drinks by young girls dressed as french maids.  âFor people who come [to maid cafes] their actual life and families seem false, like a fake world,"" says Prof Masahiro Yamada, a sociologist who has studied loneliness in Japan.  ""When they come here, they feel more like themselves.""  Prof Yamada estimates that a quarter of all Japanese people under 40 won't ever get married, and they turn to alternative ""virtual love"" to fill the gap.  9 The controversial cafes are part of a Japanese industry to serve lonely men Credit: Getty Images - Getty  ""People are looking for a fantasy family, such as a sister, mother or lover,"" he says.  ""In the case of idols, itâs a daughter. Satisfying people who want a fantasy family has become a business.â  But despite loneliness being a factor in the spread of the junior idol subculture, Theroux remains wary of its risks.

The Chilean forward, 31, joined the Old Trafford ranks in January 2018 as part of a swap deal with Arsenal, as Henrikh Mkhitaryan moved the other way.  2 The financial impact of Alexis Sanchez at Man Utd in full  2 Man Utd are still paying Alexis Sanchez Â£395,000 a week for him to play at Inter Milan Credit: EPA  At the time, fans believed the club had played a blinder in signing a superstar without paying a penny.  However, the ""free"" signing has actually cost the club an eye-watering Â£60m - with just THREE Premier League goals to show for it.  Man Utd have struggled to compete with the big-boys of English football since Sir Alex Ferguson retired in 2013.  And the signing of Sanchez was supposed to be the turning point - with the club happy to splash out on his wages.  But the dream quickly turned into a nightmare.  In 18 months, Sanchez managed just three Premier League goals - and five goals in total.  In those first 79 weeks, Man Utd paid Sanchez an obscene Â£39.9m.  Eager to get his pay-packet off the books, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looked to sell Sanchez last summer - with no-one either willing or able to afford him.  Eventually, Man Utd allowed the Chilean to join Inter Milan on a season-long loan.  But even then, the Serie A giants were only willing to contribute around 20 per cent of his wages, at Â£110,000 a week in total.  In the 49 weeks Sanchez has been in Italy, Inter have paid him just Â£5.4m, with Man Utd paying the remaining Â£19.4m of wages owed.  That means, since moving to Old Trafford, Sanchez has been paid a total sum of Â£59.3m by Man Utd.  All in all, that equates to around Â£20m per Premier League goal scored and Â£12m per goal across all competitions.  And it was later revealed Sanchez cost Man Utd Â£28,000 per TOUCH of the ball during his torrid.  United have now managed to offload Sanchez, after Inter Milan took him off their hands on Wednesday night.

The tech giant is currently racing against a September deadline to finalise a buy-out of the hugely popular Chinese app.  4 TikTok could be acquired by US tech giant Microsoft for $30million Credit: AFP  This week it emerged that Microsoft may still go ahead with a mega-acquisition of Chinese-owner social media app TikTok.  Talks were thrown into disarray as US President Donald Trump warned he could ban the app as soon as Monday.  But Trump later backed down after a phone call with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and gave the firm a September 15 deadline to wrap up buy-out talks.  Now CNBC reports that the deal could be finalised ""within the next three weeks"", ahead of Trump's deadline.  4 Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has talked Trump into allowing TikTok acquisition talks to go ahead Credit: Microsoft / Brian Smale / Wikimedia Commons  The deal is expected to be valued at anywhere from $10billion to $30billion, according to the report.  At the higher end, it would dwarf many major tech acquisitions â including Facebook's 2014 purchase of WhatsApp for $16billion.  But it's still small change for Microsoft, which is currently valued at $1.61trillion on the US stock market.  And at the end of 2019, Microsoft had roughly $135billion in a liquid cash pile.  Part of the deal would also involve Microsoft bringing all of TikTok's code from China to the US within a year.  Microsoft's chief managed to help convince Trump about how beneficial a TikTok buy-out could be for the US.  ""We had a great conversation. He called me to see how I felt about it,"" Trump explained.  ""And I said look, it can't be controlled â for security reasons â by China. Too big, too invasive.  ""Here's the deal. I don't mind if â whether it's Microsoft or somebody else â a big company, a secure company, a very American company buy it.""  He also described TikTok by saying: ""The name is hot, the brand is hot.""  But his praise of a potential deal came with a major warning: the US Treasury would need to benefit from any deal struck.  It's not clear how this would work, or through what mechanism money would be paid, as usually the Treasury wouldn't gain a portion of a private corporate acquisition.  ""I said that a very substantial portion of that price is going to have to come into the Treasury of the United States,"" said Trump.  ""Because we're making it possible for this deal to happen.""  He added that an ""appropriate deal"" would mean ""the Treasury...gets a lot of money"".  It's still possible that Trump will decide to ban TikTok over national security concerns.  But buying the app could be a huge coup for Microsoft and the US, as TikTok serves more than 100million American users.  It would give Microsoft a better chance of competing with major social media rivals, in particular Facebook.  4 Navarro spoke with Judge Jeanine on Saturday evening Credit: Fox News  The September 15 deadline is being imposed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which regulates international deals based on security risks.  President Trump is expected to make a decision on banning TikTok soon as White House advisor Peter Navarro called the social app a ânational security threatâ.  During an interview with Judge Jeanine on Fox News, Navarro called Trumpâs decision due to be announced on Monday, a âgood thingâ.  According to the Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy, TikTok has been sending American information including user-location back to its servers in China.  Navarro claims that all personal information is â potentially going right back to the Chinese communist party, the Chinese military and the Chinese government.â  He continued: âThey can use these social media apps to steal your personal information, your business information and also Judge, they use these social media apps to track you and surveil you and monitor your movements.â  Navarro also stated that the app is a ânational security threatâ and that the President and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been monitoring the appâs movement of information.  The adviser asked viewers that if they are using TikTok âto get on the Trump trainâ and delete the app as it is âdangerousâ.  TikTok is a Chinese-owned video app that's become popular among Americans in the last two years or so.  Users on the app create, watch, and engage with videos that range from fun dance trends to beekeepers rescuing honeybees.  It was the worldâs second most downloaded app in the third quarter of 2019, with an estimated 176 million downloads.  The decision to ban TikTok could have a serious impact on young voters in the upcoming 2020 US Presidential election.  4 Boris Johnson risks a major row with Donald Trump after allowing controversial Chinese app TikTok a London HQ Credit: Reuters  Meanwhile, Boris Johnson has risked a major row with Donald Trump after allowing TikTok to build a London HQ.

If you donât, look at ways to cut your costs Pay off more than the minimum - If youâve got credit card debts aim to pay off more than the minimum amount on your credit card each month to bring down your bill quicker Pay your most expensive credit card sooner - If you have more than one credit card and canât pay them off in full each month, prioritise the most expensive card (the one with the highest interest rate) Prioritise your debts - If youâve got several debts and you canât afford to pay them all itâs important to prioritise them Your rent, mortgage, council tax and energy bills should be paid first because the consequences can be more serious if you don't pay Get advice - If youâre struggling to pay your debts month after month itâs important you get advice as soon as possible, before they build up even further Groups like Citizens Advice and Money Advice Trust can help you prioritise and negotiate with your creditors to offer you more affordable repayment plans  In some cases, lenders also used so-called ""nudge"" techniques by promoting a message that repeat borrowing is the norm, it added.  The review covered lenders providing products including guarantor loans, high-cost short-term credit, logbook loans and rent-to-own.  The firms must now review their relending operations and make any necessary changes to improve the outcome for consumers. These include:  Improve affordability checks to ensure that relending doesn't cause consumer harm, especially for vulnerable customers  Make sure marketing material is balanced to help customers make more informed decisions  Not charge early settlement fees when a customer refinances their loan  The FCA told lenders to be more aware of their most vulnerable customers, which include high-cost credit customers and borrowers with poor credit history, who may be borrowing money to pay down existing debt.  In these cases, forbearance or debt advice may be better than additional lending, it said.  Forbearance is temporary postponement of repayments agreed by the lender and customer.  Jonathan Davidson, FCA's executive director of supervision, retail and authorisations, said: ""We have significant concerns that repeat borrowing could be a strong indicator of levels of debt that are harmful to the customer.  ""Before the pandemic we saw increasing numbers of complaints about high-cost lendersâ relending practices, which showed that firms had failed to adequately assess affordability, and they were not relending in a way that was sustainable for customers.  ""We expect firms to review their relending practices in light of our findings as they start to lend again, and to make any necessary changes to improve customer outcomes.  ""We will continue working with firms to raise standards, and we will continue to take action where we see harm.""  Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform AJ Bell, said the regulator is ""clearly worried"" about lenders using misleading marketing and pushy tactics to keep customers in high-cost debt.  She added: ""Lots of people are using payday loans or doorstep lending either to pay their normal bills or to pay off other debt, which becomes a very slippery slope thatâs tough to get out of.  âAny crackdown on these practices would be good news for consumers at a time when many find themselves in spiralling debt.  ""This is particularly the case as the COVID-19 measures introduced by the regulator to ease the burden of debt, such as payment holidays or reductions in interest rates, start to be unwound and people face hefty bills for their borrowing.""  âBut those in debt should be offered help, rather than just denied more credit.""  If you're struggling with debt, make sure you contact your lender as soon as possible and ask for help.

And Ramez al-Qadi, a prominent TV anchor, tweeted: ""Either they keep killing us or we kill them.""  The city's mood changed from one of utter devastation to fury after it emerged state officials were aware of the warehouse packed with illegal chemicals and had been warned it could ""blow up all of Beirut.""  The revelation fuelled new fury among a population already rocked by a financial crisis which has left half the country in poverty.  Demonstrators in downtown Beirut attacked the convoy of former Lebanese prime minister Saad Hariri and brawled with his bodyguards in the most overt display of anger since Tuesday's explosion.

The government has vowed to investigate the disaster and has urged the military to place those responsible for storing the explosive substance under house arrest.

The Port of Beirut and customs office is notorious for being one of the most corrupt and lucrative institutions in Lebanon where various factions and politicians, including Hezbollah, hold sway.  The investigation is focusing on how 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical used in fertilizers, came to be stored at the facility for six years, and why nothing was done about it.  26 A blast survivor is saved from the wreckage of his home Credit: AP:Associated Press  26 A massive clean up operation is now underway across Beirut Credit: Reuters  26 A survivor is pulled from the rubble of a collapsed building Credit: AP:Associated Press  26 The deadly explosion was one of the biggest non-nuclear blasts in history Credit: AP:Associated Press  26 The blast killed at least 135 people and left thousands injured Credit: Alamy Live News  Earlier the Sun Online told how a picture emerged said to show bags of ammonium nitrate packed into the warehouse.  Port officials have however pointed the finger at the government as they claimed to have repeatedly warned the authorities of the dangerous cargo at Warehouse 12.  The startling photo appears to show the storage facility shoddily packed with one ton bags of the chemical - which is known to be used by terrorists in homemade bombs.  Investigative website Bellingcat analysed the photo and said it does appear to match the dock warehouse which exploded yesterday afternoon.  BBC journalist Riam Dalati also tweeted a copy of the photo, saying it appears to show workers stacking the salvaged ammonium nitrate at Warehouse 12.  Thousands were injured in the fireball which flattened buildings, ripped people's clothes from their bodies and damaged properties up to six miles away.  The blast - which has caused up to Â£4bn worth of damage - was so large it could be heard 110 miles across the sea in Cyprus.  It has emerged the powder-keg of chemicals was shipped by Russian businessman Igor Grechushkin who has been accused of abandoning it in Beirut.  The killer cargo was confiscated in 2014 from the Moldovan-flagged ship Rhosus while en route from Batumi in the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia to Mozambique  26 A woman cries at a vigil to honour those killed in the explosion Credit: Rex Features  26 Lebanese people from around the world have been united in grief Credit: Rex Features  26 A woman lights a candle with her son during a vigil in Canada to honour those who died Credit: Rex Features  26 Lebanese people light candles at a vigil in Paris, France Credit: EPA  It had stopped due to âa malfunctionâ in Beirut where sailors were forced to stay on board to ensure its safety.  Sailors protested that Grechushkin claimed he had gone bankrupt and had ""abandoned the ship"" - going on hunger strike before finally being allowed to go ashore.  Grechushkin was said to have paid a âhuge penaltyâ for transporting the cargo without authority which led to him going bust - later moving to Cyprus with his wife Irina.  Neither the businessman nor his family have yet commented on the explosion, which had one fifth the power of a nuclear bomb.  The Russian captain of the ship Boris Prokoshev, now 70, warned at the time of the deadly nature of the cargo.  He said: âThe vesselâs owner abandoned it and we were abandoned too.  26 Emercom (Russian Emergency Situations Ministry) erect a camp for rescuers Credit: Getty Images - Getty  26 Rescue teams from around the world are heading to Beirut Credit: Getty Images - Getty  26 The explosion was heard 110 miles away in Cyprus Credit: AFP or licensors  26 Volunteers remove dirt and broken glass from a car Credit: AFP or licensors  ""We were living on a powder keg for ten months without being paid.""  Reportedly the blast was sparked when a reckless welder caused a fire at nearby Warehouse 9 - which then spread to the explosive Warehouse 12.  President Michel Aoun said the government was ""determined to investigate and expose what happened as soon as possible, to hold the responsible and the negligent accountable"".  Sources close to the investigation blamed the incident on ""inaction and negligence"", saying ""nothing was done"" by committees and judges involved in removing the explosives.  The cabinet ordered port officials involved in storing or guarding the material since 2014 to be put under house arrest.  Public Works Minister Michel Najjar told Al Jazeera he had only found out about the presence of the explosive material stashed at the port 11 days before the explosion.  26 Tuesday's chemical blast has left scenes of utter devastation Credit: AP:Associated Press  26 A restaurant destroyed after the massive explosion shook the Mar Mikhael district Credit: Alamy Live News  26 The monstrous explosion devastated the city's bustling port Credit: EPA  26 The side of this building was blown off in the tragedy Credit: AP:Associated Press  ""No minister knows what's in the hangars or containers, and it's not my job to know,"" he said.  The minister claimed he followed up on the matter but his work was then delayed by coronavirus lockdowns.  Najjar said he eventually spoke the general manager of the port on Monday - the day before the blast.  He said he asked him to send him all the relevant documentation, so that he could ""look into this matter.""  Najjar said he learned on Wednesday that his ministry had sent at least 18 letters to the Beirut urgent matters judge since 2014, asking for the goods to be disposed of.  ""The judiciary didn't do anything,"" he said. ""It's negligence.""  Badri Daher, Director General of Lebanese Customs, told broadcaster LBCI that customs had sent six documents to the judiciary warning that the material posed a danger.  He said: ""We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why.""  Another source close to a port employee said a team that inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago warned that if it was not moved it would ""blow up all of Beirut"".  What is ammonium nitrate? Ammonium nitrate is a chemical compound which is predominantly used in agriculture as a fertiliser - ut is also higling explosive. It is a white crystalline solid and is highly soluble in water - with the chemical formula NHâNOâ. The chemical is applied in granule form into the soil and quickly dissolves under moisture, allowing nitrogen to be released. Another use of ammonium nitrate is in the food industry where it is used as a nutrient in producing antibiotics and yeast. In most countries, it is used to make explosives for mining, quarrying and civil construction because of its low cost and ready availability. It has been the cause of numerous industrial explosions over the last three decades, including the explosion at a chemical plant in Toulouse, France, in 2001 that killed 31 people. Ammonium nitrate was also used to create the explosives used in the 2006 Mumbai train bombings. By itself, ammonium nitrate is not regarded as dangerous but under certain conditions, it can become deadly. The chemical is classified as an âenergetic materialâ meaning that it produces heat as it decomposes. If there is a significant amount of ammonium nitrate it can generate enough heat to catch fire and continue to burn eventually causing an explosion.  Two documents revealed that Lebanese Customs had asked the judiciary in 2016 and 2017 to ask the ""concerned maritime agency"" to re-export or approve the sale of the ammonium nitrate.  One of the documents cited similar requests in 2014 and 2015 - suggesting repeated warnings about the danger were overlooked by the authorities.  Prime Minister Hassan Diab vowed those responsible will ""pay the price"" as rescue operations continue in Beirut.  International aid is being mobilised across the world to help support the victims and search for those potentially still trapped beneath the rubble.  The US, UK, France, Gulf states and even rivals Israel have offered money and assistance, as President Aoun declared three days of mourning and announced he would release Â£50m of emergency funds.  Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the Lebanese prime minister told him there would be a ""full, thorough and rigorous investigation"" to get to the truth.  Mr Raab said: ""I think the people of the Lebanon deserve no less - and that there will be full accountability.""  He added the the details of Brits caught up in the Beirut blast was still being established - with a number known to have been injured.  HMS Enterprise will carry out survey work in the port to establish the extent of the damage.  British engineering experts have found the blast was ""unquestionably"" one of the largest non-nuclear explosions ever to take place.  The team from the University of Sheffield has calculated the strength of the blast based on the videos and photographs of the catastrophe.  They believe the explosion was the equivalent of 1,000 to 1,500 tonnes of TNT.  Beirut's governor Marwan Aboud said as many as 300,000 people may have been left homeless with many buildings reduced to an uninhabitable mess of rubble and glass.  There are concerns of food shortages and unrest in the city, with the blast compounding anger stemming from a severe economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.  US Pentagon sources also described the blast as a tragic accident - after President Donald Trump said he believed it was caused by âa bomb"".

In the latest set of figures from NHS Test and Trace out today, it showed a gradual trickling up of the cases picked up over the past week as more people got swabbed for the virus.  3 Cases are starting to increase again in the UK  3 However, that's partly due to the number of people being tested increasing too  It is partially thanks to a gradual uptick in the number of people being tested overall - up by four per cent in the last week.  More than 160,000 people were tested positive for the virus yesterday.  The latest data also showed thousands of potential carriers of the virus have still not gone into self-isolation because they were unable to be reached.  Of those transferred over to the new tracing system, 79 per cent were reached and asked to provide their contacts.  19,150 people were identified as coming into close contact with them - and 72 per cent were reached and asked to self isoalte.  The Government says the decrease of down to the reduction in contacts relating to local outbreaks.  The data covers the week up to the 29 July - and came just before Boris Johnson imposed local lockdowns on Manchester and parts of West Yorkshire and East Lancashire.  Matt Hancock hailed the latest figures which showed 97 per cent of face-to-face test results came back within 24 hours.  It came as politicians warned today that the trace system wasn't working because people don't want to pick up the phone to unknown numbers.  The Local Government Association warned people are missing from the databases because of the ""unrecognisable"" 0300 numbers - often associated with irritating cold callers.  Yesterday ministers were told the tracing system needs to radically improve before schools reopen again next month.  If the low numbers of contact tracing continue, it could result in another peak in December.  The crisis could be avoided, however â with pubs remaining open and no draconian lockdowns needed â if testing is ramped up and the track and trace system is improved.  The study says reopening schools must therefore be combined with a high-coverage test-trace-isolate strategy.

However, this preliminary opinion by Advocate General Michal Bobek is not binding and the rest of the court sided with German prosecutors, it has been reported.  The rape happened in 2005, two years before Madeleine disappeared while holidaying with her family in the same resort.  Christian B, 43, was convicted and sentenced for her rape in December 2019 - 14 years after the brutal attack which devastated her so much she fled to the US.  Meanwhile, the McCann apartment in Praia da Luz was the ""prime location"" for crime, police told Madeleine's distraught parents after she was abducted.

At least 60 people in two provinces in Eastern China have been infected with the newly emerging bug, thought to be passed via tick bites.  2 The virus is passed through tick bites Credit: Getty - Contributor  2 At least 60 people have been infected and seven people have died from the disease Credit: Getty Images - Getty  Around 27 people have fallen ill with the bug in Anhui Province, with seven deaths and a further 37 in Jiangsu Province, reports the countryâs state-run Global Times.  The actual virus, known as SFTS or Huaiyangshan banyangvirus, is not new - Chinese scientists isolated the pathogen in 2011.  But the disease - part of the Bunyavirus category - could pass between humans too, scientists warned.  The bug can travel from human to human through infected blood and mucus, said Sheng Jifang, a doctor from the first affiliated hospital under Zhejiang University.  WHAT IS SFTS VIRUS? SFTS or Huaiyangshan banyangvirus is an emerging infectious tick-borne disease that is part of the Bunyavirus category. It was first discovered in Easter China, but has also been found in Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and Taiwan. The symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, multiple organ failure, thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), leukopenia (low white blood cell count) and elevated liver enzyme levels. The disease has a mortality rate of between 12 and 30 per cent.

Harry Kane is a better bet for the Red Devils as they have a number of players similar to Sancho, the former midfielder reckons.  2 England teammates Jadon Sancho and Harry Kane have both been linked with United over the years  2 Paul Scholes, 45, wants to see Sancho at Old Trafford but believes Kane is a stronger shout Credit: PA:Press Association  United are plotting a Â£108million move for the Borussia Dortmund winger having reportedly agreed personal terms.  Sancho bagged 20 goals and 20 assists in 2019/20 but Kane would represent an option United do not currently have, says Scholes.  The 11-time Premier League winner told BT Sport: ""Donât get me wrong, Sancho is a top-quality footballer, I think he would improve any team in world football.  ""His stats say that he is a goalscorer, he will make and score lots of goals.  ""I just think we already have three forwards or wide men that are very similar to Sancho, possibly not quite as good as him, but potentially I think they could be.  âI think if that is Harry Kane you are talking about, I would be more desperate to sign him than Sancho at this stage.  ""I just think United need a centre forward, a real No9, a real goalscorer, and Kane would be that man for me.""  Scholes' warning follows a similar suggestion by Sir Alex Ferguson's former assistant Rene Meulensteen.  A move for Tottenham star Kane, who has claimed in the past he would leave North London if the team was going backwards, also makes more sense for the Dutchman.  Meulensteen told talkSPORT: ""Theyâre bringing Jadon Sancho in, but more than anything, I would have gone for a more prolific out-and-out striker, somebody like Harry Kane.  ""There is so much creativity coming from midfield with [Bruno] Fernandes, [Paul] Pogba, [Marcus] Rashford, [Anthony] Martialâ¦ they can all contribute to goalscoring.  ""But [they need] somebody in the middle whoâs going to score 25-plus goals. That will close the gap for United.""

Salford has dropped from being in the second spot last week down to fourth this week, while Wigan has moved up into number five from ninth last week.  Experts behind the app say that so far their predictions have been accurate having pinpointed Salford, Bolton, Blackburn and Darwen, Calderdale and Kirklees a week before the government identified them as areas of concern.  Targeted areas  Tim Spector, professor at King's College London who is leading the app study, said: âWe are really pleased to see that our Watch List is accurately identifying the areas of concern.  ""We created it so that the government can do targeted testing and use solid data to lead decisions about local lockdowns and extra precautions.""  The app, which has 3.5 million users, relies on people logging their symptoms on a regular basis and reporting results of Covid tests.  5 This heat map shows the estimated rate of symptomatic Covid cases in the UK  5 This chart shows the estimate of people with Covid across different regions since mid July  Prof Spector added: ""We urge people to continue logging in the app and encourage others as itâs their data that allows us to find out about the situation in their local area.  ""We want to avoid another nationwide lockdown, so obtaining good local data is crucial.""  Latest app figures also show that there were an average of 1,626 daily new cases of Covid in the UK over the fortnight up to August 1, excluding care homes.  The numbers are based on data from 12,092 swab tests done between July 19 and August 1.  Stable cases  Meanwhile, the latest estimated prevalence figures show that 26,512 people currently have symptomatic Covid in the UK.  It also suggests that over the last few weeks, the amount of symptomatic Covid nationally has remained stable, although is still higher than in early July.  The numbers are still higher in the North of England but the numbers have slightly decreased since last week.  These figures remain in line with the latest data from the smaller survey by the Office for National Statistics which estimated 35,700 people in England were infected with Covid in the week July 20 to July 26.  5 A Covid-19 testing centre at Bradford University in West Yorkshire - one of the areas where new measures have been implemented to prevent the spread of coronavirus Credit: PA:Press Association  It comes as a separate report found coronavirus infection rates continued to decline even when some lockdown restrictions had been lifted.  The research, conducted by Imperial College London and Ipsos MORI, involved 150,000 volunteers across England being tested for Covid-19 between June 19 and July 8 to determine the scope of the spread of the virus throughout the country.  An initial report from the study, released last month, found that the rate of infection throughout the country was halving every eight to nine days during May.  The study's second report has now revealed there was further decline of infection in late June and early July, with the virus continuing to halve every eight to nine days during this period before ultimately falling to just under eight positive cases per 10,000 people.  5 Health Secretary Matt Hancock has welcomed new research which found that coronavirus infection rates continued to decline even when some lockdown restrictions had been lifted  This was despite the reopening of non-essential shops and restrictions being eased to allow the public to have more interaction with people outside their households.  In contrast to the first report, the second report also showed there were no significant differences between the rates of infection for key workers and non-key workers.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock said this demonstrates the effectiveness of the country's infection control measures in limiting the spread of the virus in care homes and hospitals as well as the wider community.  I urge everyone to get a test if you have symptoms, self-isolate and provide your contacts to NHS Test and Trace Matt Hancock  He said: ""This research highlights how, thanks to everyone's efforts and sacrifice, alongside targeted measures to counter the spread of this virus in health and care settings, we were able to keep rates of infection low as some restrictions were lifted.  ""However, we must not be complacent. I urge everyone to get a test if you have symptoms, self-isolate and provide your contacts to NHS Test and Trace so we can continue to keep the virus at bay and get back to normal.""

In a recorded Zoom meeting seen by the Daily Telegraph, Dr Bousted told members they can't ""trust"" the Government advice and local areas should make their own rules.  She said: âThe latest iteration of government guidance is so unworkable that you can't trust it. Local authorities and schools should take the confidence to do what they can do and that will mean for many schools that they cannot have all children fully back in September.  âNow, the Government's making threatening noises about that. But in the end, they won't be able to carry out their threats.â  All schools ""should have the confidence to be looking at what is possible in your area and make those arrangements"".  It comes as a poll revealed that nine out of ten parents back the full reopening of schools next month.  The Office for National Statistics found 88 per cent of parents were âveryâ or âfairly likelyâ to return their child to class.  But yesterday, Schools Minister Nick Gibb admitted that the Government won't have the powers to force them to open.  He said that ""all children will be returning to school in September"" including those in the lockdown areas of Manchester, Leicester and other parts of England.  Mr Gibb added: ""But you can't decree this for every single case and it will depend on the circumstances of a local increase in the infection rate, and that is why it is being led by the director of public health in localities. But we want all children back in school.""  The Department for Education said that getting all kids back into the classroom was a ""national priority"".  One source said: âThere is absolutely no reason for schools to stay closed.

Ophelia, following the death of her mother, travels to his home in Donegal to profess her love for him.  When she arrives at his house in Knockdara, she discovers that Michael's wife, Roisin, recently died in a fire at their house â on the same night that he had told her about their affair.

County Donegal borders the Atlantic Ocean in northwestern Ireland.  It is largely made up of wild countryside, rugged coastlines, castles, and mountains.  Donegal is often referred to as ""The Forgotten County"" as it is remote and difficult to access, making it the perfect setting for a psychological drama.  Belfast  8 Filming for the show began in Belfast Credit: Getty - Contributor  It is yet unclear what part Belfast plays in the drama, but filming for the show started there.  The trailer shows Normal People actor Paul Mescal's character Sean driving Ophelia, so perhaps he takes her from Belfast to Donegal.

There were rumours AJ had been ""knocked out"" in sparring before that night which his team denied.  But Joshua regrouped, changed up his training camp and easily outpointed an out-of-shape Ruiz Jr in their December rematch.  Now Joshua's promoter Hearn is adamant the 30-year-old won't ""make that mistake again"".  Speaking to Sky Sports, the Matchroom boss said: ""Sparring wise? You need a tall, stand-up fighter who is technically sound.  ""Looking around? The likes of Dominic Breazeale, as an example. A stand-up heavyweight.  ""Pulev is very experienced, very good technically, punches a bit. You need to find a tall heavyweight that replicates that style.  ""Against Ruiz Jr the second time, they got their sparring spot on. That is so important moving forwards.""  Then, hinting that sparring in the lead-up to the shock defeat to Ruiz Jr wasn't quite right, Hearn added: ""He won't make that mistake again, of overlooking that element.  ""His sparring for Pulev will be spot on.""  Providing Joshua comes through the Pulev fight, it could set up two mouthwatering clashes against fellow Brit and WBC champ Tyson Fury.  The Gypsy King has his own bit of business to take care of first with the trilogy scrap against Deontay Wilder.

The Spanish winger, 20, had been with the La Liga club since the age of seven before Pep Guardiola forked out Â£20.8million to sign him on a five-year deal.  1 Manchester City new boy Ferran Torres has hit out at former club Valencia and Dani Parejo Credit: Getty Images - Getty  And while the Spaniard insisted he is ""excited and happy"" by the new challenge ahead of him, he remains hurt at how his time at Valencia ended.  In an interview with Marca, Torres revealed he put forward conditions to Valencia bigwigs to stay.  He wanted the club's billionaire owner Peter Lim to be involved with the talks so he knew he ""was important"".  The winger also wanted to be made captain and one of the club's highest earners - but none of the demands were met.  Mestalla skipper Dani Parejo came in the firing line with Torres claiming he was blamed for the bitter exit of former manager Marcelino.  The Spaniard said: ""After three years I'm more mature and mentally stronger. But at 17, no.  ""He [Parejo] is a great player but I never had a relationship with him.  ""When I joined the first team at 17, a number of weeks passed before he said a simple 'good morning' to me.  ""He wasn't a good captain with me.  ""The worst of it came after Marcelino's departure when [Lee] Kang-in and I were seen as culprits in the dressing room and they stopped talking to us for weeks.""  Torres scored six times and added seven assists in 44 appearances for Spanish side Valencia last season.  He claims his reputation at the La Liga outfit was tarnished by ""people within the club"" and ""bad journalists"".  But he hasn't ruled out eventually returning to his boyhood side.  When asked about the matter, he said: ""I'm sure I can. I refuse to think otherwise.  ""Even if there are crooked people. A lot of them won't be there in a few years and I'll have shown that I deserve to return.""  The 20-year-old is able to play on either wing and can also operate through the middle.

A study of 2,000 adults found we're increasingly turning to online tutorials to learn everything from poaching an egg to getting the job of our dreams.  2 Brits are finding love after watching 'how to date' videos online Credit: Alamy  2 We're increasingly turning to video tutorials to learn everything from poaching an egg to getting ready for a job interview Credit: Getty Images - Getty  And 10 per cent also think they landed their dream job after viewing clips about 'how to ace the perfect interview'.  A quarter of those polled even think they have been able to help someone in medical difficulty with knowledge gleaned from videos online.  And one in five believe this has meant they have helped to save a life.  The research was commissioned by Vision Direct, whose content manager Alex Smyrliadi, said: âWe all spend a lot of time online these days, and our attention spans are getting shorter and shorter.  ""How-to videos are always useful, but our study found they can actually be lifesaving, if the situation demands it.  âIt can be hard to learn something new when someone explains it just once, and as video content can be replayed whenever, wherever, it makes information a lot easier to digest.  ""Itâs almost second-nature to us as a format, as weâre all used to engaging with it through social media already.  âPlus, getting expert advice in person can be difficult or even impossible sometimes, so 'how to' videos make sharpening skills accessible to a lot more people.â  Previous research by Vision Direct found two-thirds of adults rely on technology first and foremost if they want to learn anything new.

But the most common skill Brits have picked up after watching videos online is how to tackle DIY jobs around the home.  In response to the survey findings, Vision Direct launched a series of How To Put In Contact Lenses videos, so those with a prescription can get additional online help when learning at home.  Mr Smyrliadi said: âAs with anything you learn yourself, just because youâre taught it in person doesnât mean you immediately pick it up and can then do that task perfectly first time around.  âWe know the old adage âpractice makes perfectâ stands true, and that to learn anything well, whether thatâs putting in contact lenses, doing a bit of DIY or poaching an egg, you need to do that thing more than once.

The Brazilian defender looks almost certain to leave the Ligue 1 side this summer and is said to have been particularly impressed by talks with the Gunners earlier this week.  1 Gabriel Magalhaes wants to move to Arsenal after being impressed by talks with the club  Mikel Arteta is keen on bringing a defender in to shore up his leaky back line.  And he looks set to land one in the coming weeks in the shape of the Â£27million rated 22-year-old, according to Get French Football News.  However, United will reportedly not give up on their pursuit with a deal to take him to Old Trafford said to be close yesterday.  Magalhaes' scintillating form in France has drawn admiring glances from across Europe, with Everton and Napoli also linked.  And he is almost certain to leave Lille this summer as a result, with the Ligue 1 club's owner Gerard Lopez admitting as much.  He recently told L'Equipe: ""With Gabriel, we are talking and weâve given him an exit pass. He will choose his club this week.â  The 6ft 3in defender made 34 appearances in the curtailed French 2019-20 season - including every minute of his side's Champions League campaign.  Arsenal's transfer business is under intense scrutiny after the club were hammered from all angles for making 55 members of staff redundant yesterday.  Mikel Arteta and most of his players took a 12.5 per cent pay cut in April which has since been reduced to five per cent after they qualified for Europe.  And the Gunners stars and club legend Ian Wright are said to be fuming with the decision.

The Leicester Jester began his love affair with the baize at Thorneâs snooker club in their hometown and was talent-spotted by brother Malcolm Thorne.  4 Willie Thorne, who died in June aged 66, was one of the sport's most popular players Credit: PA:Press Association  Thorne, who died in June aged 66, was present for Selbyâs first professional match against Wayne Brown at the 1999 British Open.  And the likeable but flawed snooker icon was at the Crucible, bawling his eyes out when Selby won his first of three world titles six years ago.  These are the first Betfred World Snooker Championship to take place since Thorneâs sad passing.  Thorne, who had well-documented drink and gambling issues, announced in March he had leukaemia and was receiving treatment in Spain before he died in lockdown.  Selby, 37, called: âWillie was a fun-loving, larger-than-life character.  âHe lit up a room whenever he walked in. He was always happy no matter what was going on in his life.  4 Mark Selby is aiming to win a fourth world snooker title at the Crucible Credit: Getty Images - Getty  âWe all know he had flaws. But we all have flaws in us. It doesnât make him any worse a person.  âHe had a massive influence on my career. I played at his club since I was 13 or 14 years old. His brother Malcolm sponsored me.  âIf it wasnât for Willie they wouldnât have probably had the club. I owe him a lot really. It was a sad day when I heard the news.  âHe was in hospital and then one of my close friends said that it could be hours not days. I got the news the next day. I was really cut up at the time. He was a massive part of my life.  âIf it wasnât for Willie and his family, I probably wouldnât be where I am today.  âDuring the 2014 World Championship, when I won it for the first time, he came in my dressing room every time before a session to see how I was feeling, if I was feeling relaxed.  4 Thorne won one major title but was known for his break-building skills Credit: News Group Newspapers Ltd  âHe gave me a few tips. He told me to go out there and enjoy it, play like youâre on the practice table.  âI still remember even when I picked up the trophy he was at the bottom of the table as he was commentating. He had tears in his eyes, he was crying, hugging my wife Vikki. Memories like that you always remember.â  In snooker there are trophies named after the late Paul Hunter and legends Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry, Ray Reardon and Alex Higgins.  Thorne only won one ranking event â the 1985 Classic in Warrington â so Selby reckons there should be a Memorial Day in his honour. Perhaps even a golf day with all the top names.  Selby was unable to get to the funeral in Spain and reckons the last time they spoke was at the Welsh Open in February.

Canary Islandsâ governors have intensified their campaign to persuade tourists to get on planes by becoming the first region to take out an insurance policy covering potential coronavirus-related costs.    The Canary Islands has been fighting for inclusion on a âsafeâ air corridor list along with the Balearic Islands so British tourists can be spared two weeks of quarantine when they return to the UK.  Spainâs Tourism Minister Maria Reyes Maroto has repeatedly called on Britain to give the countryâs holiday hotspots more leeway after a spike in new coronavirus cases in Catalonia and Aragon, insisting UK tourists on the Costas would be safer than at home.  The Canary Islandsâ Regional Tourism Minister Yaiza Castilla, announcing the insurance move, said: âWe have once again shown we are a leader when it comes to health security and taken another step in the fight against coronavirus.""  4 The islands have been placed back onto the UK ban list, following mainland Spain on July 26 Credit: Alamy Live News  4 Brits have been cancelling their holidays, with the new policy hoping to encourage them to eventually return Credit: AFP or licensors  âThe insurance policy weâve subscribed covers all tourists who come to our islands.  âIt means all holidaymakers, Spanish or foreign, can have any costs related to coronavirus covered, whether it be for medicines, repatriation or costs linked to any quarantine.  âItâs the result of an agreement with the multinational insurance specialist AXA.â  She added: âWe are the first autonomous community which will guarantee travel cover for Covid-19.  âWe believe this will definitely help the islandsâ economic recovery.â  The Canary Islands and Balearic Islands were initially excluded from the Foreign Officeâs advice against all but non-essential travel to Spain following the British governmentâs shock quarantine decision nearly a fortnight ago.  4 The islands, which include Tenerife and Lanzarote, rely on tourism and have slammed the UK government's decision Credit: AFP or licensors  But instead of putting in place the âsafeâ air corridors the two island regions and other holiday hotspots like the Costa Blanca and Costa del Sol were demanding because of their lower number of coronavirus cases, the UK stance was hardened and all of Spain declared a âriskâ area.  The quarantine decision led to a wave of cancellations by British holidaymakers.  Less than a third of the hotels in Magaluf and the neighbouring resort of Palmanova are open at the moment.  Mauricio Carballeda, president of the Palmanova-Magaluf Hotel Association, revealed last week: âOf the 88 hotels in Palmanova and Magaluf, only 33 are open or were going to open.  âNow, after the UK announced its quarantine for returning British tourists, two of those hotels will close and three have said they wonât open.  âThat leaves 28 hotels out of 88.

Demelza Jefferis was getting out of the shower when she noticed the mark on her cleavage.  6 Demelza Jefferis had been getting out of the shower when she noticed the mark Credit: Kennedy News and Media  At first, the 42-year-old dismissed it as a stretch mark but after looking again she realised it was a small dent that only appeared when her arm was raised.  Demelza, who lives in Plymouth, Devon, has a history of breast cancer in the family and said she has always been thorough with checking for abnormalities.  At the age of 58 her grandmother sadly died of breast cancer and Demelza believes her grandmother had been watching over her that day as she accidentally dropped her towel and spotted the cancer sign.  In order to inspect the mark, the mum-of-one relaxed her arm close to 100 times to inspect the small crease which appeared by her left nipple.  6 The dimple like mark can be seen above - above Demelza's nipple Credit: Kennedy News and Media  She then called her husband Gary, 42, to see if he could also see the mark.  Demelza then contacted her GP who referred her for mammograms and biopsies.  On April 21, a month after she noticed the dent - the tests confirmed that she has stage two breast cancer.  After successful treatment and getting the all-clear, she is now bravely sharing images of the dimple-like shape in the hope of making other women aware of the signs to look out for.  What are the symptoms of breast cancer in women? Breast cancer is the name given to any cancers that have first developed in the breast tissue â there are many different types. For most women, the first sign or symptom of breast cancer is a lump or area of thickened tissue in their breast. While 90 per cent of such lumps are not cancerous, it is vital to get them checked by your GP at the earliest opportunity â detecting the disease early can mean treatment is more effective. It is therefore vitally important to be ""breast aware"" - know what feels normal for you, and therefore what changes to look out for. One in three women do not regularly check their breasts, and a fifth of these women say it is because they don't know how to do it. What to look out for Redness or rash  Change in breast size or shape  Nipple discharge  Swelling in the armpit or around the collarbone  Change in skin texture  An inverted nipple  Constant pain  Demelza said: ""I've always looked at my boobs, checked and felt them.  ""I've always been amazed at how many people have actually said they would never think to check. It takes two minutes.  ""At this time, when I didn't actually look and feel, it was the time that something was actually there.  ""Someone was definitely looking over me that day, for sure. I'm a true believer in that - someone was looking over me and saying, 'we need to get you to have a look'. It's really uncanny how everything unfolded.â  6 Demelza has always checked her breasts and was shocked at the diagnoses Credit: Kennedy News and Media  She said that when the coronavirus lockdown first started she was more concerned that she would no longer be able to have her armpits waxed.  The day she got out of the shower she said she noticed how hairy her arm pits had become and thought to herself that she would have to try and find a home waxing kit.  She added: ""With that, I had my left arm up and my towel dropped. As my towel dropped, I went to grab it and I looked up in the mirror. The light was shining through the window, and I thought, 'oh, what's that?'.  ""I thought, having had kids, it was just a stretch mark. I thought it was a stretch mark for a split second, until I put my arm back up.  6 Demelza had to have surgery to remove the lump from her breast Credit: Kennedy News and Media  ""I was just like, 'no, that's definitely not a stretch mark' and I didn't like the look of it at all.  ""I put my arm up again to check. I must have done it a good 10 to 100 times because every time I put my arm up it was there, and every time I put it down, it wasn't there.  ""'Oh my days', I thought, 'what the hell is this?'. I shouted to my husband and told him that he needed to check both my boobs and tell me if he sees anything on them at all.â  She said Gary noticed the line and she asked him to point to it, so she knew they had both been looking at the same mark.  6 Demelza said she asked her husband Gary to also take a look at the mark Credit: Kennedy News and Media  ""I put my arms down, and he said it had gone; I put my arms up and he said it was there. I kept putting up and down, and we both checked, and he said, 'that's definitely not right'.""  Demelza had an MRI scan and then on May 18 she had an operation to remove the lump from her chest.  She said: ""I don't remember much of the consultation.. They were telling me the plan for treatment and I was just in tears.  ""I couldn't believe it was happening. I still can't get my head around the fact it's happened.  6 After the operation Demela was left with a small mark Credit: Kennedy News and Media  ""With Covid-19 and everything that's happened, it has been such a blur. It's just weird.  ""It's gone now, and it's done. I can build a bridge and get over it. But it was very overwhelming.â  Doctors removed the lump and a couple of lymph nodes from her armpit and sent them away for testing.  The results found that none of the lymph nodes had cancer present.  The doctor told Demelza that she was âlucky to have found what you didâ.  On July 31, after two weeks of radiotherapy, Demelza completed her treatment - just in time for her 16th wedding anniversary.  Most read in Fabulous WHY SO BLUE?

Adam, an LBC caller, shocked radio host James O'Brien when he revealed that his wife, a coronavirus contact tracer, has only managed to make two phone calls since the end of May and both were unsuccessful. The radio caller claimed the first phone call made by his wife was unanswered, while the second person called by her hung up after just 10 seconds. Shocked by the admission, the radio host asked: ""She's been doing the job since May, all day every day and she's made two phone calls? Since May?""  Trending  The caller replied: ""Yes, end of May I'd say she started."" Asked whether he believed this was an exceptional experience as others also told the radio show they had only made less than five calls in three months, Adam replied: ""No, and what's quite interesting is that when you log on there is an indication of how many users are on and it's usually around the 900 mark for other active users. ""Now, I don't know if that's separated geographically or if it's just overall. ""And then it says available calls and that is usually zero or perhaps the ones that do get called early on because people want to actually do it.

READ MORE: Piers Morgan hits out at 'shameful decision' in furious rant  Coronavirus contact tracers tell James O'Brien they made two calls in three months  Coronavirus contact tracers asked to do overtime despite lack of calls  The boss of outsourcing giant Serco has defended the fact that 10,000 contact tracers have only spoken to an average of 2.4 people each. Rupert Soames, chief executive of Serco, which is among several firms that are recruiting, coaching and managing contact tracers, admitted that the Test and Trace system has ""more capacity than we need"" but said the Government ""had to start somewhere"". Mr Soames also admitted that 20% of contacts are untraceable as individuals who tested positive do not know them well enough to have their personal details. His comments comes as an anonymous contact tracer said she is effectively being ""paid to watch Netflix"". NHS England's Test and Trace system, which is being led by Baroness Dido Harding, relies on identifying people who have been in contact with a positive case and getting them to self-isolate. But the programme, run by Serco and Sitel through a contract reported to be worth up to Â£108 million, has faced questions about performance and value for money.  Last month, health expert Professor Sir Chris Ham wrote an opinion piece in the British Medical Journal urging the Government to give local leaders control over the service. Mr Soames told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Test and Trace programme is ""improving all of the time"". ""I think we need to get this into proportion. You're giving me the numbers saying that we're tracing 50% of contacts, let me tell you that 96% of the people that we talk to agree to self-isolate. ""So we've got a very, very high success rate of people that we get to contact,"" he said. Pushed on the fact that this is only the known contacts that tracers have been able to reach, Mr Soames added: ""So there's been 218,000 already contacted."" Questioned again on why tracers are still only managing to get hold of half of people's contacts, Mr Soames said: ""If somebody rang you now and I said: 'Tell me everybody that you have met, been in contact with, in the last 48 hours, and tell me on the telephone, give me their contact details', how many do you think that you'd be able to reel off of the top of your head?

The cause of the blast is yet to be confirmed â but it has been linked to a warehouse at the city's port, close to populated areas, which was storing extremely dangerous explosive material. Lebanense officials are investigating exactly how the disaster happened, with the country's prime minister vowing that those responsible for an explosion at a ""dangerous"" warehouse would ""pay the price"". Hassan Diab said: ""I promise you that this catastrophe will not pass without accountability. Those responsible will pay the price.  Trending  ""Facts about this dangerous warehouse that has been there since 2014 will be announced and I will not preempt the investigations."" The blast's disastrous impact on the city of Beirut is evident, with foreign aid already arriving in an attempt to ease the pressure on health services in the city. Food stocks have been destroyed and between 250,000 - 300,000 people have been left homeless. The larger second blast is thought to have been caused by the detonation of more than 2,700 tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate that had been stored in a warehouse at the port since it was confiscated from a cargo ship in 2014.  Beirut explosion: London would have been damaged as far out as Wood Green  Beirut explosion: The site of the explosion in Lebanon's capital  The second of the two blasts could be heard in Cyprus, more than 100 miles away. Broken glass and debris was visible two miles away, encompassing an area where more than 750,000 people live. Damage was seen in a radius of up to six miles away from the port â a blast which would have had an equally devastating impact in some of the world's biggest cities. Had the blast occurred in Central London for example, this damage would have been felt as far as Stratford to the east, Wood Green to the north and Forest Hill (near Dulwich) to the south.

Critics of the scheme warn such a move could cause additional anxiety to vulnerable people as private bailiffs would have a greater role in collecting the money. Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, which has campaigned to protect free licences, said: âWe are aware that any decriminalisation of the TV licence enforcement process would in all likelihood lead to greater use of bailiffs to reclaim the money due and thatâs one of the reasons why we are wary of any such policy shift. âIt is hard to think of anything more distressing and frightening for an older person than to have a bailiff turn up at their front door, demanding entry.â  Over-75s are no longer entitled to free TV licences  The Governmentâs own consultation document states: âThe use of enforcement agents to enforce the debt may cause additional anxiety for individuals who may already be vulnerable.â In its submission to the consultation, the BBC warned civil enforcement would allow items to be seized and âsold by a bailiffâ.

Despite having a population of only 1.2 million, Cyprus appears to be risking a treaty that covers nearly 500 million consumers and 28 percent of the worldâs economy. It is the first EU country to reject such a deal, which has been provisionally in force since 2017.  Trending  The parliamentarians' reasons for opposing the EU's Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Ottawa (CETA) include concerns over labour rights and in particular, over insufficient legal protections for Cyprus's national cheese: halloumi. The island, which is split between Greek and Turkish sectors, would like their delicacy to get the same protected status as champagne and Parma ham. The cheese is a mixture of goat and sheep milk matured in brine. It is commonly used as a substitute for meat.  EU's status as trading force in QUESTION after Halloumi row over Canada trade deal  A spokesperson for the centre-left Movement for Social Democracy, one of the parties which opposed the deal, said: ""We request the registration of halloumi as a Protected Designation of Origin product from Cyprus as soon as possible, so that we can support the ratification of CETA."" The source added Brussels needed to ""handle the matter quickly and responsiblyâ. According to a report by POLITICO, EU officials in Brussels have been preparing for this eventuality for years and think they have included enough safeguards into the legal framework of trade deals to ensure that one country's national parliament cannot scupper the entire accord. Moreover, Brussels could also include protection for halloumi without reopening the deal.

According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), about 2,300 people in the US have died from the disease - and as the climate continues to warm, more cases will be found, experts have said.  As the name suggests, the virus, and the mosquitoes carrying it, originate from the Nile, in northern Africa, where conditions are much more warm and humid. However, climate scientists believe that as the US, particularly in the south west such as California, gets warmer, more cases will be discovered which will inevitably lead to more deaths from the disease which currently has no vaccine. A study from the University of California (UC) Berkeley analysed 2 million mosquitoes which had been captured across California between 2006 and 2016. All of the mosquitoes had been tested for West Nile virus, and then machine learning software cross-referenced whether the virus was present, and where the mosquitoes had been found.  West Nile Virus warning: California at risk of disease-carrying mosquito boom  The coast of California is expected to undergo noticeable warming in the coming decades  The team found that infection among captured mosquitoes was strongly associated with the average temperature in the neighbourhood, according to the research published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Nicholas Skaff, the lead author of the study and a former postdoctoral scholar in environmental health sciences at UC Berkeley's School of Public Health, said: ""Our data revealed a sharp transition, whereas temperatures shift between 70 to around 73 degrees Fahrenheitâthe likelihood of capturing infected mosquitoes in LA neighbourhoods increases dramatically. ""Above this range, conditions become consistently favourable for transmission, and below this range, conditions are consistently unfavourable."" The coast of California is expected to undergo noticeable warming in the coming decades, which could prove to be the perfect breeding ground for the disease-carrying mosquitoes, said Justin Remais, associate professor of environmental health sciences at UC Berkeley. READ MORE: Dengue fever alarm: Warning issued over NEW panic  ""If coastal Los Angeles experiences a month or two of warm temperatures during the summer or early fall, it's probably a good time to be extra careful to avoid mosquito bites""  He said: ""Coastal LA appears to be vulnerable to the expected warming of California's climate by mid-century, which will push coastal climates more consistently into the favourable zone. ""Inland LA may not be as susceptible to these shifts, as the climate is already favourable. ""Yet, as climate warming progresses towards the century's end, it is possible that temperatures become too hot in these areas."" Mr Skaff continued: ""Our research suggests that, rather than focusing on daily weather reports, it's important to examine temperatures over the long haul.

The German champions have been very open about Thiagoâs decision to request a transfer this summer, with the Spaniard eager for a new challenge â though there have been no formal offers for his services yet.  Liverpool were heavily linked with the 29-year-old, with early reports even suggesting personal terms had been agreed, but their interest appears to have waned.  Thiago is back in training ahead of the Champions League restarting (Picture: Getty)  Now German magazine Kicker report that both Thiago and Klopp are still eager for the move to happen, but it is Liverpoolâs hierarchy holding up the deal.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  While Klopp feels Thiagoâs passing ability and vision would add an important new facet into his mix of midfield options, others behind the scenes have questioned how he fits into the team and the sideâs high pressing, energetic style.  There are also concerns over the former Barcelona manâs injury record, with Thiago never having started more than 26 league games in a season in his entire career and having undergone groin surgery in June.  Kicker report that Fenway Sports Group, who own Liverpool, have also made it clear that no players can be brought in until funds are raised from sales.  Bayern are holding out for Â£32m but Liverpool would only value Thiago at around Â£18m given he has one year left on his contract, with Naby Keitaâs name proposed as someone Liverpool could potentially cash in on to fund the deal.  Klopp is unlikely to want to sacrifice Keita to land Thiago, though, with the former RB Leipzig man becoming increasingly influential after the season restarted.  Keita endured a number of injury setbacks during his first two years at Anfield (Picture: Getty)  Speaking after his excellent display against Brighton last month, Klopp said of Keita: âAbsolutely great.

Today, weâll finally see his appearance in The Rolling Stones music video for Scarlet, after a teaser was previously dangled in front of our noses like some delectable, charming, musical carrot.  A 10-second clip of Paul in various states of dress â from a tuxedo, bow-tie un-done, to a white tank and whisky glass in hand â was all we needed to pull us under.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Again.  Advertisement  Itâs a brilliant marketing ploy from the Stones I gotta say, to get the breakout actor of the year to front their latest single.  If there was a man who could channel the same kind of rockstar bravado needed to back the singing chops of Sir Mick Jagger in a music video, itâs Paul Mescal.  But, like some Homer Simpson meme descending into the bushes, Iâve been watching Paul and admiring his charming charm for the past few months and pardon my hyperbole but his BDE (aka Big Dick Energy) is what will save this year from the dumpster fire it has become.  Sure he was just a happy-go-lucky Irish (donât get that bit wrong) actor who was cast in the BBC series based on a book that everyone was obsessed with. Well, he was.  Now Paulâs become this Adonis of casual proportions, able to titillate the ladies while not threatening the fellas. That classic and clichÃ©d mix of âyou either want to be with them or be best friends with themâ.  He can get about in a pair of white GAA shorts, with a couple of tins of gin in one hand (pink gin, because there is no toxic masculinity up in here), and a packet of prawn crisps in the other like itâs no big deal.  Even though, to us, it is a very big deal.  The energy in this image is making us emotional (Picture: Clicknews & media)  He can appear in countless TV interviews alongside his co-star, Daisy Edgar-Jones â who, may I add, is equally deserving of all the Normal People praise â answer the same questions over and over again, and yet have you hanging on every velvet word.  Paul can appear to reject the idea of fame and shirk away from the attention, but not make it seem like we were weird for fawning over him in the first place. Even though this level of worldwide thirst has to be baffling to be on the receiving end of.  This palaver all began earlier this year when we lost our pants at his portrayal of Connell in Normal People, right as this heinous pandemic first kicked off.  Weâd binged Tiger King and with no chance of seeing the outside world for months to come, the next thing we turned our attention to was Normal People. We watched an accumulative 42 minutes of Paul and Daisy do it with full frontal and wild abandon, and yet we feel we can still look them in the eye.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Thereâs the first whiff of Paulâs BDE.  When we were first introduced to the BDE (Picture: BBC)  Then thereâs the chain. Yes, THE chain.  That delicate piece of silver, winding its way around Connellâs clavicle that essentially broke us yet, strangely, kept us together at the same time.  Even after the show, Paul was seen wearing the chain before one was sold at auction. For Â£62,000 â evidently also showing us we need to reassess our priorities if we so easily lose it over a stinkinâ chain. But, hey, we are in a global pandemic and these are the things we hold so dear right now.  When it comes to charity, heâs also not only had a laugh at the fact his sweaty chain was sold for a stupid amount of money, but he also read childrenâs books all in the name of raising more funds.  Then thereâs his social media.  While most celebrities use it as some sort of promotional mouthpiece, and more power to them, the way Paul swings his BDE over his accounts is just so G-damn wholesome. If having BDE can also be wholesome.  In the last week heâs been called âBritishâ by an awards season press that didnât seem to know Irish is not British, and he had no issue in correcting them in a simple two-word tweet.  IÃ¢ÂÂm Irish. â Paul Mescal (@mescal_paul) July 29, 2020  And, thus, there went the worldâs pants again.  Last month he was nominated for an Emmy. Well-deserved. In another act of BDE-ness, he also made no secret of his annoyance that co-star Daisy, who played Marianne, was not. Which, as weâll concur, is a bloody outrage.  Advertisement  Now weâre about to go gaga for todayâs video clip.  In it, Paul portrays this party boy who plays the rock tune in a swanky Claridgesâ hotel suite. Hold onto your pants. Again.  From the chain to the charm, he is a man of the people on so many levels, and if you donât believe that screams to his raging BDE then Iâm afraid you have no soul.  With the actor having also made his first post-Normal People project in series The Deceived, old mate has somehow managed to ride the train well away from his breakout BBC character, while not abandoning it altogether, and is now officially in the land of the bona fide BDE club.  And, honestly, weâre all the better for it.  Do you have a story youâd like to share? Get in touch by emailing platform@metro.co.uk  Share your views in the comments below.

Hiroshima mayor Kazumi Matsui used a speech today to take aim at the âhypocrisyâ of Japanâs government hosting 50,000 American troops and protected by the US nuclear umbrella.  In what survivors and pacifists call âinsincereâ, Tokyo has not signed the nuclear weapons ban treaty adopted in 2017, despite its non-nuclear pledge.  Mr Matsui said: âI ask the Japanese government to heed the appeal of the (bombing survivors) to sign, ratify and become a party to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  âAs the only nation to suffer a nuclear attack, Japan must persuade the global public to unite with the spirit of Hiroshima.â  The US dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, on August 9, 1945, destroying the city and killing 140,000 people, including many children.  Three days later, the US dropped a second bomb on Nagasaki, killing a further 70,000 people. Japan surrendered on August 15, ending the Second World War.  Survivors, their families and other participants commemorated the anniversary of the tragedy with a minute of silence on Thursday. The ceremony at Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park was scaled down, with the number of attendants reduced to fewer than 1,000 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The survivors â who have an average age of 83 â said they were regretful of the slow progress of nuclear disarmament. They today expressed anger over what they said was reluctance from the government to help and listen to those who have suffered.  Keiki Ogura, 84, who survived the bomb at the age of 8, said: âMany survivors are offended by the prime minister of this country who does not sign the nuclear weapons prohibition treaty, we need non-nuclear states to help us and pressure the Japanese government into signing.â  Mayor Matsui urged world leaders to visit Hiroshima and see the reality of the atomic bomb, especially leaders from nuclear weapons states.

Thatâs the message from a team of researchers who believe this will worsen racial inequality over time.  University of Cambridge experts suggest current portrayals and stereotypes about AI risk creating a âracially homogeneousâ workforce of aspiring technologists, creating machines with bias baked into their algorithms.  The scientists say cultural depictions of AI as white need to be challenged, as they do not offer a âpost-racialâ future but rather one from which people of colour are simply erased.  Advertisement  According to the researchers from Cambridgeâs Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence (CFI), like other science fiction tropes, AI has always reflected racial thinking in society.  Advertisement  Advertisement  In the study published in the Philosophy and Technology journal, they argue there is a long tradition of racial stereotypes when it comes to extraterrestrials â from the âorientalisedâ alien of Flash Gordonâs Ming the Merciless to the Caribbean caricature of Star Warsâ Jar Jar Binks.  Researchers argue the âwhitenessâ of AI will create a âracially homogeneousâ workforce of aspiring technologists (Credits: Getty Images/iStockphoto)  However, AI is portrayed as white because unlike species from other planets, it has attributes used to âjustify colonialism and segregationâ in the past, the researchers suggest.  Dr Kanta Dihal, who leads CFIâs Decolonising AI initiative, said: âGiven that society has, for centuries, promoted the association of intelligence with white Europeans, it is to be expected that when this culture is asked to imagine an intelligent machine, it imagines a white machine.  âPeople trust AI to make decisions. Cultural depictions foster the idea that AI is less fallible than humans.  âIn cases where these systems are racialised as white, that could have dangerous consequences for humans that are not.â  The experts looked at recent research from a range of fields, including Human-Computer Interaction and Critical Race Theory, to demonstrate that machines can be racialised, and that this perpetuates âreal worldâ racial biases.  This includes work on how robots are seen to have distinct racial identities, with black robots receiving more online abuse, and a study showing that people feel closer to virtual agents when they perceive shared racial identity.  Dr Dihal said: âOne of the most common interactions with AI technology is through virtual assistants in devices such as smartphones, which talk in standard white middle-class English.  âIdeas of adding black dialects have been dismissed as too controversial or outside the target market.â  The researchers conducted their own investigation into search engines, and found that all non-abstract results for AI had either Caucasian features or were the colour white.  Co-author of the paper, Dr Stephen Cave, executive director of CFI, said: âStock imagery for AI distils the visualisations of intelligent machines in western popular culture as it has developed over decades.  Fictional depictions of AI have often been played by white actors (Credits: Dna/Kobal/REX)  âFrom Terminator to Blade Runner, Metropolis to Ex Machina, all are played by white actors or are visibly white onscreen.  âAndroids of metal or plastic are given white features, such as in I, Robot. Even disembodied AI â from HAL-9000 to Samantha in Her â have white voices.  Advertisement  Advertisement  âOnly very recently have a few TV shows, such as Westworld, used AI characters with a mix of skin tones.â  Dr Dihal added: âAI is often depicted as outsmarting and surpassing humanity.  âWhite culture canât imagine being taken over by superior beings resembling races it has historically framed as inferior.  âImages of AI are not generic representations of human â like machines â their whiteness is a proxy for their status and potential.â  Westworld is one example of a TV show with AI represented through different skin tones (Credits: Bad Robot/Kobal/REX)  Dr Dihal concluded: âThe perceived whiteness of AI will make it more difficult for people of colour to advance in the field.  âIf the developer demographic does not diversify, AI stands to exacerbate racial inequality.â",https://metro.co.uk/2020/08/06/cambridge-university-says-whiteness-13092556/,https://metro.co.uk/feed/,ddc15248c5e85b86adeeaa8e5a28635d6e945e9991b035d55238a4defee661ea,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Aimee Osbourne literally moved out of the family home in order to avoid sharing her life with the world, much to the dismay of Ozzy, Sharon, Kelly and Jack.  And while the musician has been a bit more open with the public thanks to her career as a singer, Aimee admitted her love of privacy helped to dictate her choices back in the early noughties.  Speaking about her choice to stay off-camera, she told New Yorkâs Q1043 Out of the Box show: âFor me, I had grown up around having a pretty well-known dad anyway, and â¦ I always really valued my privacy within that family.

But Sharon previously admitted it broke her heart when Aimee chose to leave their home aged just 16.  She explained on The Talk: âI know that my eldest girl, AimÃ©e, left home at 16 and she couldnât live in our house because we were filming and it drove her insane.  âShe felt too that she didnât want to grow up on camera. She hated the idea â it was appalling to her. And so she left at 16 and I regret every day that she did.â  Sharon added: âShe was happy, but it broke my heart when she moved.â  Got A Showbiz Story?

Known as AH, the boy died in a hospice last year following a cardiac arrest three weeks after the accident at home in Norfolk.  The tragedy, on April 3, 2019, took place while AH and three of his five siblings were at home.  Details of his death were revealed after a serious case review by the Norfolk Safeguarding Children Partnership (NSCP).

Advertisement  Advertisement  The second stair gate â installed due to concerns about one of the children climbing on the upstairs windowsill â was described as âunsafeâ, with âthe children climbing over itâ and âtrying to force it openâ.  The NSCP has called on child protection agencies to review and evaluate guidance on the safe use of stair gates.  Agencies said that âused in the right circumstances, there is no doubt that stair gates save livesâ.  The boy was found trapped in the gap between the original stairgate and one added to prevent children climbing over the lower one (Picture: Getty/iStockphoto)  The report found a number of âconcerns about neglectâ were known about by agencies during child AH and their siblingsâ lives. The familyâs other children have now gone into foster care or are being looked after by the council.  Police who answered the 999-call said that the children lived in a âsocially deprived areaâ in âabsolute squalorâ. The report described the childâs house â where he lived between January and April 2019 â as âcluttered with an unpleasant odourâ.  AH was âreported to have worn the same clothes all weekâ¦.he was not toilet trained and not always cleaned after soiling his nappyâ the report found. It also stated there was âoften no food in the houseâ and children were left in dirty nappies and âsoreâ.  The report stated that the children were âhappy, lively and resilientâ with a âwarm relationship with their mother who clearly loved them very much and took a pride in their achievementsâ.  It found that AHâs mother was âoverwhelmed by [the] demands of a big family, a low income and no friends or family supportâ.  Chris Robson, NSCP chairman, said: âThis was a tragic accident and the thoughts of the whole partnership are with AHâs family and friends.  âAHâs mother was seeking to protect him by installing these gates and there is no doubt that she loved her children very much. The review recommends multi-agency work to review the published risks of using stair gates so that parents and carers know when and how to use them safely.  âDespite the absolute tragedy of AHâs death, I would not want to deter anyone from installing a gate to stop small children from accessing the stairs.  âUsed in the right circumstances, there is no doubt that stair gates save lives.â  Advertisement  Advertisement  The review was commissioned to look at how well agencies worked together to identify any safeguarding practices that could be improved. Six recommendations were made, including reviewing neglect risk assessment tools and training on isolation and depression.

Saag Jaan, 21, from California, was previously in an arranged engagement but it ended before the wedding and she wanted to share some of the things she learned.  She told Metro.co.uk: âI was arranged in an engagement when I was 19 years old, but that ended due to irreconcilable differences because of my lack of commitment, educational ambitions and personal values.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  âI included what I thought was important all from personal experience.â  Saag's thread in full DONT GET MARRIED BEFORE: a thread 1. Talk about DEBT  2. FULLY and WILLINGLY committing to one another. No âim not sureâ and âwhat ifâsâ and âits not the right time.â you are either in or youâre OUT. 3. When/how many kids yall want (adoption? are one of you infertile? etc.) 4. Talking about STDs. Get checked. Seek medical help/informed professional knowledge. Keep those tests up to date and find ways to do so even within the marriage. 5. Talk about your 5-10 year timeline regarding career/education. Can you move? Willingness to relocate? etc. 6. Levels of religiosity. Openness to growth? Lack Thereof? Do you share fundamental CORE beliefs about life? VERY important. 7. Anger managements issues: do one of you struggle? Are you in therapy for it/taking it out on others? Seek help, bc it will destruct you and the future and the childrenâ¦. 8. Energy. Does it match? you decide. Follow your gut 9. CLOTHING: it may seem like a small problem but small things eventually ADD up. Make sure your expectations MATCH one another to full comfort 10. Sexual compatibility. Not going to go into details, but yall need to be on the same playing field. Consent wise, willingness to try things, traumas, etcâ¦ figure it out. 11. Finances: how do you intend on splitting bills? Gender roles? Taking the parents in during old age? etc. 12. Age doesnât matter too much. In my experience itâs about the person & what their world views are. If you are young, make sure the person youâre with will allow you to keep growing at your own pace and in your own way. Itâs called respect. 13. Opposite gender boundaries. Set whatâs okay. Whatâs not okay. Hugs/handshakes/etc. I know it sounds tribal & trust should be there but youâd be surprised what peopleâs boundaries are. Better to know than not know 14. Social media: believe it or not, people WILL break up over this. Some prefer privacy. Some not. Get on the same page or youâll be clowning on one another. 15. I mentioned this before, but SAVINGS. How much do yâall have earned & combined? How much is your intended salaries? Is it sustainable? Apartment? House? Condos? Etc. speak futuristically if itâs not smthing u can afford right now. Get on the same page. 16. What is cheating? Entanglements? Define your breaks? Breakups? Etc. 17. Physical and verbal abuse: what is and isnât considered abusive language and decorum? Seek help, please. Professionals can always step in. 18. What are your dying wishes? Burial proceedings? What if one of you becomes paralyzed? God parents? Uncertain events? Death? Speak it. Speak on all of it. 19. Importantly, LOVE is not what keeps relationships going. An active commitment to LOVE, despite the downfalls, keeps it going. Get out the princess-king happily ever after mindset and youâll be fine 20. I want everyone to notice how I failed to mention level of education, family or tribal background, ethnicity, job level, & all. Itâs because none of this matters in the long run. Trust. you ainât a good person based off superficial attributes.  Saag covers everything from money to ethics to STDs and your five to 10 year career plan.

The former 205 Live general manager and 24/7 Champion was one of many superstars released back in April as part of cuts made due to the coronavirus pandemic, but a groundswell of online support led to him being rehired after the Cruiserweight Championship Tournament.  Although Maverick lost in the final, the show ended on a high note when NXT boss Triple H came out onto the stage and handed him his new contract live on air.  Fans suspected this was part of the act and that the Birmingham-born star knew in advance â but he insisted this isnât the case.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  Asked when he found out he was being re-signed, Drake exclusively told Metro.co.uk: âWhen he walked out was the moment. [But] the suspicions I had were after the KUSHIDA match.  âRemember, it was only supposed to be three matches so I assumed Iâd do the preliminary bracket and thatâd be it. Then the KUSHIDA match, and they were like âItâs a triple threatâ â I go, well maybe they just want me to have one more.  âOh OK, maybe one more. Then the Fantasma match, itâs like, âHeâs up todayâ â ah. Well, thank you â I didnât have three matches, I had five. Whatever you need me to do, Iâm going to be a complete professional.  âMy professionalism and integrity in my own brand was more important than anything during that whole thing.â  Drake impressed fans and his bosses (Photo: WWE)  In the end, those five matches were enough to impress the top bosses and give the 37-year-old wrestler a real chance to revitalise his career.  The movement for Drake to get his job back came after he posted an emotional â and very real â video addressing his release on social media.  âIf I lose a match Iâm probably done, so hereâs James everyone. You havenât seen me in a ring, but I promise youâll have everything you have,â he said as he reflected on the clip.  âGetting a little choked up there.

Iâm like, if that storyline was my life Iâm glad you were entertained, but it wasnât fun being that guy.â  Despite the tough situation, the happy ending is enough for Maverick to reflect fondly on the experience, and the way it played out for fans on television.  âA really lovely moment at a time, I think, the world needed one,â he pondered, referring to the current pandemic. âIf it was just like, heâs gone, there is no hope.

Following a decision branded âa huge win for natureâ, questions now loom over whether to reintroduce more of the animals â hailed for bringing a range of benefits to the local areas â across England.  As many as 15 family groups in Devon can now swim, build dams and breed on the river and its tributaries without fears of being put into captivity â four centuries after the mammals were thought to have been hunted to extinction in Britain. Conservationists say the origins of the beavers on the River Otter are unclear, but reports of the semi-aquatic mammals living wild on the waterway started in around 2006.  To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video  By 2013, video evidence of beaver young, or kits, showed the animals were successfully breeding.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  Officials intended to catch the beavers and put them into captivity, but Devon Wildlife Trust put forward plans for a five-year trial monitoring them in the wild, with the support of local people.  The Trust applied for a licence for the trial from government agency Natural England in 2014, and, after four adults and a kit were captured, tested and found to be clear of disease in 2015, they were released back on to the river.  DNA tests had also confirmed they were Eurasian beavers, a species found in the UK before being hunted to extinction several hundred years ago, rather than North American beavers â but also that they were inbred.  Then a new pair of beavers were released into the area in 2016 to boost the populationâs genetic diversity, before a further two beavers were released into different parts of the river in May 2019.  As many as 15 family groups are now thought to be living along the river in Devon (Picture: Devon Wildlife Trust)  The five-year River Otter Beaver Project, a partnership led by Devon Wildlife Trust and involving Clinton Devon Estates, Derek Gow Consultancy and the University of Exeter, measured the impact of the animals on the local landscape, economy, communities and wildlife.  A report on the trial, published earlier this year, revealed a range of benefits, including reducing the risk of flooding for downstream properties, and benefiting wildlife including fish, water voles and birds.  The mammals caused some localised problems for several landowners, including flooding land and damaging trees, but these could be addressed successfully with âactive managementâ, the study said.  Professor Richard Brazier, who led the University of Exeter research team, said benefits also included water quality improvement, carbon storage, and a boost to local businesses through wildlife tourism.  He said: âWe show that any conflicts can be managed swiftly and efficiently and also that the benefits of beavers far outweigh any costs associated with their management.â  Beavers are credited with providing a range of benefits to local areas (Picture: Devon Wildlife Trust)  Now attention is turning to the national strategy for releasing and managing beavers in England, amid reports that the rodents are already living wild on other rivers and with many being introduced into enclosures in the countryside.  Last month, conservationists said beavers had been born in Essex for the first time since the Middle Ages.  James Wallace, director of the Beaver Trust, said: âHaving shown through research and community engagement many of the benefits, challenges and ways of living alongside beavers, it is time to apply the learning from the River Otter Beaver Trial across the rest of the country.â  Advertisement  Advertisement  He said the Beaver Trust, Devon Wildlife Trust and other conservation, fishing, farming and forestry stakeholders are developing proposals for an English beaver strategy.  âWe invite the Government to collaborate with us on planning, resourcing and supporting the future management and restoration of beavers across suitable river catchments in England,â Mr Wallace explained.  Beavers did cause some localised problems, but experts say benefits âfar outweighâ the costs (Picture: Devon Wildlife Trust)  Wildlife groups back the wider return of the aquatic mammals, which manage the landscape by cutting down trees and damming rivers, for the benefits they can provide.  There are high levels of public support for beavers returning to England, and some landowners are keen to use the landscape engineering they perform to help ârewildâ parts of the countryside to help nature.  But farmers have raised concerns that they can damage farmland.  There have also been calls for funding for landowners to support them to make space for beavers, which are now classed as an endangered native species, in the landscape.  The Government is planning a consultation later this year on the national strategy for beavers in England and how to manage them.  In a tweet, the Green Party said: âWIN! For the first time in 400 years, Beavers will live in the wild in Britain.  âThese amazing creatures increase biodiversity, reduce flood risk and enrich our natural world.  âThis is a huge win for nature.â  Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

(pic: Microsoft)  Microsoft has said that Xbox Live Gold will continue into the next generation of consoles, but they wonât say whether itâll be free or not.  Despite mounting evidence that Microsoft was planning to bring an end to Xbox Live Gold, and having to pay for online multiplayer, theyâve now denied that any major changes are in the pipeline.  âWe have no plans to discontinue Xbox Live Gold at this time,â a Microsoft spokesperson told The Verge. âIt is an important part of gaming on Xbox today, and will continue to be in the future.â  That seems pretty unambiguous at first but what they wouldnât do is comment on suggestions that Xbox Live Gold is going to become a free service.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  The rumours began when fans noticed that Microsoft had stopped selling 12-month subscriptions to Xbox Live Gold, implying the service wouldnât last that long.  Then they suddenly changed the wording of the Microsoft Services Agreement, to remove the words âXbox Liveâ and just refer generically to âXbox online serviceâ.  According to Microsoft though this was merely to distinguish been the paid Xbox Live Gold subscription and online services in general, with the spokesperson insisting, âThere are no changes being made to the experience of the service or Xbox Live Gold.â  So, Xbox Live Gold isnât going anywhere but the real question is whether youâll have to pay to play online multiplayer games in the future. And thatâs something Microsoft doesnât really address.  The problem for Microsoft is that PC gamers donât have to pay to play online whereas Xbox owners still do. Not only that but Halo Infiniteâs multiplayer is going to be free-to-play, which further complicates things.  The closer Microsoft treats to integrate the Xbox and PC formats the harder it becomes to charge one for online and not the other, so while they have said theyâre not discontinuing or renaming Xbox Live Gold that doesnât mean they wonât make it free next generation.  Under exactly what circumstances though we donât yet and, as with everything else related to the next generation, weâll just have to continue waiting until more information is revealed.

In the last week alone, 4,642 were transferred to the system, with 79% being reached by tracers â down from 81.4 per cent the week prior.  Tracers identified the names of 19,150 people who had come into close contact with a person who had tested positive.  The test and trace system has been running for nine weeks (Picture: Getty)  Of those, 72% were reached and asked to self-isolate â marking a 76% drop from the previous week.  The figures show that while local health protection teams were able to contact most (98%) close contacts of positive cases, call centres are struggling to reach people.  Out of cases handled online or by call centres, only about 56% of close contacts were reached.  Get in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.

However, she wants to warn others that something as small as a pain in their leg could be a serious cause for concern.

We know that giving our living space a good clean will likely make us feel better in the long run, but itâs tough to remember that at the start of the process, when weâre confronted by piles of clutter.  So hereâs a reminder of why itâs worth the bother, in the hope that someone elseâs story might help motivate you when the mess feels insurmountable.  Single mum Bex Kitchen, 25, was struggling with her mental wellbeing, having suffered with depression and anxiety for years.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  The struggle of handling mental illness while working and raising a four-year-old alone meant Bexâs home became a âdumping groundâ, and she simply didnât have the energy to give it a good tidy.  Bex found it difficult to keep the room tidy while battling depression (Picture: Bex Kitchen)  But in lockdown and on furlough, Bex decided to take advantage of the extra time on her hands, as well as a lift in her mood, to sort out her home.  Bex told LatestDeals.co.uk: âI just really wanted to create a calm, jungle-themed bedroom. I am a single mum. I have a four-year-old and have wanted a second child for a really long time, so Iâm considering adopting.  She took the decluttering process slowly and gently (Picture: Bex Kitchen)  âHowever, for now, Iâm just about to apply to Ofsted as a childminder after using lockdown to study childcare from home. This room will be where any minded babies I look after take their naps.  âIâm autistic with anxiety and Iâve suffered from depression for a long time so the room ended up being a dumping ground and I didnât have the energy or executive functioning to deal with it.  âNow Iâm coming out of depression, I want to get my life on track, especially as my fiancÃ© left me in January, so I just decided one day it was now or never to take control of my life and that includes making my home somewhere I can truly enjoy and relax in.â  Then one day in lockdown, Bex did the bulk of the work â hereâs the end result (Picture: Bex Kitchen)  Bex spent just Â£170 transforming the cluttered space in her home into a peaceful room for the kids she childminds, with a subtle jungle theme.  She was able to save cash by using some laminate flooring she had from a previous home, that had sat in the garage unused for two years, and looking out for bargains from Ikea and Hobbycraft.  âSo I only paid out Â£32.48 on tools and underlay for the floor,â says the mum. âThe cot was from when my son was a baby, and so was the bedding and curtains.  âThe drawers are Nordli from Ikea, the Kallax is from Ikea, the rug was Toftland and cost Â£7 from Ikea, and the trolley was Â£28 from Hobbycraft.  Along with a good tidy, Bex added some DIY touches (Picture: Bex Kitchen)  âThe handmade clock was made by Emma Steel in Spalding who runs LightArtedly, the watercolour prints were from LauraSladeArt, the canvas map was from The Range and the embroidery hoop was from Rosie Wild at Phoenix and the Cub.  âIâm a big believer of supporting small businesses so thatâs what Iâve tried to do! Overall, if you add up all the furniture, flooring and art it was about Â£170 that Iâve spent this year on the room.â  Advertisement  Advertisement  Bex made the DIY project manageable by starting to declutter little by little a month ago, then doing one big day of tidying last week, when she had a surge in energy.  Itâs lovely, right? (Picture: Bex Kitchen)  She says that the end result, as well as the journey of decluttering, has given her a mental health boost in a challenging time.  Bex added: âDecluttering was the hardest part but I had to be ruthless and throw out 70% of what was in the room,â she adds.  âI think this project has given me something to focus on during lockdown and also improved my mental health.  âPoor mental health can contribute to a messy house and then a messy house makes your mental health worse, in a vicious cycle.  âSo clearing up even just one room has made a big difference to my mood! Every time I walk past the room I smile.  âNow that room is done, I feel energised to transform the rest of the house and so relieved too. Itâs my favourite room in the house now.â  Do you have a story to share?  Get in touch by emailing MetroLifestyleTeam@Metro.co.uk.

Debbie Adlam, whose son was dragged to death aged 28 while trying to stop thieves fleeing with a quad bike last year, said the outcome of his killersâ trial shows âsomething needs to changeâ.  PC Harper was caught in a tow rope dangling from the back of the car pulling the quad bike.  Driver Henry Long, 19, passengers Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both 18, were sentenced to 16 years and 13 years in prison respectively for manslaughter.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  Long was given a reduction on his sentence because he pleaded guilty and could be released on licence after 10 years and eight months in jail.  Cole and Bowers could be released on licence after serving less than nine years.  Legislation requires that two-thirds of a sentence is served before prisoners become eligible for release, while court guidelines often result in lower sentences for younger offenders.  Speaking on ITVâs Good Morning Britain today, Ms Adlam said: âThe blue light services go out while weâre sat in bed or watching TV or going to the pub, theyâre out there putting themselves in harmâs way â and thatâs why they deserve a bit of extra protection.

To me thereâs just no need for the reduction because heâs not 21â¦ [at that age] you can change your gender, you can get a mortgage, it just doesnât make sense.  Speaking on Wednesday, she argued âAndrewâs Lawâ would make sure sentences âdefine the crimeâ of killing officers, although she accepted no sentence will help her family get over losing her son.  The Attorney Generalâs office has been asked to review whether the sentences were too lenient and has 28 days from Tuesday to come to a conclusion.  The request was made by the Tory MP for PC Harperâs constituency, John Howell, to assess âwhether the punishment fits the crimeâ.  Sentencing the teenagers last Friday, Mr Justice Edis told the Old Bailey: âManslaughter cases range greatly in seriousness.  Andrew Harper died trying to stop the trio making off with stolen goods in Bekrshire (Picture: PA)  Henry Long, 19, Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both 18, left school long before 16 and had a long history of stealing (Picture: PA)  âSometimes death may be caused by an act of gross carelessness, sometimes it is very close to a case of murder in its seriousness. That is so, here.â  Ms Adlam said she âtotally believesâ longer minimum terms would deter people from killing or seriously injuring police officers.  She said: âThey just get their uniform on, and off they go again time and time again, and if somebody doesnât stand up and look after them when thereâs an injury or somebodyâs killed â we see from this experience that they are not being protected.  âThereâs nobody looking out for them and we aim to change that.â  Asked how she felt about the teenagersâ reaction after they were cleared of murdering her son, she said: âThere was one apology which wasnât a true apology and it was not an apology I believed. It was gut-wrenching.  âIt sends a signal out to other people of âSee, we got away with itâ.

The scale of the devastation has been laid bare now the smoke and toxic red cloud have blown away.  A huge circular section of land where a warehouse once stood is now full of water after it was blasted away along with surrounding buildings and ships.

Lebanonâs government has put an unspecified number of Beirut port officials under house arrest pending an investigation into how the highly explosive chemical came to be stored at the port for years.

In the series, The Handler (played by Kate Walsh) is seen speaking the Jewish language Yiddish â among a series of other dialects â but some have, in turn, slammed the show for an inappropriate portrayal of an âevil Jewâ stereotype.  As the character is also part of a secret organisation that helps maintain the timeline within the UA universe, itâs also been claimed she is representative of a conspiracy theory that powerful Jewish people are secretly running the world.  When approached by Metro.co.uk about the criticism, Blackman said in a statement: âThe accusation of antisemitism in The Umbrella Academy is hurtful and, more importantly, factually incorrect.  Advertisement  Advertisement  Advertisement  âI wrote these episodes, created the character, and am myself Jewish.  âWhile I understand audiences sometimes receive things in a different way than creators intend, The Handler was not created as an anti-Semitic character.â  Kate Walsh plays the impeccably dressed time traveller (Picture: Netflix)  âThe Handler speaks every language, including Swedish, Mandarin, Yiddish, and English as we saw this season, and The Commission is not an evil organisation; they do not control finances, governments, or the media.  âThe only thing they control â and more importantly, protect â is the timeline of our fictional Umbrella Academy universe.â  Anti-Semitic backlash about The Handler started during the first season, where critics argued the series is a deliberate attempt at negatively portraying the Jewish community.  The Jewish writer said there was no anti-Semitism(Picture: Netflix)  âJews have been persecuted throughout history because people think they are a secret organisation bringing about the end of humanity and global domination,â one viewer explained in a thread on Twitter.  âSo, when the show had the handler speaking Yiddish, it implies that sheâs Jewish, because goyim [non-Jewish people] simply just donât usually speak it.â  The language of Yiddish was originally used by Ashkenazi Jews, and at one point was a prominent language of the Jewish community.  However, World War II caused a decline in the use of the language, with almost 85 percent of those killed during the Holocaust were Yiddish-speaking Semites.  While it is still used in some Hasidic communities of the faith, it is not as prominent as it once was.  The Umbrella Academy is available on Netflix now.  Got A Story?

It will be 75 years this week since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which began the period in history that came to be known as the nuclear age.  If an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) were to head to London, the warning time would be measured in minutes, not hours, said Dr Lyndon Burford, a post-doctoral research associate in the Centre for Science and Security Studies at Kingâs College London.  Advertisement  Advertisement  âThe Prime Minister would have minutes to make it to a safety bunker,â he said.  Advertisement  As for the public, Dr Burford said he is sceptical of the UK Governmentâs assertion that it could respond to a single nuclear use in an urban area, citing a warning given by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in 2013 that, as things stand, âthere is no effective way of delivering humanitarian assistance to victims of a nuclear blastâ.  Dr Burford added: âWe have learnt that ionising radiation has a gendered impact â women and girls are disproportionately impacted by the negative effects. We donât know why, but thatâs what the science says.â  Modern nuclear weapons can achieve yields of 1,000 kilotonnes (Credits: Getty Images)  The nuclear weapons that exist in todayâs arsenal are âmuch more powerfulâ than the ones used to bomb Hiroshima and Nagasaki, said Matt Korda, a research associate for the nuclear information project at the Federation of American Scientists (FAS).  The warheads that bombed the Japanese cities on August 6 and 9 in 1945, nicknamed Little Boy and Fat Man, achieved blasts of around 15-20 kilotons.  The first US atomic bombing killed 140,000 people in Hiroshima, while the second atomic attack on Nagasaki killed another 70,000.  âBy contrast, todayâs weapons can achieve yields of several hundred, sometimes over 1,000, kilotons, due to the introduction of multi-stage thermonuclear weapon designs during the early years of the Cold War,â Dr Korda added.  âA nuclear detonation of several hundred kilotons over the centre of London would destroy most of the city, and could break windows as far away as Croydon and Walthamstow.â  A nuclear strike on London now would be much more deadly than in 1945 (Getty Images)  According to the FAS, the number of nuclear weapons in the world has declined significantly since the Cold War, down from a peak of around 70,300 in 1986 to an estimated 13,410 in early 2020.  The FAS estimates that around 91% of all nuclear warheads are owned by Russia and the United States, which each have around 4,000 warheads in their military stockpiles.  The military theory of mutually assured destruction (MAD), in which a nuclear attack by one superpower would be met with an overwhelming nuclear counter-attack, thus acting as a deterrent to nuclear warfare, is a hotly debated topic.  Dr Burford said: âMany former military and governmental experts are increasingly pointing out that, even if deterrence did work in some instances â and we can never âknowâ in the scientific sense, because deterrence is an internal, psychological process â in other cases, it is clear that luck played a significant role in preventing the use of nuclear weapons.  Advertisement  Advertisement  âSo, did MAD work? Only if we accept that at a minimum, sometimes we just have to leave it to luck to determine whether or not we have a nuclear war.â  Professor Malcolm Chalmers, deputy director-general at the Royal United Services Institute, said the use of nuclear weapons against the UK is most likely to take place during a time of extreme national crisis or war.  âA deliberate âbolt from the blueâ attack cannot be ruled out altogether, but it is extremely hard to see what an enemy could hope to achieve,â he said.",https://metro.co.uk/2020/08/06/what-happen-nuclear-bomb-hit-london-13092056/,https://metro.co.uk/feed/,1ed63d7da6e4b95678a8af91cac08a65ce2820190646330f22a7790151a1451b,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Dublin City Council has issued a warning letter to the hotel, formally advising it that complaints have been made against it and that it is under investigation for breach of the law governing protected structures.  Under the Planning and Development Act, no change can be made to a protected structure that would affect its character without prior planning approval.  The hotel did not seek planning permission and, up to this morning, had not submitted an application for retention of the changes it made.  A spokeswoman for Dublin City Council said the investigation may take some time.  âOur planning staff will need to speak with the complainants and consider any submission the hotel may make within the four weeks and then look at where things stand as regards the law before deciding the next move,â she said.  The Irish Georgian Society and other conservationists complained after the sudden removal last month of four life-size bronze statues that had adorned the hotel entrance since 1867.  At the time the hotel indicated it had taken down the statues in light of the Black Lives Matter movement which led to the removal or damaging of statues abroad which were linked with the slave trade and those who benefited from slave colonies.  The statues are of four women from ancient Africa, two of whom appeared to be shackled, but debate has raged since as to whether or not they actually depicted slaves.  Other commentators have argued that regardless of whether or not they are slave girls, the statues have artistic merit and historical importance and should not have been removed.  Anti-racism activists defended the move, saying the depiction of African women, whether as slaves or curiosities, was offensive.  Under the planning acts, Dublin City Council has powers to order the restoration of the statues if their removal is found to breach regulations. If the matter escalated and proceeded to court, a range of fines and penalties can apply.  No-one from the hotel was available to comment.

Helen McEntee said the Government hoped law enforcement would only be needed in a small minority of cases, as has happened with rules about masks on public transport.  Read More  Face coverings will be mandatory in retail outlets and shopping centres from Monday, August 10.  Staff in shops will need to ask members of the public to put on a mask before they enter the store. Since last month, people using public transport have been required by law to wear a mask. Exceptions are made in a small number of cases, including where a person has a health condition which would stop them being able to wear one.  Speaking on Thursday, Ms McEntee said that the government was taking a âsimilar approachâ to rules for face masks in shops to rules for face masks on public transport. Ms McEntee said that shop staff would initially need to try to enforce the new rules.  âThe retail outlet or the shopkeeper would go to extent to show that, perhaps with signage, that masks need to be worn on the premises. If someone is without one or remains inside the premises without one, there would be engagement with them and the retail outlet - either the owner or the person working in the shop. In a last resort, An Garda SÃ­ochana would be called,â she said.  Ms McEntee said that throughout the pandemic, the government had âengaged with people and asked them to complyâ with new rules including the need to wear face masks in public.  âIn the vast majority of cases, people have done that. If we look at transport and the introduction of face coverings, there has been a huge level of compliance and itâs only in a small minority of cases that the gardaÃ­ have needed to step in. So we hope that this would be the case,â she said.  The Taoiseach confirmed this week that face masks would become mandatory in shops and shopping centres from August 10. MicheÃ¡l Martin said that the public had shown throughout lockdown that when âgiven a clear direction, they follow it.â  ""We need to wear a mask when on public transport and in retail settings,â Mr Martin said.

But Joe Schmidt's successor will maintain the IRFUâs hard-line policy regarding overseas-based players by reiterating that another celebrated winger will not be considered for a recall.  Speaking this morning, Farrell also insisted his side will be targeting a title win when the Six Nations resumes, gave his tentative backing to a proposed eight-team international tournament and championed Stuart Lancaster to be added to the Lions coaching ticket next summer.  Leinster's Kiwi-born sensation Lowe will become eligible for Ireland in November as one of the last players to benefit from the much-maligned ""three-year"" residency rule and many supporters feel he could be a game-changer for Farrell's men as they bid to renew their Six Nations title tilt.  Read More  ""He's been great,"" enthused Farrell in a morning conference call. ""He's been a great tonic for Irish rugby really and he's played some outstanding rugby over the years.  ""Like everyone else, we'll see how he comes back and how he performs in the early parts of the season and there are plenty of big games in which he can put up his hand. He is the same position as everyone else.  ""He is available from the beginning of November and we need to make sure we get selection correct accordingly and he will be part of our plans in the same way as everyone else is.  ""He's a big guy, he's strong, he loves getting on the ball as much as he can, he comes off his wing, he is hungry for the ball, he doesn't like getting tackled that much, he has a great left boot and he is good in the air as well.  ""He's a great all-round player. I'm sure he can see parts of his game where there is room for improvement as well. Hopefully we can see him in top form so he can push his claims for selection.""  However, one of Lowe's charismatic predecessors in the Irish provincial arena, Simon Zebo, will remain excluded from contention as he contemplates a final season in exile with Racing 92 in Paris before a possible return to Munster next summer.  ""The unwritten rule is there to protect Irish rugby, so I'm all for that. If Simon Zebo, like anyone else, came back into Ireland and played his rugby here and was on top of his game, like we know that type of form that Zeebs can bring, then obviously we'd look at him the same as everyone else.""

A court heard that Patrick O'Connor (39) was stopped and held at the scene by another hospital worker who witnessed the alleged assault.  Judge Michael Walsh granted the accused bail despite garda objections and adjourned the case at Dublin District Court for the directions of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Mr O'Connor, of no fixed address, is charged with sex- ually assaulting the woman on July 30.  Objecting to bail, the prosecuting garda cited the seriousness of the allegations.  Innocence  Outlining the prosecution's case, he said it was alleged the accused approached a female member of staff outside the A&E department at 7.20am.  She had cycled to work and was putting her bike in a rack.  ""He approached from behind and pinched her buttocks with his right hand,"" the garda said.  The accused tried to leave the area, but was stopped by another staff member.  Gardai arrived and Mr O'Connor was arrested and charged.  On the strength of the prosecution evidence, the garda said the incident was captured on CCTV and the accused could be ""clearly seen assaulting the female"".  Mr O'Connor was arrested while wearing the same clothing as was seen in the footage, the garda said.  The accused accepted it was a serious charge, but he was entitled to a presumption of innocence, his barrister Garrett Casey said.  Applying for bail, Mr Casey said he did not believe the gardai had made adequate grounds for a refusal.  Judge Walsh said the charge was serious, although it app-eared to be at the ""lower end"" of the scale for sexual assault.  Although the CCTV evidence ""appears to be overwhelming"" and the court had been told the accused could be clearly seen touching the woman, Mr O'Connor was presumed innocent and the onus was on the prosecution to show bail should be refused.  He said the purpose of bail was to ensure an accused turned up for trial and did not engage in criminal behaviour pending that.  ""I think it's a case that can be dealt with by very strict conditions,"" the judge said.  He granted bail in the acc-used's own bond of â¬500, with no cash lodgment required.  Mr O'Connor must sign on daily at a garda station, have no contact directly or indirectly with the alleged victim or her family and stay away from St James's Hospital.  The judge said this last condition applied except for bona fide, pre-arranged appointments, after the accused said he had to go back for a scan.

But Lebanon, which was already mired in a severe economic crisis, faces a daunting challenge in rebuilding.  It is unclear how much support the international community will offer the notoriously corrupt and dysfunctional government.  Mr Macron, who viewed the devastated port and was to meet senior Lebanese officials, said the visit is âan opportunity to have a frank and challenging dialogue with the Lebanese political powers and institutionsâ.  He said France will work to co-ordinate aid but warned âif reforms are not made, Lebanon will continue to sinkâ.  Later, as he toured one of the hardest-hit neighborhoods, an angry crowd vented its fury at Lebanonâs political leaders, chanting ârevolutionâ and âthe people want to bring down the regimeâ, slogans used during mass protests last year.  Mr Macron said he was not there to endorse the regime and vowed French aid will not fall into the âhands of corruptionâ.

The head of Lebanonâs customs department meanwhile confirmed in an interview with LBC TV late Wednesday that officials had sent five or six letters over the years to the judiciary asking the ammonium nitrate be removed because of the dangers it posed.  But Badri Daher said all he could do was alert authorities to the presence of dangerous materials, saying even that was âextra workâ for him and his predecessor.  He said the port authority was responsible for the material, while his job was to prevent smuggling and collect duties.  The judiciary and the port authority could not immediately be reached for comment.  The Government said on Wednesday that an investigation is under way and that port officials have been placed under house arrest.  The investigation into the explosion is focused on how 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical used in fertilisers, came to be stored at the port facility for six years and why nothing was done about it.  The cargo had been stored at the port since it was confiscated from a ship years earlier.  Based on the timeline and the size of the cargo, that ship could be the MV Rhosus.  The ship was initially seized in Beirut in 2013 when it entered the port due to technical problems, according to lawyers involved in the case. It came from the nation of Georgia, and had been bound for Mozambique.  The stockpile is believed to have detonated after a fire broke out nearby in what appeared to be a warehouse holding fireworks.  Mr Daher said he did not know if there were fireworks near the ammonium nitrate.

Local news reports say the repair work was ordered by security forces who investigated the facility and were concerned about theft.  Security officials have declined to comment while the investigation is under way.  Port officials have rejected the theory in interviews with local media, saying the welders completed their work long before the fire broke out.  Dr Firas Abiad, director general of Rafik Hariri University Hospital, which is leading the coronavirus fight in the country, said he expects an increase in cases in the next 10 to 15 days linked to crowding at hospitals and blood donation centres after the blast.  The explosion was the most powerful blast ever seen in the city, which has survived decades of war and conflict.  Several city blocks were left littered with rubble, broken glass and damaged vehicles.  Authorities have cordoned off the port itself, where the blast left a huge crater and destroyed a large grain silo.

Lebanese authorities have blamed a huge stockpile of the highly explosive material stored for years in unsafe conditions at Beirut's port for Tuesday's explosion, which killed at least 145 people and injured more than 5,000.  It is estimated about 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate were involved in the explosion.  By comparison, Australia's Orica stores between 6,000 to 12,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate (AN), on average, at its Kooragang Island plant in the port of Newcastle, the company said in a statement.  The stockpile has led resident groups to campaign for the plant to be relocated, according to several local media reports.  ""It's a totally inappropriate place to have such a dangerous material produced and stored, and it's something we've been complaining about for many, many years,"" chemical engineer and community campaigner Keith Craig told the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC).  He is one of 300 residents in the Stockton Community Action Group campaigning for the Orica plant to be relocated, or its stockpiles to be significantly reduced, the ABC reported.  In a statement, Orica said it followed all international standards and local regulations to ensure safety at every stage of the manufacturing supply chain.  ""AN storage areas are fire resistant and built exclusively from non-flammable materials,"" Orica said.  ""...we take a rigorous, best-practice approach towards safety in the production, storage and transport of all our products.""  ""You have to be extremely negligent with AN for it to explode,"" it said. It said video footage of the Beirut explosion suggested fireworks had been stored close by. Some reports say a welder started a fire.  ""This cannot be compared to the responsible and heavily regulated production, storage and transport of AN by Orica and others in Australia,"" Orica said.

Ian Coulter (49), a former managing partner of commercial law firm Tughans, and Frank Cushnahan (78), former chairman of Belfast Harbour, will be charged over the Â£1.2bn (â¬1.3bn) sale of the toxic property loans which had been held by the Republicâs bad bank, Nama.  It had been Northern Irelandâs biggest-ever property transaction.  Mr Coulter also faces two counts of concealing criminal property.  Mr Cushnahan is set to be charged with two counts of fraud, while Mr Coulter faces three counts of fraud - including one joint count with Mr Cushnahan.  The Public Prosecution Service today announced the charges after it took over investigations into the deal from the National Crime Agency.  However, another six people who were also investigated by the PPS under the same file will not face charges.  The PPS said: âAfter consideration of a complex and substantial file submitted by NCA investigators, it has been decided that there is sufficient evidence to prosecute two suspects in connection with alleged activity around the property deal known as Project Eagle.  âA 78-year-old man is to be charged with one count of the offence of fraud, contrary to Section 1 of the Fraud Act 2006 involving a failure to disclose  information between April 1, 2013 and November 7, 2013.  âThe 78-year-old and a 49-year-old man are also to be jointly charged with one count of fraud, contrary to Section 1 of the Fraud Act 2006 involving a false representation made on or around the April 3, 2014.â  Itâs understood Mr Cushnahan is the 78-year-old referred to by the PPS, while Mr Coulter is the 49-year-old.  The PPS added that the 49-year-old also faces charges of two more counts of fraud. One count of fraud, contrary to Section 1 of Fraud Act 2006 involves a false representation made on or around September 11, 2014 while another count involves making an article in connection with a fraud on or about August 13.  There are a further two counts of the offence of concealing criminal property, contrary to Section 327 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 involving concealing, disguising or transferring criminal property between September15, 2014 and December 1, 2014.  A total of nine individuals have been considered by the PPS over the sale and attempted sale of Namaâs Northern Ireland property loan book to two US investment firms in 2014.  The PPS said there was not enough evidence to prosecute the six other individuals. A decision was previously taken not to prosecute one suspect in November 2018 arising out of the Project Eagle investigation.  PPS Assistant Director Ciaran McQuillan said: âWe have been working in close partnership with the National Crime Agency in respect of its wide-ranging investigation into the sale of Namaâs property loan book in Northern Ireland.  ""We would like to take this opportunity to recognise the diligence of the NCA in this investigation and the comprehensive nature of their enquiries.  âA considerable volume of evidence submitted to the PPS has been painstakingly examined by a team of experienced and senior prosecutors, with the benefit of advice from two Senior Counsel.

Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright has seemingly questioned the clubâs decision to make 55 members of staff redundant.  The FA Cup winners made the announcement on Wednesday and pointed to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on finances as the reason for the move.  In a statement issued by the clubâs head of football Raul Sanllehi and managing director Vinai Venkatesham, they pointed to severe drops in broadcast revenue â with the PA news agency understanding the cuts will come across some football departments as well as commercial and administrative roles.  Wright tweeted his apparent dismay at the news, writing: âRemember who you are, what you are and who you represent!!!â as he retweeted Arsenalâs original post.  It is also believed Arsenalâs current plans in the transfer market will not be affected by the job cuts, as Chelsea winger Willian continues to be heavily linked with a free transfer to the Emirates Stadium.

Revenue from broadcasters, matchday and commercial activities have all been hit severely and these impacts will continue into at least the forthcoming 2020/21 season.  âOver recent years we have consistently invested in additional staff to take the club forward but with the expected reduction of income in mind, it is now clear that we must reduce our costs further to ensure we are operating in a sustainable and responsible way, and to enable us to continue to invest in the team.  âOur aim has been to protect the jobs and base salaries of our people for as long as we possibly can.

2020-08-06 13:21:52.792733,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 10:00:00 GMT",David Moyes interview: West Ham manager on âone of the toughest testsâ of his 22 years in management,"When you have been in management for 22 years, there are bound to have been some bumps along the way.  For David Moyes, though, the past few months at West Ham have been â in his words â âone of the toughest periodsâ in his managerial career.  At Preston and then Everton, Moyes had a reputation as a builder of clubs, but he switched to firefighting mode twice at West Ham, arriving both times midway through a troubled season and with the club in relegation trouble before ultimately staying up with a bit to spare.  At the end of a short contract in 2018, West Ham said thanks but no thanks as they appointed Manuel Pellegrini. When that move did not work out and they found themselves one place above the bottom three at the turn of the year, West Ham ignored advice about ânot going backâ and turned again to Moyes.  This time, the 57-year-old has one more season on his contract to begin the building process of a club with huge potential but which hasnât been reached in recent times.  Moyes said: âThis one has been one of the toughest periods Iâve had in management. It said a lot about the clubâs owners that they were big enough to come back for me, knowing that I had done a good job the first time. My history is one of building clubs, picking young players. I have ideas of how things should look and West Ham are a prime club for that. It has incredible potential which is a bit untapped. There are a lot of things going for this club. Do I think we can go from the position weâre in to right at the top? No â letâs be more realistic.â  In his first spell at West Ham, Moyes converted Marko Arnautovic from an erratic wide player to an explosive central striker. In the past few months he did something similar with Michail Antonio, whose scoring run post-lockdown was a vital component in the teamâs survival.  West Ham, in fact, were the third highest scorers in the Premier League following the restart and the sixth highest since January, when Moyes took over.  âLetâs continue to make progress,â said Moyes. âLetâs see something which excites the supporters but letâs also continue to build this team. Ultimately, though, thatâs not my decision. Thatâs the way we should be going but the owners need to agree that yes, this is right direction for this club.â  West Hamâs recruitment in recent seasons has been, at the very least, erratic and Moyes revealed the club are looking for a head of recruitment. âI also want to make sure coaches Paul Nevin and Kevin Nolan are here for next season, plus one or two other small changes I want to make around the club,â he said.  âWe would like to strengthen in a lot of areas. Weâre lacking in defensive cover. Weâre also looking to see who could move on, because that could change the direction we take during the transfer window.  âThe owners have spent a lot of money in the last few years and Iâm not sure a similar amount will be available this time. Whatever there is, though, we will spend it wisely.  âWeâre trying to bring in a younger group but we will also need a couple of experienced players. Central defenders are usually better when theyâre more experienced.â  Regarding prime asset Declan Rice, who has been linked with a big-money move to a number of clubs, but particularly Chelsea, Moyes said: âAt the moment there have been no offers for Declan and we donât want any. Thereâs always interest but we donât want to encourage it.â  West Ham's summer transfer plans 4 show all West Ham's summer transfer plans 1/4 PA 2/4 Target: Eberechi Eze QPR    Midfielder Getty Images 3/4 Target: Ryan Manning QPR    Defender/Midfielder Getty Images 4/4 Target: Antonee Robinson Wigan Athletic    Left-back Getty Images 1/4 PA 2/4 Target: Eberechi Eze QPR    Midfielder Getty Images 3/4 Target: Ryan Manning QPR    Defender/Midfielder Getty Images 4/4 Target: Antonee Robinson Wigan Athletic    Left-back Getty Images    Pride, relief and emotion are not words liberally sprinkled by Moyes but he has felt them all during the last few months.  âI had less time than on the first occasion I was here,â he said. âI also felt there was a bigger expectation, partly because of the players that had been brought in and also because it is a big club, it has big support and people want it to be doing well. The hope was that we would have enough time and, although itâs been a really tough time for everyone, the lockdown did give us a bit of breathing space.â  West Ham did lose their first two games after the restart but were then beaten in just one of their subsequent seven to ensure safety.  âI was really emotional when we beat Norwich, because I knew that probably that result was the one to keep us up,â said Moyes. âThe over-riding emotion was relief. The players have shown a great sense of togetherness and team spirit and I thought we did it with a bit of style as well.  âPride is not a word I use very often but this was a big achievement. I want to be at the top, I want to be challenging for Europe, but I canât promise that. At the same time I want to give them[the fans] hope. I want to get back to that level â Iâve been there before.  âIt canât happen overnight. You can have a good year and then a bad one, but if youâre continually going to chop and change, that will always happen.

The Scottish Governmentâs Health Secretary said schools reopening in the city as scheduled on Tuesday is a priority but warned additional measures may be required if necessary.  Jeane Freeman confirmed on this morning the latest known figures of 54 cases in the city with 191 contacts traced so far.  She also told the BBCâs Good Morning Scotland radio programme it was important to recognise the complexity of the cluster â in comparison with similar outbreaks in Inverclyde and Lanarkshire â with the number of venues involved.  Ms Freeman said: âIt is unlikely that one person has been to all 28 or so venues that have been named â what is more likely is that more than one person has been to more than one venue.  âThat is part of the complexity of this, the nature of it if you think about some of the other outbreaks that we have responded to, and traced right through to the end of the transmission chain.  âIn some ways, theyâre all very very important but in some ways they have been less complex than this, which is largely centred around the night-time economy in Aberdeen and could be the night-time economy in any city or town.  âIt is complicated to know exactly where everyone has been and thatâs part of test and protect, which of course we need to remember is still under way, weâve not concluded this yet.â  Asked about the process being carried out before schools in the city return next week, she said: âIt depends on how quickly the technical problems can be resolved and importantly that our senior statistician confirms that he is confident that that data is robust.  âThe priority is to get the schools back, weâre being really clear about that as a priority across the country as itâs one of the most important things that we that we do.  âIf there is a need for additional measures to help us do that, either in the north east or anywhere else, then I think youâve seen that we are prepared to take those additional steps.  âBut right at the moment there is nothing to tell me that we need to do more in Aberdeen city that we have already done.â",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/uk-coronavirus-live-latest-updates-lockdown-a4517816.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,16a77390eafb879d879a78813fe3167fda2f4381a6ad8700a04279cf98e297ae,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The reality star previously explained that she had decided not to have surgery in Turkey and was instead waiting to consult with doctors upon her return home.  After touching down in the UK earlier this week, Price headed off to an appointment with a consultant on Thursday and shared an update with her followers on her Instagram story.  Price received bad news at her appointment (Instagram @katieprice)  âJust finished my appointment with my consultant and surgeon about my feet,â she wrote.  âAfter further scans, the news is absolutely devastating. Iâm gutted.â  Katie Price - In pictures 64 show all Katie Price - In pictures 1/64 Back to school Katie Price attends a photocall to launch her app, Katie Price Official on December 2, 2015 in London Getty Images 2/64 Big Bro Katie Price enters the Celebrity Big Brother in 2015 PA 3/64 In bed Katie Price and her finace Leonadro Penna launch her new summer lingerie range for Katie's Boutique available exclusively at Store Twenty One at The Worx on May 29, 2012 Getty Images 4/64 Katie Price and her son Harvey seen leaving BBC TV Studios SplashNews.com 5/64 Katie Price leaves Horsham Magistrate's Court SplashNews.com 6/64 Katie Price listed her pink car on eBay 7/64 Katie Price and Kris Boyson are seen here leaving Shooshh Night Club in 2018 Splash News 8/64 Price participates in the 2018 London Marathon Getty Images 9/64 Katie Price and Kieran Hayler attending the ITV Gala in 2018 PA 10/64 Katie Price leaves the Loose Women set after getting upset while talking about her mother's health in 2017 Rex 11/64 Katie Price arriving at the ITV Gala held at the London Palladium in 2017 Getty Images 12/64 Katie Price with children Bunny, Jett and Harvey Katie Price 13/64 Katie Price poses at a photocall for her new novel 'Playing With Fire' at The Worx Studio's in 2017 Getty Images 14/64 Katie Price at the launch her book, 'Reborn' at the Worx studios in 2016 PA 15/64 Katie Price and Kieran Hayler with Junior and Princess launch her new reality television show, Katie Price's Pony Club in 2016 PA 16/64 Katie Price arriving for the TV Choice Awards 2016 held at The Dorchester Hotel, Park Lane, London Daniel Leal-Olivas/PA 17/64 Katie Price walks the runway at the Fashion For Relief charity fashion show to kick off London Fashion Week Fall/Winter 2015/16 at Somerset House Getty Images 18/64 Katie Price on the catwalk during the Fashion for Relief a charity fashion show hosted by Naomi Campbell for the Ebola crisis in Africa at Somerset House in 2015 PA 19/64 Katie Price at Celebrity Big Brother in 2015 Channel 5 20/64 Katie Price attends a photocall to launch ""Sleeping Beauty"" at New Victoria Theatre in 2015 Getty Images 21/64 Katie Price during a photo call to mark the 5th birthday of KP Equestrian, her equestrian clothing company, at the Worx Studios in Parsons Green, west London.

On Thursday's show, Mr Mullins told hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that the scheme needed to be shuttered ""as quick as possible"".  ""Let's not kid anyone - the majority of people now are in a position to go back to work but unfortunately they don't want to go back,"" he said.  ""If you're paying anybody to sit at home and do nothing, then that's what they're going to do.""  Speaking from the grounds of his home in southern Spain, Mr Mullins went on: ""Most people's workplace is too far from the beach for them.  ""We need to end it, it's had its day. We needed to do it at the time, we now need to move on, get the economy going, get people back into the workplace and stop this stupid culture of people thinking that they can sit at home and just be paid for it.""  Since, many viewers have reacted with anger to Mr Mullins' claims, with one saying: ""I got made redundant from sitting at home and being 'paid for it' I haven't had my normal income and 80 per cent of my wage meant my bills were only just getting paid. It must be so easy to say that from all the way over in [Marbella] living an easy life.""  Another added: ""A lot of people would love to go back to work Charles, but if their employers are following government guidelines then there's nothing the employee can do, and if they want to sit at home and relax then fine, they've probably been worked to the bone on minimum wage up to now.""  Others took issue with Mr Mullins discussing the scheme from his holiday home in Marbella.  However, some viewers supported Mr Mullins' comments, saying: ""Why are so many people so furious at the guy? He owns the company and can run it from anywhere he likes. Heâs offering people the chance to get back to work and have full pay again. Jealousy is a horrid trait.""  Another agreed: ""Yes, people will actually only start to realise the restrictions being forced on their lives when they are made to get off their sofas and go back to work, everywhere needs to open up and people make their own choices, not moan about everyone elseâs!""  Around 9.6 million workers in the UK had been furloughed as of August 2, according to Government figures. That means the Treasury is paying 80 per cent of the wages of those people, up to Â£2,500 per month.  Since August businesses have had to pay National Insurance and pension contributions for furloughed staff - coinciding with a spate of new redundancies. From September they will pay 10 per cent of wages, rising to 20 per cent in October. The scheme is currently planned to stop at the end of October.  About 1.2 million firms have used the furlough scheme, at a cost of around Â£33.8 billion so far. This is expected to rise to around Â£80 billion, the Government has said.  While the furlough scheme has cost a significant amount of money, some economists argue that extending it past October would be in the public interest.  Garry Young, deputy director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: âThe planned closure of the furlough seems to be a mistake, motivated by an understandable desire to limit spending.  ""The scheme was intended by the Chancellor to be a bridge through the crisis and there is a risk that it is coming to an end prematurely and this increases the probability of economic scarring.â",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/pimlico-plumbers-charlie-mullins-this-morning-marbella-a4518246.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,194fc5b19ebb512e6d43d2bea861c841dca6d55c5b8bf1775bea027eaf62f25b,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:21:55.088979,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 11:03:00 GMT","England vs Pakistan LIVE first Test score: Day two commentary - TV, cricket live stream today","Welcome to the Evening Standardâs LIVE coverage of day two of the first Test between England and Pakistan.  The home side made a strong start after being asked to bowl first in the series opener at Emirates Old Trafford, nipping out Abid Ali and Azhar Ali while conceding just 53 runs in the morning session.  That control fell away in the remainder of a rain-interrupted day, with Babar Azam batting beautifully for 69 not out to lead his side to 139 for two when bad light intervened.  England have not beaten Pakistan in a Test series on home soil in a decade â will they end their run this time?  Will Macpherson and Malik Ouzia will bring you all the action on day one from Old Trafford.  Live Updates  England's morning no doubt, with Anderson and Broad superb and then well backed up by wakes, in particular. All three have wickets, including the crucial one of Babar Azam, and with the new ball due in five overs they have a chance to press on after lunch. PAK 187/5 (75.0 overs) Masood 77, Shadab 1 Dom Bess is going to get the obligatory over before lunch and I suspect he might get a few more afterwards because thereâs a nice bit of turn and bounce on offer. Sandwiches. PAK 185/5 (74.0 overs) Masood 75, Shadab 1 Oof, thatâs risky. Shadab is understandably desperate to get off strike and off the mark against Archer but this is a very tight single and Popeâs pick-up is good. A direct hit wouldâve been interesting but itâs just wide. Advertisement PAK 179/5 (72.0 overs) Masood 70, Shadab 0 Shadab has a wild flay at one outside off and gets nothing on it. The timing could work out perfectly for England here, too, because if they can take one more wicket in the next few overs theyâll have a new ball to go at the tail with pretty soon after lunch. Mind you, this one is still doing plenty so they might not be in a hurry to take it. PAK 176/5 (71.0 overs) Masood 67, Shadab 0 Pakistanâs batting line-up is not the deepest. Shadab Khan, the spinning all-rounder, is in next and then theyâre into the tail. I fancy Masood might carry his bat here. Will Macpherson is at Old Trafford Woakes has been terrific again today. The ball is 70 overs old and he's got it doing all sorts. Advertisement WICKET WICKET! Rizwan c Buttler b Woakes 9 PAK 176/5 (70.1 overs) Another one bites the dust! Lovely delivery from Woakes, just as these two were looking like they had weathered the storm. Jos Buttler had an iffy day with the gloves yesterday but heâs taken a smart catch there. PAK 174/4 (69.0 overs) Masood 64, Rizwan 8 Just a couple of loose deliveries in the over from Woakes, one full and straight that Shan flicks round the corner to deep fine leg for the first boundary in about six years. PAK 167/4 (68.0 overs) Masood 57, Rizwan 8 Pakistan are going absolutely nowhere at the moment. Theyâve scored 28 runs from 19 overs this morning, ten of which have been maidens. Advertisement PAK 166/4 (66.0 overs) Masood 56, Rizwan 8 Just about the best shot that Rizwan has played as plays off the back-foot through cover but it wonât quite reach the boundary so theyâll run three. PAK 161/4 (64.0 overs) Masood 56, Rizwan 5 Thatâs a very good start. Bit of extra bounce and Rizwan is cut in half, hansât got a clue as it whizzes through him and over the stumps. PAK 160/4 (63.0 overs) Masood 56, Rizwan 4 Drinks have been taken after a very good first hour for England. Woakes sends down another probing over and itâll be time for a bit of Jofra Archerâ¦ Advertisement PAK 152/4 (61.0 overs) Masood 50, Rizwan 4 Joe Rootâs won the argument and Chris Woakes is on. He was superb yesterday and has it on a string straight away, shaping away from Rizwan as he goes wafting outside off. Finally, off the fifth ball of the over, there are some runs as Rizwan gets off the mark with a couple. PAK 150/4 (60.0 overs) Masood 50, Rizwan 0 Six maidens in a row. Woakes and Archer are limbering up but Joe Root is going to have a job getting the ball off these two. PAK 150/4 (59.0 overs) Masood 50, Rizwan 0 Mohammad Rizwan, the wicketkeeper, is in at six and facing Anderson and Broad with their tails up. Broad is off celebrating as the ball looks like it beats the outside edge before it clips Rizwanâs back pad. The finger goes up but the batsman reviews instantly which tells you all you need to know â a faint edge. Advertisement WICKET WICKET! Asad c Stokes b Broad 7 PAK 150/4 (56.5 overs) The pressure was building and itâs told! Broad this time finds the edge and Ben Stokes, moving to his left from second slip, takes the catch. Englandâs premier bowlers have delivered. PAK 150/3 (56.0 overs) Masood 50, Asad 7 Another maiden for Anderson, who was expensive yesterday afternoon but looks in control here. PAK 150/3 (55.0 overs) Masood 50, Asad 7 A maiden apiece to the bowlers. Another early wicket would make this an excellent start for England. Advertisement PAK 149/3 (53.0 overs) Masood 50, Asad 6 Asad Shafiq is in at five and is off the mark first ball glancing Anderson off his pads and he soon has his first boundary, too, pushing nicely through point. PAK 143/3 (51.0 overs) Masood 50, Asad 0 Broad likes this, likes this a lot and Ben Stokes does too with a big appeal as Shan is hit on the front pad. Joe Root looks less convinced but he eventually sends it upstairsâ¦ shouldâve gone with your gut, Joe, a little bit of bat involved first. Masood survives, and with a couple of nicely-worked twos he brings up his seventh Test half-century off 156 balls. Next  Canât see the England vs Pakistan LIVE first Test score blog?

The company, which handles immigration, defence and IT contracts, intends to pay back Â£48 million in deferred taxes, principally VAT, early, by the end of the year.  Boss Rupert Soames told the Standard: âThe government is doing all it can to make sure companies did not run out of cash. We are fine on cash and when we feel we are out of the woods we will pay that back early, all being well by the end of the year.â  Serco, which received Â£5 million of support through the furlough scheme, also wonât be using the Government's Â£1000 job retention bonus, saying it doesnât want to take money from taxpayers to fund services paid for by then. The company said: ""We do not intend to take advantage of the UK government's Â£1,000 per person re-employment incentive as we do not think it right that we should take money from the taxpayer to employ people who will be delivering services paid for by the taxpayer.""  Soames said investments in recent years had allowed the company to mobilise rapidly to respond to the crisis across the gloobe. ""We commissioned the UK's first drive-through test centre in two days; in Australia accommodation was provided for more than 1,300 quarantined travellers on one week's notice; and as part of the NHS Test & Trace programme we mobilised 10,500 contact tracers in a four-week period,"" he said.  Revenues rose 24% to Â£1.8 billion in the first-half, with profits up 53% to Â£77.6 million. Soames said Covid had had a ânet zeroâ effect on profits â it has picked up contracts including helping with virus testing, but has seen revenues fall in its leisure centres and rail businesses, and added costs in its health arm.  Serco apologised in May after it accidentally shared almost 300 email addresses of new recruits to the Governmentâs coronavirus contract-tracing programme.  Serco shares, up strongly since the outbreak, fell 22p to 147p on a cautious outlook for 2021.  In a Buy note, Peel Hunt analyst Christopher Bambury said: ""With FY20 guidance similar to pre-Covid levels, this reflects the resilience of the business. Serco has good headroom against both leverage covenants and facilities, and forecast leverage is low.""",https://www.standard.co.uk/business/serco-taxes-revenues-a4518291.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,fead90bd2701319ffe5d445982542135ecfb846458d8fadc52e7cbff8a8ce4cf,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Next season will be the Finnish driver's fifth with the Silver Arrows. Team-mate Lewis Hamilton's future beyond this year is yet to be confirmed but it is expected the six-time world champion will also stay with Mercedes.  Bottas, who won the opening round of the season in Austria, said: ""I'm very happy to stay with Mercedes in 2021 and build on the success we've enjoyed together already.  ""The past few years have been all about continuous improvement, working on every aspect of my performance. I'm confident that today I'm the strongest I've ever been, but I can always raise the bar.  ""Ever since I fell in love with F1 as a kid it's been my dream to one day become world champion. I'm in the fight for the title this year and staying with Mercedes puts me in the best possible position to compete for it next season as well.""  Bottas had widely been expected to be retained by Mercedes, particularly after their junior driver, George Russell confirmed he will be staying at Williams until the end of next season.  While not quite on Hamilton's level, Bottas provides stability at Mercedes - with the all-conquering team on course for a remarkable seventh straight drivers' and constructors' championships.  Team principal Toto Wolff said: ""We are very excited that Valtteri will stay with the team for at least one more season. We're seeing the strongest Valtteri we've ever seen this year - in terms of his on-track performance, but also physically and mentally.

The piece, commissioned by the Imperial War Museum, is titled I Saw The World End and responds to the moment that the nature of war changed course.  Artists Es Devlin and Machiko Weston have been sharing a studio space for more than 12 years, âoften exploring fictional apocalypses in drama and opera, but this is the first time we have jointly explored the impact of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings on our respective cultures.â  During lockdown, the pair took time to research and collate pieces of text in English and Japanese separately, with the results appearing on a split screen. The half in English traces the origin of the atomic bomb in fiction with HG Wells, alongside accounts from the protagonists of the Manhattan project. The Japanese half is made up of accounts from the moments the bombs landed.  Devlin and Weston added that the split-screen expresses âthe potential for division...splitting the atom, the division between fiction and fact, race divisions, the division between humans and the planetâ.  I Saw The World End is part of the Imperial War Museumâs series marking the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II.  Last week, the museum unveiled Ai Weiweiâs 1,000 square ft installation, History of Bombs, which depicts 50 to scale bombs from World War I to the present day in its atrium.

The exploit, which has, strangely enough, remained present in previous Animal Crossing games, can only be done if you have a hacked Switch console.  This lets you change software and add programmes to your Switch, allowing you to mess around with the game files and allow players to grow items like star fragments, fossils and endless supplies of money or other rare items on trees.  However, some of these trees are purely cosmetic and don't drop actual items. Regardless, Nintendo has seen fit to remove them all, as per its patch notes.  ""The following issues that occurred in Ver. 1.4.0 have been fixed â an issue where trees could mature and contain things other than the normal fruit, etc"".  It is important to note that this hack is currently available and remains unbanned in Animal Crossing: New Leaf.  True enough, some mechanics in Animal Crossing are obtuse and it is completely up to the RNG (random number generator) if you see any shooting stars on your island, and further to this, the type of star fragment which lands on your island after wishing on a shooting star is completely random.  So it is clear to see why people might turn to hack the game, in any capacity, but Nintendo definitely doesn't want this to happen.  The tree growth hack was very popular among fans of the game, who are now lamenting its removal.  Despite the trees being mostly for cosmetic purposes, some players who were running modded versions of the game were essentially creating a marketplace whereby other players would buy the trees with real money.  This all came about after dreaming was introduced to Animal Crossing: New Horizons in a recent update.  Dreaming allows you to visit saved versions of other peoples' islands and during some of these trips, players reported seeing the island with star fragments growing on trees.  Some of the dream islands reported to Nintendo have been taken down or the island's creator has been slapped with a ban.  This small patch was released on August 5, which addressed a few other minor issues as well.",https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/gaming/animal-crossing-new-horizons-star-fragment-tree-hack-a4518256.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,1cf52a6970ae7641e8d19477e5f70492aa2c2c93e58f5797ff85441b3bc5a291,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Josephine Conlon, 36, had been pushing her baby in a pram in Streatham, south-west London, when she was set upon by Mark Brazant on the afternoon of December 30 last year.  Brazant, 44, who had gone awol upon being freed from jail on Christmas Eve, stabbed her seven times in the face and neck before running off.  At his trial, Brazant had denied meaning to seriously injure Mrs Conlon and a jury was discharged after failing to reach a verdict despite more than 40 hours of deliberations.  But on Thursday, he admitted attempted murder after the prosecution called for a retrial.  Previously, the court had heard how Brazant, who has paranoid schizophrenia, had a history of attacking lone women for no reason and had a conviction for carrying a blade.  In January 2017, he collided with a woman, swore at her, grabbed her arm and shoved her away.  On November 26 last year, he attacked four women on the same day, grabbing one by the neck after accusing her of smiling at him, and punching another for laughing.  He pleaded guilty to three charges of battery and one of common assault, but was released on licence from Thameside Prison on Christmas Eve to spend a year on post-sentence supervision.  On his release, he reported to the probation service but records show he was asked to return the following week as Thameside had sent him to the wrong office.  Brazant was reported missing after he failed to turn up at a supported house for people with mental health problems in which he was meant to stay.  On December 30 last year, Mrs Conlon was returning home after meeting other new mothers at a local bakery.  CCTV footage showed the moment she crossed paths with Brazant in the street, prompting the defendant to follow her.  Mrs Conlon told jurors that she first realised she was âin dangerâ when she was shoved forcefully in the back.  She fell into a driveway, and the buggy containing her baby daughter rolled on to the kerb and became wedged next to a parked car.  Mrs Conlon told jurors: âI remember thinking he had pushed me into the driveway because he was going to rape me.  âThen he didnât, he just started hitting me.  âI realised I was being stabbed. I was screaming a lot because I was not in the road so I wanted somebody to hear me.  âI was ducking and trying to get away and trying to get up on to my feet.  âI could feel blood. The adrenaline took away pain but I could feel things dripping.â  She added: âI managed to get up on my feet and thatâs when he turned and ran away.â  She screamed for help and neighbours came to her aid before medics arrived.  Mrs Conlon, who was supported in court by her husband Greg, was discharged from hospital the next day but continues to have treatment for scars to her face and neck, the court heard.  In the early hours of January 2, Brazant walked into Wandsworth police station carrying a knife, and said he had âstabbed a person on the street two days earlierâ.  During his trial, Brazant, of Ealing, west London, had denied he intended to kill Mrs Conlon, saying he was hearing voices telling him to hurt someone.  He said he chose Mrs Conlon because she was small, female, pushing a buggy and he did not think she would fight back.  Having stabbed her repeatedly, he told himself âthatâs enough, that will doâ and left, he said.  The court heard Brazant was on medication for his mental health condition but had stopped taking it.  He had admitted unlawful wounding, but denied attempted murder and an alternative charge of wounding with intent.  Brazant entered his new guilty plea via video link from Three Bridges medium secure hospital.  Mrs Conlon sat in court with her husband by her side.  Defence lawyer Oliver Renton said: âThis is not a matter which has been unaffected by the inability because of the current pandemic to be heard again this year.  âMr Brazant was told the matter could not be resolved until 2021 at trial and his pleas follow on from that.â  Judge Mark Lucraft QC set a sentencing date for September 16 and remanded him into custody.",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/streatham-mother-stabbing-mark-brazant-guilty-attempted-murder-a4517966.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,56d58ffde2fdd5dbf8ca712c3f9e7795ecc9be56dfc07a8b0bef065cff9a890d,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

According to the user, the âgenuinely terrifyingâ man claimed he had been ignored by Clarke when he showed up at other red carpet events and shouted hateful things at her while speculating on ways to meet her.  In a thread shared by user @ReinaVCosplay, she said, âSo, I have a disturbing Emilia Clarke-related story from when I saw âThe Seagullâ that I donât believe I ever shared before, but it makes me understand why she disappears so much.â  Clarke starred in the Anton Chekhov play at The Playhouse Theatre in London this year, prior to the showâs shutdown amidst the coronavirus pandemic  Clarke has previously spoken about her experience with stalking in the past to The Guardian, with incidents including a stalker leaving gifts outside her front door and two others who were described as âextremely unwell, another extremely mean.â  The user flagged the thread for mentions of aggression and stalking and said she had been waiting at the stage door, where other fans of Emilia Clarke were also waiting for the cast to emerge - including a man she nicknamed ""Drunkie"" who she said was ""obviously drunk & belligerent.""  She claimed that the man swore and used abusive language about Clarke when describing her to other fans nearby. He also claimed he had tried to speak with her at other red carpets, however she ""didn't respond.""  The unnamed man was accompanied by a friend, who was sober, tried to keep him at âbayâ and later asked the user out for a drink. The friend also reportedly âexplained that he does this a lot, tries to meet celebs and hates on them. And Drunkie proved him correct repeating his Emilia hate to all nearby.â  However, things escalated as Clarke emerged from the theatre and went straight towards her car. The man did not and she claimed he began shouting at Clarke to come out, then attempted to approach. Eventually, the man was convinced by his friend to leave.  The user continued, âHe was relentlessly & loudly saying awful things about Emilia and you could see the windows where the cast probably was. He was loud enough to hear and purposely. He really wanted Emilia to know she was terrible in his eyes, which he implied was the only interaction that matters.â  âYou hear about these kinds of celeb stalker-type stories all the time. But, it was genuinely terrifying to see in-person. See the hate this guy was spewing and the anger in his face towards someone whose only crime was not responding to him,â the user continued. âThat was scary as an everyday woman, who has experienced this with 'scorned' guys.â  âI can only imagine how it must be for a public figure. So, I get it. If that was my life, Iâd be THE most hermiting hermit to ever hermit. It was really jarring as a fan & bystander,â the user finished.  Evening Standard Insider has reached out to Emilia Clarke's team for comment  .Clarke previously told The Guardian that being stalked was âjust horribleâ and said it could be âconfusingâ, as some of them believed they were in relationships with her.  She discussed trying to balance the fear of her stalkers with her relationship to her fans, explaining: âHaving a relationship with people I donât know is a big part of what I signed up for. I care about what art does to people. But it carries with it a responsibility, and when you leave your front door you take that with you. And itâs a difficult path to navigate.â  âBecause sometimes you get grabbed physically and your instincts kick in. When you see shock being registered on someone elseâs face, youâre like, âWhereâs the danger?â And then you realise, oh, itâs me â Iâm the danger,â she continued.  According to Paladin, a National Stalking Advocacy Service in the UK, up to 700,000 women are stalked on average each year based on data between 2009-2012 and ""only 15% of cases of stalking and 16% of cases of harassment recorded by the police result in a charge and prosecution.""",https://www.standard.co.uk/insider/alist/emilia-clarke-stalker-experience-twitter-a4518046.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,b8222283b171b4028b26453b611f92de203677afd26fae7a7d0b5c549ef3a8ab,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Preston City Council chief executive Adrian Phillips said local authorities were facing up to the prospect of possible Government intervention after ministers imposed stringent restrictions on other parts of Northern England battling rising Covid-19 caseloads a week ago.  âWe know our rates are increasing and they have increased over the last week to a level now where we are concerned that we could face Government intervention,"" Mr Phillips told BBC Breakfast on Thursday.  âThere is a concentration in inner areas as there usually is in any urban environment, but itâs in villages, itâs in our suburbs,"" he said.  Data from Public Health England shows Preston recorded 49 new cases of coronavirus in the week leading up to July 31, with 18 cases recorded on July 29 alone.  The figure marks a more than two-fold rise in infections from the week before, when 22 coronavirus cases were recorded.  The majority of the spread of Covid-19 is occurring through households and community transmission, according to a statement on Preston City Council's website citing evidence from Public Health England.  âThe city is surrounded by areas that have had enforced measures implemented by Government and we want to act now to stop that from happening (in) Preston,"" the statement said.  In a bid to reduce levels of transmission, Preston City Council has advised residents in the Lancashire city to avoid having visitors to their homes.

Wasnât as good as it should have been.â  Their visit to the care home yesterday made headlines as it was the first time that Kate had been seen wearing a face mask in public, opting for one with a dainty floral pattern.

Latest weekly statistics from the NHSâs controversial Test and Trace system revealed that 4,966 people tested positive for Covid-19 between July 23-29.  This is 713 more cases than in the previous week, and the third successive weekly rise.  All but 11 of the additional cases were in the âcommunityâ rather than in hospital â being detected in drive-through centres or via home-testing kits.  Todayâs figures also show that the Test and Trace system, which is costing the Government Â£10 billion to set up and run, performs worse when it faces a higher workload.  In the most recent week â the ninth since it was established at the end of May â it reached 79.4 per cent of the 4,642 infected people it was asked to trace, down from 81.4 per cent in week eight.  Of the 19,150 contacts of those infected people who were identified, 72.4 per cent were reached and asked to self-isolate, a decrease from 76.2 per cent in the previous week.  The 4,966 new coronavirus cases â up from 4,253 in week eight â were obtained from 390,242 tests, the most carried out in any week since Test and Trace launched.  More than three million âpillar oneâ (hospital or outbreak locations) and âpillar two (drive-through or at-home) tests have now been performed since Test and Trace launched. Of these, a total of 48,157 people have tested positive.  The latest 17 per cent weekly increase in new infections was more than four times greater than the extra number of tests performed, which was up four per cent week on week.  Results from nine in 10 hospital tests were received within 24 hours. For all community tests, results for just over half (53 per cent) were received within 24 hours.  This ranged from 76 per cent for results from regional drive-through sites being received within 24 hours, to 72 per cent of results from home-testing kits being received within 48 hours, because of the delay caused by posting the test samples.  The number of people who had tested positive for coronavirus in England who were not reached by Test and Trace increased from 634 (14.9 per cent) in week eight to 873 (18.8 per cent) in week nine.",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-cases-up-17-test-trace-latest-figures-a4518171.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,c648a280f1335d0e683f43abc2633f94c8a4171aee3838704a33dffb91cde0db,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The CPS initially wanted to give Ms Flack a caution for striking boyfriend Lewis Burton on the head, but the Met appealed that decision to try to force a criminal prosecution .  The Love Island host, 40, was arrested on December 12 last year, and took her own life two months later while awaiting her trial.  Questioning DI Bateman this morning, Mrs Flack said the criminal charge was âlife changingâ for her daughter and urged the officer to think carefully before making future decisions.  âIf it was an ordinary person, you wouldnât have been bothered with that that nightâ, she said. âI know the world, Iâve seen domestic abuse, and I just think you should be disgusted with yourself because nothing can bring Caroline back but this didnât need to happen.â  Saying she hoped the officer regretted her decision, she said: âThat girl killed herself because you put an appeal through.â  Ms Flack was arrested at her north London home after Mr Burton called 999 to claim that his girlfriend was attacking him.  âDid you take into account that Mr Burton was intoxicated, and had been drinking all day?â, asked Mrs Flack.

Mr Burton is accused of taking pictures of blood-soaked sheets after Ms Flack had been taken away by police, and then passing them on to friends including an ex-girlfriend. The images then appeared in The Sun.  âYou left Mr Burton in her home, he didnât live there,"" continued Mrs Flack. âHe was allowed to take pictures of the blood of Caroline and send them to friends, and they appeared in national papers. It was not explained it was her blood, not his.  âYou did not do DNA, You say it was a serious domestic abuse case but you didnât investigate it.â  Mrs Flack challenged DI Batemanâs decision not to speak to Ms Flack before seeking a criminal charge, saying: âYou never saw Caroline, you never saw any evidence, you went on a drunken phone call from a man.â  The officer replied: âIn hindsight I could have gone to speak to her, but routinely I wouldnât have done that.â  DI Bateman said she had no idea how long Ms Flack spent in custody, and was unaware her sister had spent nine hours outside Holborn police station waiting for her.  Mrs Flack said police are being investigated over the handling of the case, insisting: âThis so important to me. I will never get Caroline back but she was not an abuser.â  DI Bateman told the hearing: âIâm not saying Caroline was an abuser.â  Earlier, the inquest heard how the Met Police believed Ms Flack was getting special treatment as a celebrity when the CPS initially recommended not prosecuting her for domestic violence.  Alison Wright, a CPS prosecutor, said in a report that she initially decided a police caution was the right call, but her decision was appealed by the Met.  âThe police claim I have taken a biased view because Caroline flack is a celebrityâ, she wrote. âI have explained this is not the case, just because she is a celebrity doesnât preclude her from having the guidelines applied to her.  âShe should and is, in my opinion, be treated the same as any other suspect presented to the CPS for a charging decision.â  Ms Wright said she believed <s Flack had admitted the offence, and a letter from the presenterâs solicitor had suggested a caution for ABH might be the appropriate outcome.  However the Met lodged an appeal against the decision, and a senior lawyer within the CPS ultimately opted to charge Ms Flack with assault.  DI Lauren Bateman was asked if she had been âmotivated by Carolineâs celebrity statusâ when pursuing the appeal, but she replied: âAbsolutely not. I would have done absolutely the same with others. I know that to be the case.â  She added: âAlthough I disagreed with the caution, the appeal process is having a conversation with a senior lawyer and while saying I disagree in the appeals process it is for the CPS to make a final decision.â  Ms Flackâs family have claimed she was being pursued for a âshow trialâ, suggesting the decision to bring a criminal charge showed she was being âtaught a lesson in a way a non-celebrity wouldnât have beenâ.

Psychological distress is also common for coronavirus survivors, according to new data from the University of Leeds.  Scientists examined 100 patients who had been in hospital with the virus - 68 who were on a ward and 32 who were treated in intensive care - four to eight weeks after their discharge.  Fatigue was the most commonly reported problem across the group, with more than 60 per cent of those who were on wards suffering with it and 72 per cent of those who were critically ill.  People in both groups also said they had experienced feelings of breathlessness which they had not suffered before contracting the virus.  This was higher in those who had been critically ill - 65.6 per cent compared to 42.6 per cent.

The broadcaster behind Coronation Street, The Chase and Love Island saw ad sales tumble 21% to Â£671 million in the six months to June.  Profits, even on an EBITA basis, halved to Â£159 million. No dividend will be paid.  Carolyn McCall, ITV chief executive, said: ""This has been one of the most challenging times in the history of ITV. I am really proud of the way that our colleagues have responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and helped demonstrate the enduring value of ITV as a Public Service Broadcaster. ITV continues to inform and entertain the nation throughout this crisis, across our six channels including 10 hours of live broadcast every weekday as well as increased content on ITV Hub and BritBox.  ""While our two main sources of revenue - production and advertising - were down significantly in the first half of the year and the outlook remains uncertain, today we are seeing an upward trajectory with productions restarting and advertisers returning to take advantage of our highly effective mass reach and addressable advertising platform, in a brand safe environment.""  ITV is targeting cost cuts, but still expects to spend Â£960 million on programming this year.

The 40-year-old Love Island host was facing a criminal trial over an allegation she had attacked her boyfriend Lewis Burton while he was sleeping, fearing he had been cheating on her.  Ms Flack had appeared in court last December to deny the assault charge, and was four weeks away from her trial when she took her own life at her Stoke Newington home on February 15.  On the second day of the inquest this morning, coroner Mary Hassell revealed the contents of a note found on an open magazine near her unconscious body.  She said the message, in Ms Flackâs handwriting, referred to her desire to âfind harmonyâ with Mr Burton and added: âPlease let this court case be dropped.â  The TV host, who had fronted The X Factor and Love Island, was arrested at home on December 12 last year after Mr Burton called 999 to say she was attacking him.  She was taken into custody and ultimately charged with assault by beating, but the inquest learned yesterday that the CPS had initially wanted to deal with the case with a police caution .  Mr Burton had been bleeding from a wound to his head when police arrived, and he suggested he had been struck with a lamp or desk fan by Ms Flack.  In her police interview, the TV host said she had a phone in her hand when she made contact with Mr Burtonâs head, but insisted any injury was accidental.  Detective Inspector Lauren Bateman, from the Met Police, said when the CPS opted not to charge her and recommended a police caution, she lodged a challenge to that decision.  âThere was no clear admission of guilt, it is unclear what she was admitting to or what she was actually saying happenedâ, she said.  âIn the account from Mr Burton, he believed he had been assaulted with a lamp while asleep at his home address.  âThat wasnât the account she gave, there wasnât a clear admission of guilty, and the case wasnât suitable for a caution.â  The officer said a note was circulated to senior Met officers about the arrest, which reads: âMs Flack was naked and covered in blood, apparently from cuts to her left wrist.

I admit I did it.â  The police memo added that there was doubt over the object used, after Mr Burton refused to cooperate with the investigation and Ms Flack said she was holding a phone in her hand at the time. Her phone was later seen covered in blood with a cracked screen in one corner.  DI Bateman said she pushed for a prosecution as Ms Flack had suggested in her police interview that the incident was an accident, which she believed was different to her admissions at the scene.  Denying she had been âsplitting hairsâ, the officer added: âI appreciate how it might look, but in my view it wasnât clear.â  The inquest heard how the Met Police believed Ms Flack was getting special treatment as a celebrity when the CPS initially recommended not prosecuting her for domestic violence.  Alison Wright, a CPS prosecutor, said in a report that she initially decided a police caution was the right call, but her decision was appealed by the Met.  âThe police claim I have taken a biased view because Caroline flack is a celebrityâ, she wrote. âI have explained this is not the case, just because she is a celebrity doesnât preclude her from having the guidelines applied to her.  âShe should and is, in my opinion, be treated the same as any other suspect presented to the CPS for a charging decision.â  Ms Wright said she believed Ms Flack had admitted the offence, and a letter from the presenterâs solicitor had suggested a caution for ABH might be the appropriate outcome.  However the Met lodged an appeal against the decision, and a senior lawyer within the CPS ultimately opted to charge Ms Flack with assault.  DI Bateman was asked if she had been âmotivated by Carolineâs celebrity statusâ when pursuing the appeal, but she replied: âAbsolutely not. I would have done absolutely the same with others. I know that to be the case.â  She added: âAlthough I disagreed with the caution, the appeal process is having a conversation with a senior lawyer and while saying I disagree in the appeals process it is for the CPS to make a final decision.â  Ms Flackâs family have claimed she was being pursued for a âshow trialâ, suggesting the decision to bring a criminal charge showed she was being âtaught a lesson in a way a non-celebrity wouldnât have beenâ.

A formal decision to refer the former foreign secretary to an investigatory panel headed by a lawyer is expected this afternoon.  Sources said they were sifting through a âconsiderable volumeâ of complaints from the public about the language used by Mr Johnson.  But party leaders also hope referring the issue to the independent panel will cool the outbreak of Tory infighting that has given Jeremy Corbyn a breather from Labourâs anti-Semitism row.  âIt is not personal and it has nothing to do with Brexit, it is simply the same rules that apply to everyone in the party,â said a well-placed source.  The party code sets out âminimum standards of behaviourâ. It says elected Tories must âlead by example to encourage and foster respect and toleranceâ and act âin a manner which upholds the reputation and valuesâ of the party.  In a Daily Telegraph column on Monday, Mr Johnson mocked the appearance of women who choose to wear the burka and niqab , saying they resembled letterboxes and âbank robbersâ.  Met Commissioner Cressida Dick today ruled out a criminal investigation, telling the BBC Asian Network: âI spoke last night to my very experienced officers who deal with hate crime â¦ my preliminary view is that what Mr Johnson said would not reach the bar for a criminal offence.â  But he could face a Whitehall probe into claims he broke the ministerial code by announcing he was taking up the highly-paid Telegraph column before getting consent. A formal complaint to Theresa May was made this morning by ex-Labour minister John Spellar after former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he believed the rules had been broken.  Conservative MP Anna Soubry said: âI hope this will be investigated quickly. Boris Johnson needs to show more respect â whether itâs to important rules governing the conduct of former ministers or the choices women make on what to wear.â  Mr Spellar said it appeared to be a âclear breachâ of ministerial code which states ministers leaving Cabinet âmustâ seek advice from the independent Advisory Committee on Business Appointments before taking up a job.  A source close to Mr Johnson conceded he had written to Acoba only after an announcement that he had taken up the column.  Two days after Tory chairman Brandon Lewis ordered the former minister to apologise for the burka remarks, Mr Johnson was maintaining his silence. A Sky News poll found 45 per cent of voters thought he should say sorry, while 48 per cent thought he should not.  It came as London Labour MP Rupa Huq delivered an impression of him on Channel 4 News, saying: âSorry, I just shagged your wife, I didnât realise, sorry.â",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-to-face-tory-code-of-conduct-probe-in-burka-storm-a3907511.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,415728165bf83f945e684718cbce6d3f62a68611a2663fa730a98287ac91a9be,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:03.502271,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 10:09:00 GMT",The Bank of England may have ditched the V-shaped recovery but it's still too optimistic about the economy,"One thing the Bank of England got right in its lengthy forecasts for the economy today: the risks of our projections are âskewed to the downsideâ.  And then some.  While Threadneedle Streetâs finest have finally rowed back from their reality-defying V-shaped recovery, they still take too rosy a view of the parlous state in which we find ourselves.  Particularly in the near term.  In short, the Bankâs view was until today âbad this year, good next yearâ. Now, itâs âgood this year, not so good next yearâ.  In reality, it should be: âhorrible this year, horrible next year, a bit less bad the year after that. Fingers crossed.â  Its misguided optimism is based on recent surveys showing resilient consumer spending. But for many people, theyâve only been spending because the furlough scheme has given them the false idea that they still have a job.  Sadly, they will soon be disabused of that notion.  The Bank underestimates this. It places, for example, too much stock on Rishi Sunakâs Â£1000 payment to employers for bringing staff back off furlough. I havenât met a CEO yet whoâs said that will make a jot of difference.  It also bases its outlook on a Brexit featuring a full free trade deal on January 1. Thatâs punchy when the talks are at a stalemate.  It then gives too little emphasis to the long-term damage from the halt in companiesâ R&D investment â already low post the financial crisis.  Predicting the future these days is a horrible task, but the Bankâs tendency towards optimism seems misguided.

Robert Jenrick said people with secure jobs âshould be safely going out to shop and to use cafÃ©s and restaurants and getting back to work to support the economyâ.  The strongly worded intervention from the Communities Secretary came as the Bank of England warned that the recovery from the worst slump in almost a century would be slower than initially forecast, though the downturn will not be as deep as feared.  In a further grim forecast, the Bank also suggested more than a million jobs could be lost by Christmas.  The Evening Standard has launched a Saving Central London investigation because so many jobs and businesses are under threat with so few workers, tourists and day-trippers visiting the city.  Asked about the centre of the capital being âhollowedâ out, Mr Jenrick told LBC Radio: âIâm very concerned about London and city centres more generally. Many of our city centres are very quiet and we need to get back into them, using the Chancellorâs Eat Out To Help Out scheme, going to visit shops safely, it can be done.  âShops and the hospitality industry are going to great lengths to make sure they are following social-distancing guidelines and those of us who can do so need to get out and support them now or else we will see, Iâm afraid, further job losses and a loss of some of those fantastic businesses that we see in our cities.â  In a direct appeal to millions of people whose jobs are not under threat, he added on BBC Breakfast: âThose of us who can, who do have secure jobs, should be safely going out to shop and to use cafÃ©s and restaurants and getting back to work to support the economy.â  The economy has been gradually revving up as lockdown has been eased. Many firms in central London as well as some Whitehall departments are bringing staff back into their offices, but at a cautious rate.  However, concerns are now rising that some of the relaxation of the Covid-19 restrictions may have to be reversed as the number of cases rises, with several towns in the north â including Preston today, as well as Aberdeen â already bringing in measures to combat local surges in infections.  The Bank of England said today that economic output will not return to levels seen before the start of the pandemic until the end of next year.  In its quarterly Monetary Policy Report, it said the recovery from the deepest slump in almost 100 years would be slower than initially forecast.  The Bank expects GDP to contract by 9.5 per cent in 2020, less than the 14 per cent it originally predicted, with a nine per cent bounce in 2021. This compares with a forecast of 15 per cent growth in the last report in May.  The bank said the recovery had been âearlier and more rapidâ than it had forecast in its last report in May, with lockdowns lifted more quickly than anticipated and online spending stronger.  However, unemployment is expected to nearly double to about 7.5 per cent by the end of the year as employers react to the downturn and the end of the furlough scheme with mass redundancy programmes. The forecast suggests that more than one million jobs will be lost by Christmas.  The bankâs Monetary Policy Committee unanimously voted to leave the benchmark interest rate at the record low level of 0.1 per cent and said there would not be a rise until there was âclear evidenceâ of a strong recovery. Forecasters Capital Economics said they expected the cost of borrowing to remain at this level or even lower for âat least five yearsâ.  The committee also said it was currently considering whether interest rates could go below zero to help stimulate the economy.  Laura Suter, personal finance analyst at investment platform AJ Bell, said: âThe bank now forecasts that UK GDP will return to its 2019 levels by the end of next year, meaning itâs expecting two lost years of growth for the UK.  âItâs buoyed by the fact that people are getting out and spending more, no doubt fuelled by the summer holidays and lots of people staycationing, while Rishi Sunakâs stamp duty giveaway has also put the rocket boosters under the housing market, with the bank saying it has returned homebuying to near-normal levels.  âHowever, the bank paints a bleaker picture on the outlook for employment and business spending and cautions that the UKâs future is âunusually uncertainâ thanks to the continued spread of the coronavirus.â  The UK construction industry expanded for the second month in a row in July.  The IHS Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managersâ index hit 58.1 last month, compared with 55.3 in June. Any reading above 50 represents an expansion in business activity.  Tim Moore, economics director at IHS Markit which compiles the survey, said: âConstruction companies took another stride along the path to recovery in July as a rebound in house building helped to deliver the strongest overall growth across the sector for nearly five years.â",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/robert-jenrick-london-spending-return-work-a4518201.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,ac3b3d7594656420425f1cea70e1f7e9df74f74a59f15f416695c9a972b488e5,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The economy, says the Bank of England today, is recovering more strongly than feared â although thatâs all relative when what you feared was Armageddon and what you get is simply the worst collapse in output in recorded history.  So is Britain on the mend? Not if you look at the one bit of the British economy that pays the bills for life across the rest of the country, London. Itâs no exaggeration to say that the centre of our amazing city is dying. Zone One isnât quite deserted but the reÂ­opening of shops, restaurants, offices and galleries hasnât brought life back.  Instead, large parts of it seem to be operating in a sort of zombie half-light: Tube stations where staff outnumber travellers for much of the day, their escalators humming with no one to use them.  For a few weeks of lockdown, this looked temporary. Now the terror is that as winter arrives it might become something close to permanent.  So it was good to hear Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick spell out some truths when he was interviewed this morning. âWe need to get back into central London,â he said. âThose of us who can, who do have secure jobs, should be safely going out to shop and to use restaurants and getting back to work to support the national economy.â  That isnât the message thatâs coming from other bits of government. Our erratic Prime Minister lurches from excessive optimism about ending social distancing â by November, he said not long ago â to a funk about whether normality will ever return.  The Mayor is doing nothing to lead a fightback for Londonâs economy, not even allowing Transport for London to mount a campaign to get people out of their cars and back on to public transport in safety.  The centre of our amazing city is dying â¦ large parts are operating in a sort of zombie half-light  There will always be a debate about reopening the economy: but other countries in Europe are doing it more effectively than us.  In Britain only about a third of people who work in offices are back at their desks. In Germany it is around three quarters and in France higher than that. A direct result is that Paris is better placed to emerge strongly from the slump â and overtake London as Europeâs leading city.  The risk of that, to our long-term prosperity, and our ability to pay for happy, healthy lives with good public services, is huge. Our city needs saving before its centre becomes a wasteland of silent streets and boarded-up shops.  Keep on running  You can understand why the organisers of the London Marathon seem set to cancel plans to hold the event as normal in early October.  Bringing 40,000 sweaty, panting runners together in Londonâs streets, watched by huge crowds, wonât work with social distancing. But it is still a massive shame.  Instead of the full event they are discussing holding a shorter race for elite runners in one of Londonâs parks.  That will be a good spectacle, probably watched on television by people sitting at home.  But it will lose the joy of the marathon, which is that amateur runners, raising money for charity, can take part in the same event on the same course as world-record breakers. Everyone is in it together. Letâs hope the real marathon will be back soon.",https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/evening-standard-comment-to-save-london-we-must-go-out-again-keep-on-running-a4517981.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,a86fa9f6f6e65ff55f4824b65f434a0ac9aff25b839e92c60d7a4257205928cd,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

2020-08-06 13:22:05.110469,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 10:12:56 GMT",Julian Glover: Ripping up red tape on planning wonât create good homes for all,"Politics is being painted in primary colours. Ministers are promising a green building boom to win over a new blue wave of Tory voters in old Labour red-wall seats. What happens when you mix these colours together? You end up with a brown mess.  The Government has big ideas about reforming the planning system. The man announcing them is Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, whose last brush with planning was a ghastly Tory fundraising dinner when he entangled himself with Richard Desmond, a generous party donor who wanted help getting permission for a site in east London.  If politics wasnât transfixed by coronavirus, Jenrick might be on the backbenches for that. Instead heâs promising to rip up the planning rulebook to boost building.  A White Paper is being launched today â while Parliament is away so MPs canât make a fuss.  If you love the English countryside, admire good design in city streets and donât want a future of soulless housing estates by motorway junctions where the closest you come to human interaction may be opening the door to receive an online delivery, this is bleak news.  But letâs try giving the Government the benefit of the doubt. It has a point that the current planning system isnât working well. Change â of the right kind â might improve it. Under current rules, an awful lot of very bad housing is being built for very big profits.  Faux- Tudor pretend detatched homes are springing up on the edges of towns where they have been dumped by local plans trying to meet targets: exactly the sort of places which force people into car use, pump out carbon emissions and do nothing to encourage community life.  In London, a lot of money and precious land has gone into building two-bedroom flats (always promoted as gracious âapartmentsâ) in glass towers which turn property into an investment.  The world which encouraged these feels distant now that central London is deserted and global travel on hold.  This could be a chance to think of a way of doing things better. Covid will leave a lot of empty shops on Londonâs high streets and office blocks in our city that donât have a purpose. Making it simpler to reuse buildings like these by allowing them to become homes is a good idea â if they donât become windowless rabbit hutches.  This isnât the first Government to say it will slash red tape. There have been almost as many changes to planning legislation since rules came in in 1947 as there are days in the year. Itâs less than a decade since Oliver Letwin, in the Coalition government, pushed for more local decision making about where homes would be built, in return for a requirement imposed from above that they would happen.  Now the Government thinks that system is holding development back and it is proposing to split England, like ancient Gaul, into three parts. One will be ranked for âgrowthâ. Another for ârenewalâ. A third for âprotectionâ.  As someone who led a review last year for the Government into how we should make our most beautiful landscapes better for nature and for people, I want to see places such as National Parks protected from bad development â although that shouldnât mean no change and no building at all.  Slum clearance in east London saw good terraces bulldozed in the Sixties for shoddy flats  Doing it properly will take a sharp toughening up of the restrictions which are supposed to protect Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, including many under huge development pressure, such as the Chilterns and the High Weald, south of the capital.  But what happens in the rest of England matters, too and the new proposals are worrying. What will permission for âgrowthâ mean? Much unprotected countryside is very special.  Urban London needs better design, not a free for all.  Stripping back rules is being justified because it will make housing more affordable. But is that true? Maybe not, if big developers remain in control of supply and property remains one of the few dependable assets.  For every voter who thinks a sharp fall in prices would be good news and get them a place to live at last there will be others desperate not to see the value of their homes slashed.  A lot of things hold back building including a lack of skilled people to do the work (Brexit migration rules wonât help here) and the cost of land. Eight out of 10 planning applications are already approved under current rules. Lots of sites have permission already but donât get built.  That suggests it is our development model, not just the planning system which is the problem. We need a steady flow of building on sites which are managed over years to create liveable places, not quick turnaround profits.  Itâs true that planning doesnât in itself guarantee good housing â a lot of the stuff put up in the 70 years since we insisted on tight rules has been dreadful: think of slum clearance in east London which saw good terraces bulldozed in the Sixties for shoddy flats. But rules can help, if we get them right.  The Government should take advice from its awkwardly named Building Better, Building Beautiful commission, which reported recently.  Todayâs planning system means that things such as mews houses down quiet alleys, which sell for millions today, couldnât actually be built now. Itâs easier to get permission for an ugly, land-hungry scheme than a compact, creative, low-carbon one.  What wonât work is allowing anything to be built, of any quality, on any land not listed for protection, under the false belief that the only thing holding people back from getting homes are planning laws.  The winners from that will be big developers. As the Â£1 billion profit made by just one of them last year, Persimmon, shows, they donât need even more help to get rich.",https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/ripping-up-red-tape-on-planning-won-t-create-good-homes-for-all-a4518016.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,f04713a37a56bbe675085cdd1f48406eb3c25f629c0b292e37de101086fe4d7b,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Still, it does give you more time to contemplate the message in question.  As he careered through a red light â tongue waggling as he glanced over his shoulder â and I waited for the green, I could really burrow down into whether I found his âmotherâsâ verdict faintly incestuous, or simply a self-deprecating assessment of âherâ own parenting.  Cycling has skyrocketed, and our roads have been invaded by rogue cyclists giving the rest of us a bad name. Though this chump was remarkable, in the grand scheme of my new summer project â an unofficial taxonomy of Londonâs more pestilent bike users â he barely registers. Saddle up: youâre in for a wild ride.  Before you start with me â my issue is not with the newbies trying to avoid public transport. I do not wish to sound like the two-wheeled version of one of those gym elitists who greets Januaryâs ephemeral, New-Year-resolution zealots with an eye roll and perhaps a (gentle, deniable) shoulder barge by the dumbbells.  No, novice cyclists are welcome â they tend to be more fluent in the rules of the road than the old guard. The latter, though, appear to be acting out this year, perhaps at the thrill of a whole new audience in their pop-up cycle lanes.  Quotidian offences include running red lights; shouting at pedestrians for stepping onto zebra crossings; bombing it up the pavement towards some nanas at the bus stop; and undertaking wildly. Recently I have found myself closing my eyes when I see one do the latter â I canât help it â there-by becoming a bad cyclist myself, though not as bad as those with earphones plugged in. Voluntarily disabling one of your senses as you take Vauxhall junction at a clip seems like folly to me, but maybe Iâm just really boring.  If they canât keep pace I hear, âYouâre fast arenât you... for a girl,â as I leave them in the dust  The gender split of the aforementioned trends one way (guess which?) but there is a separate tribe that, in my field research, is entirely male.  Overtaking one, especially on an incline, seems to trigger a red mist. They will put pedal to metal in order to veer into oncoming traffic, overtake you and restore the universeâs rightful equilibrium (man first! woman second!). At which point they will slow down once more and you will find yourself cycling up their rear wheel (not a euphemism).  When you later overtake again at a more opportune point, theyâll be triggered and the whole thing repeats. If they canât keep pace, they may sling a comment. Recently: âYouâre fast, arenât youâ. The words â...for a girlâ may have followed, except Iâd overtaken by then. And ânice legsâ. Thanks! Iâve always found them useful for leaving you in the dust.  Still, this bad behaviour is of more interest to cyclists than anyone else, largely because, frankly, most non-cyclists would deny the existence of any âgoodâ cyclists altogether. Partly because we can sound pretty smug â no comment â but also because there are too many committing other everyday offences such as screaming at pedestrians.  Even the most sanctimonious cyclist behaves badly occasionally â again, no comment â but now the stakes are especially high.  Weâre on the verge of a revolution: in our new Covid world, Londonâs roads could be reorganised to accommodate more bikes (good news for the air) and cycling badly invalidates our cause. If cars canât mount the pavement or run red lights as grannies cross, cyclists shouldnât either.  Letâs not mess this up.

Bank officials have been rightly concerned about what will happen with jobs once state-sponsored furloughing comes to an end in October. The steady drumbeat of job losses here - WHSmith being the latest to announce - suggests a major wave of layoffs is underway.  Traders woke to grim news on the labour market with the KPMG/REC survey on jobs finding recruiters reported the steepest rise in the number of people seeking work since the financial crisis. Companies have been laying off staff who had been previously furloughed at a rapid rate, resulting in more than four-fifths of recruitment consultants seeing more jobseekers coming onto their books. The Recruitment & Employment Confederation said the increase in numbers of temps available was the biggest in 23 years of the survey running. Even Arsenal is cutting 55 backroom staff despite securing a place in Europe next season.  However, other survey data on corporate activity suggests there are signs of a recovery across the board, albeit from a very low level.

But some people don't have to wear coverings for various reasons - like if they have breathing problems or another form of disability which would make a mask difficult to put on.  Many of these issues are not easy for other people to spot straight away. To help people with these conditions carry on their daily lives as usual, charity Hidden Disabilities has created a sunflower badge to let shop workers and others know that they are exempt from face coverings.  Here we look at the badges and who is eligible for one.  Who does not have to wear a face covering?  There are a range of people who are exempt for professional reasons from wearing face coverings, like police officers and paramedics.  But the Government has said that respiratory problems and other disabilities are a ""reasonable excuse"" not to wear coverings in shops and on public transport.  How can you show that you're exempt?  You don't have to carry any badge or other written proof that says you're exempt from face coverings.  But if you're concerned about being stopped, there are a number of options available.  You could make yourself a home-made card that says you're exempt.  There is a Government-issued badge you can use either in printed form or on your phone, which is available for download here. Transport for London has also made an exemption card, which can be used on TfL services and with other transport organisations. Both are free.  Alternatively, you could buy a plastic card from the Hidden Disabilities charity for 55p. The cards are also free to pick up from Sainsbury's and Tesco stores, as well as some other supermarkets.  The Hidden Disabilities website says: ""Businesses who are members of the scheme are aware of our card and provide support, help, assistance or simply a little more time to those wearing the Hidden Disabilities Sunflower.  ""However, please note that shops and public transport can still refuse you entry if you are not wearing a face covering.""",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/sunflower-badges-hidden-disabilities-a4518181.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,597d6d472cb8aeceb7d1e91c6ac53a1308630750eaf86b1b38213fa628cf7d1c,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Lila (Ritu Arya) discovers that The Handler (Kate Walsh) ordered for her parents to be killed by Five (Aidan Gallagher), and just as it looks as if the Hargreeves family will finally have a happy ending, The Handler appears and shoots them all â seconds before she is killed by the final remaining Swede.  As he lays dying, Five uses his power to go back in time just seconds to save his family, disarming the Handler before she is shot dead by the Swede (Kris Holden-Ried) . Lila escapes the murder scene by reaching for the time travelling suitcase, while the Hargreeves return to 2nd April 2019 â the day after the original apocalypse.  While it appears things in the mansion back to normal superficially, the family are left speechless when Reginald (Colm Feore) appears alive and well, and tell them that this is not their home - rather, this is the home of the Sparrow Academy.

At the very beginning of the first series, we were told that 43 women around the world gave birth at the same time â begging the question: âWhat happened to the other 36 children that Reginald didnât raise?â The Sparrow Academy could be made up of other individuals with distinctive powers.  The comic book series, written by My Chemical Romance star Gerard Way, also points to who these figures could be.  While theyâre yet to be namechecked officially, Way has revealed the fourth volume in the series will be titled The Sparrow Academy.  Discussing the book, he explained: â[It] deals with a very big reveal in the Umbrella Academy universe, something that had been secret for a long time.  âAnd our siblings learn a lot about what was happening behind the scenes, as well as discovering the true nature of some characters that have been with them since the beginning.â  Way continued to Forbes: âThe series finally starts to answer the question: âWhat about the other babies born on that day, in that moment?â  âThe Umbrella Academy siblings are not alone in the world anymore.â  What happened to Lila and is she now part of the Sparrows?  Lila was one of the more surprising newcomers in this season; having been introduced as a fellow impatient of Diegoâs (David CastaÃ±eda) in the psychiatric ward, it soon transpired she was working as a double-agent for The Handler, her adoptive mother.  Looking to seek revenge on Five for killing her real parents, Lilaâs world was rocked when Five revealed that he had been tasked by The Handler to commit the murders â with the Handler looking to steal Lilaâs powers of superpower mimicry for herself.  The Handler was murdered by the Swede hitman before Lila could truly confront her about the situation, and used her opportunity to escape the oncoming massacre by grabbing a time-travelling briefcase.  Lilaâs existence proves there are likely several others out there with powers similar to those in the Academy, so itâs not beyond the realms of possibility she could be part of the new Sparrow Academy.  Actor Ritu Arya has been deliberately cagey as to where her character then ends up.  âBless her. Sheâs not having a good ride, is she?â she told Refinery29. âFirstly, sheâs devastated - it doesnât matter what sheâs just heard about her mum.  âYour mum is murdered in front of your eyes. I canât think of anything more horrific. So she just thinks, âI need to get the hell out of here.ââ  Will there be a third season of the Umbrella Academy?  Netflix is yet to confirm whether we will see another chapter of The Umbrella Academy, but itâs clear from the season two cliffhanger, plus the upcoming release of the next volume by Way, that thereâs far more of the story yet to be told.  The Umbrella Academy is also hugely popular with audiences, with the first episode of the first series having been watched by 45 million households, so if the second series has the same level of success a third season would be a no-brainer.  Showrunner Steve Blackman is evidently gearing up for more, telling Inverse that the third season âis going to be very complicatedâ for the Umbrella Academy siblings.  âThey donât have their home anymore, their father is alive and well - which he shouldnât be - so needless to say there will be more destructive family madness,â he explained.",https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/umbrella-academy-lila-sparrow-a4515361.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,3648b3c07ca7ff4409199acf09bd7467f24c8243b4169a94ec95ee975eb305ae,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

They meet at a picnic on a cloudy day in Clapton Pond as the UK is gearing up for the EU referendum. The narrator has just moved to London from China and doesnât know what the word referendum means, let alone Brexit. The man who becomes her boyfriend catches her eye because he is picking elderflowers and sheâs never seen a man take an interest in flowers before.  Their subsequent relationship is based on arguments, from her pronunciation of words to philosophical concepts such as whether his penis is part of his body and the meaning of Barthesâ Discourses (to which the novelâs title refers). Itâs as pretentious as it sounds, but redeemed by moments of humour, giving the book an intellectual rom com feel. At one point she grows frustrated with him while heâs asleep â how dare he not wake up so she can nitpick?  The couple donât have names â author Xiaolu Guo has form with this. In her 2007 novel, A Concise Chinese-English Dictionary for Lovers (shortlisted for the Orange Prize), the boyfriend character is nameless. In both that novel and here it is a deliberate move to show how rootless they are. As Brexit rumbles on in the background, the narrator is trying to find a place she belongs and her boyfriend â who is German but grew up in Australia â is feeling claustrophobic in his London flatshare.  A Loverâs Discourse picks up on familiar themes for Guo, a Granta Best Young British Novelist and a 2019 Booker Prize judge. Her 2017 memoir, Once Upon a Time in the East, details how she grew up feeling alienated from her family in rural China, went to study at the Beijing Film Academy and moved to London in 2002. Here, through zooming in on a womanâs intimate thoughts about her relationship, she discusses cultural misunderstandings as well as why we gravitate towards being in relationships. The narrator here feels no connection to her family and settles on London because sheâs offered a place at Kingâs College London. The subject of her PhD is on a place in China where every villager works reproducing Western paintings. Guoâs father was a landscape ink painter and there are thought-provoking sections on the Western colonisation of culture.  The story is split into eight short sections, named after the compass points, as well as down, up, left and right. The narrator travels to China, Australia, Germany, Italy and Purley on Thames, desperately looking for a place to belong to. When she becomes pregnant this need becomes more urgent. English is not Guoâs first language but her style makes an impact â she writes in short sentences, almost like haikus, making it feel abrupt and unsentimental, with lots of direct speech. Each chapter is introduced with a fragment of conversation that is then repeated in that narrative which seems unnecessary.The narrator shares her misunderstandings of language, which are meant to be funny but end up just making her look stupid â an invitation to a Liverpool versus Arsenal football match, for example throws her. She thought Arsenal was just a weapons factory and she is mystified by her boyfriend describing himself as a WASP. As the title suggests, it is more discourse than plot-driven novel, which at times feels leaden with too much analysis of emotions. But overall, the impression is of a story told with charm that will leave you in a ponderous mood.

Daisy Johnson, whose debut novel, Everything Under, was shortlisted for the 2018 Man Booker Prize, opens her new psychological drama with July and September (named after their birth months, having arrived just 10 months apart) being uprooted and taken to start a new life somewhere seemingly unknown.  An older sibling through and through, September is ferociously protective of her younger sister, frequently doing her bidding and warding off bullies. July, for her part, dutifully trails behind, copying her sisterâs choices and mirroring her actions. Despite being in their teenage years, the sisters share a room, finish each otherâs sentences and sometimes communicate with the single blink of an eye.  But Johnsonâs exhilarating second novel goes deeper into their relationship, exploring the complexities of sisterhood and laying bare a bond forged in childhood, which is being tested by the strains of adolescence. It soon becomes clear that there is a darker side to their relationship, and Septemberâs love for July becomes stifling. Rather than moving apart, their closeness, often tinged with rivalry, jealousy and spite, seems only to grow, and they remain worryingly childlike, cutting themselves off from their peers.  For the most part, July steers us through their haunting story, recalling the recent events which are shaping her familyâs future, and detailing their past. Johnson skips between stories of sisterly kindness and disturbed acts, such as self-harm, frequently catching the reader off-guard with a sudden, vicious exchange or weighty revelation.  Thereâs a third wheel too â in the form of their adoring but tormented mother, Sheela. A writer and illustrator, Sheela has made her living creating picture books based on her daughters, who have long thought they had no need for anyone else. But after their toughest moment, which sees tragedy strike, it is their mother who literally steers them to safety.  Occasional chapters reveal Sheelaâs predicament, and it is here that Johnsonâs prose is at its most haunting and poetic, as she describes Sheelaâs depressive episodes, tense relationship with the girlsâ now-absent father and the Settle House, where they have come to live. Settle House is a kind of gothic fantasy; not a new home as the sisters initially think, but one which turns out to be an intrinsic part of their past. With its crawl spaces between walls, a mysterious pantry and cobwebs everywhere, all of which adds to the mounting tension,  Sheela feels a kinship with the ramshackle building, likening herself to its empty, foreboding structure. The unspeakable thing that happens is, of course, revealed in the closing chapters, and Johnsonâs powerful storytelling means the moment creeps up on you, catching you unaware even after hours of wide-eyed reading without moving an inch. A masterful follow-up to her debut, Johnsonâs novel is quietly terrifying and certainly an apt read for 2020.

Please log in Register with your social account or click here to log in I would like to receive trends and interviews from fashion, lifestyle to travel every week, by email Update newsletter preferences  How prescient and timely. Three years in the research and writing, Bradley Garrettâs intriguing book investigates âpreppersâ, those building armoured retreats in the expectation of societal collapse brought about by war, disaster or â yes â a pandemic. This is a tartly thoughtful work, by turns witty and philosophical, with an undercurrent of anger at the way we are governed and the commodification of existential fear. Garrett refers to those who make a living building and selling bunkers â from simple shelters to palatial underground âgeoscraperâ apartments â as âdread merchantsâ.  The bunker dates back to prehistory, arguably to the first settlements. As soon as a group occupies one place, it becomes a target and must fortify itself from attack. But the big booms in bunker building all came in the last 110 years, during the world wars, the Cold War, and our current era of apocalyptic anxiety.  The biggest bunker builders are governments. In the 20th century, broadly speaking, continental European societies built bunkers for the populace (Switzerland has a bunker space for every citizen, plus tourists), while American and British governments built them for themselves. When the first plane hit the World Trade Center, congressmen and women were immediately evacuated to a 56,000 sq metre underground facility in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Garrett, a geographer, ethnographer, academic and urban explorer, kicks off the book with his own illegal exploration of the UKâs Central Government War Headquarters near Bath, big enough for 4,000 people.  Next come religious organisations gearing up for the end times â not just wacko cults like David Koreshâs Branch Davidians in Waco, but the Mormons too. Then there are individual preppers, ranging from the super-rich supposedly building redoubts in New Zealand to âlone-wolfâ types packing armoured âbug-outâ vehicles with weapons and supplies for the Aussie outback or American boondocks.  In between are the communities unified by fear of a tyrannical âNew World Orderâ, a natural disaster brought about by a rogue planet, or somesuch. Thereâs good money to be made flogging military vehicles or long-life food stockpiles to preppers, but commercial bunker builders seem to be hucksters for the most part. Of the various facilities Garrett visits only one seems to live up to what it promises in terms of both protection and enough comfort to stop residents going mad. This is the luxurious Survival Condo in a former Kansas missile silo, which includes a swimming pool and supermarket as well as remote controlled surface machine guns. Entry-level units cost $1.5m.  Of course, the preppers are mostly mad already, deluded by warped conspiracy theories or by racist or religious paranoia. But they are also, in one sense, right. The mechanisms of international collaboration that would best avert war or mitigate disasters and pandemics have been eroded. Most governments and elites are now more interested in protecting themselves and their wealth than the wider population. Garrett, a low-grade prepper himself, argues it makes sense to have some degree of self-reliance and a survival strategy.  He writes pacily, bringing to vivid life a gallery of survivalist wingnuts, conmen and evangelists, and smoothly unpacking a new vocabulary of âhardened architectureâ and DUMBS (deep underground military shelters). Occasionally heâs a bit too keen to flash his intellectual knickers with references to Foucault and Heidegger. But his central message of the fragility of societies â how quickly after a catastrophic event we might descend into anarchy, vigilantism, and cannibalism - is chillingly simple. The question is: would staying alive locked in an armoured box really be preferable?

Forecasters say that London is braced for temperatures higher than 30C until Tuesday â with tomorrow seeing the highest.  Much of the south will see the mercury soar higher than the Caribbean, with highs of 33C (91F) expected in Jamaica and 29C (84F) in Barbados.  Meanwhile, the heatwave will see at least 30C ""widely"" throughout the UK, forecasters added.

But the days will still feel incredibly warm with the mercury hovering around the low to mid-30s, he added.  The heatwave will then come to a ""dramatic"" end with thunderstorms set to hit in the middle of next week.  Mr Madge said that the UK does not get temperatures of around 36C to 37C every year and that these temperatures are expected in isolated locations like London and the southeast.  He said: ""The heat is going to build quite suddenly over the next 48 hours. Given the weather that we have had today it is going to be a steep climb to the hot temperatures on Friday.

The exclusive Ipsos MORI poll for the Evening Standard showed support for the way the Chancellor has dealt with coronavirus has remained steady, with 60 per cent saying he is doing well, and 13 per cent badly.  The findings are almost exactly the same figures as June, despite the continued criticism faced by the Government.  They compare to Boris Johnson on 43 per cent doing well, and 43 per cent badly, down from 45/42 in June.  The nation is also split over Health Secretary Matt Hancock, with 38 per cent saying he is doing well, and the same number badly. His results were lower than in June when he scored 42/37.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is in positive territory, with 31 per cent saying he is doing well, and 14 per cent badly, 30 per cent saying neither well nor badly, and 17 per cent not knowing who he is.  The only prominent figure featured in the poll who matched or possibly beat Mr Sunakâs ratings was Chief Medical Officer, Professor Chris Whitty, on 62 to 13.  There are also signs that backing for Mr Sunak may be becoming less firm, as the furlough scheme starts to be scaled back, with 23 per cent saying he is doing âvery wellâ and 37 per cent âfairly wellâ, compared with 29/31 respectively in June.  Gideon Skinner, head of political research at Ipsos MORI, said: âRishi Sunak is one of the biggest winners from the publicâs desire to see strong government action to support those affected by the coronavirus, with positive ratings from both sides of the political spectrum.  âIt is, though, a bigger step to be seen as a PM-in-waiting, and public opinion is not there yet, but heâs starting from a better position than most other contenders in recent years.â  Overall, 42 per cent of adults say the Government is doing well with its handling of the crisis, and 40 per cent badly, compared with 40/44 in June.  The Conservatives have also stretched their lead over Labour to eight points, on 45 per cent (up two) to 37 per cent (down one) on June.  The Chancellorâs speedy rise through the political ranks is also highlighted with the poll finding that 36 per cent agree that he has what it takes to be a good prime minister, just five years after becoming an MP, with 22 per cent disagreeing, and 27 per cent neither agreeing nor disagreeing.  Mr Johnson gets 45 per cent backing on this question, with 43 per cent disagreeing and Sir Keir is similar to the Chancellor, with 38 per cent agreeing and 24 per cent disagreeing.  The country is still deeply divided over Mr Johnson, with 47 per cent saying they are satisfied with the way he is doing his job, and 48 per cent dissatisfied, giving him a net satisfaction rating of minus one, the same as June.  Four in 10 think âcompetentâ is an accurate description of the Government, with 44 per cent disagreeing, though this is far better than during the autumn Brexit shambles when it was 22/66 respectively.  Nearly half the country does not believe Labour is ready to form the next government, the poll found.  It also showed Sir Keirâs satisfaction rating dipping on June. The survey found 47 per cent disagreed that the party was ready to become the next Government, with 29 saying it was.  The figures highlight the mountain Labour has to climb for Sir Keir to get into No10, although it was still the partyâs best result since February 2015, after the Corbyn years which left it so far from power.  Just under one in three say there would be chaos if Labour was elected at the next election, with 47 per cent disagreeing, an almost reversal of the figures under Jeremy Corbyn in September.  Ipsos MORI interviewed 1,019 adults across Great Britain by phone between July 30 and August 4. Data are weighted.

2020-08-06 13:22:09.773109,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 09:45:04 GMT",Revealed: The explosive headlines Selling Sunset series 3 will explore,"With its high production values, glossy vistas of stunning LA mansions and over-the-top in-fighting, Selling Sunset has become one of Netflixâs most addictive reality offerings.  Following the employees of high-end real estate firm The Oppenheim Group at work and off duty, it harks back to the glory days of US reality TV (itâs no surprise that the show shares an executive producer with Noughties hit The Hills).  As the showâs profile has risen, the antics of the cast have started to hit the headlines ahead of new episodes - making it easier for fans to pinpoint exactly what we can expect from future series.  So, in the same way that a glance back at the Kardashian-Jennersâ social media feeds can help you make an educated guess at what each new season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians will have in store, sleuthing through US gossip sites like People and Us Weekly can give us a pretty good idea of what the Oppenheim Group gang will be up to in series three.  With weddings, divorces and celebrity cameos on the cards, hereâs what we can expect from the new episodes (naturally, youâll find potential spoilers belowâ¦)  Chrishellâs divorce  Chrishell Stause often alluded to her husband Justin Hartley, who has appeared in This Is Us, in Selling Sunset's first two series, but sadly the actor filed for divorce last November - bang in the middle of filming for season three - citing irreconcilable differences. Itâs safe to assume, then, that the fallout from their split will form a major storyline this time around.  Speaking on the RealiTea podcast, she admitted that it was difficult to work on the show during such a tumultuous time in her personal life, adding that she will find it hard to watch the series back.  âItâs an embarrassing, humiliating type of thing to go through without cameras and without people judging you, so I just hope people are gentle when they watch,â she said.  The media interest in the split has also been another recent source of contention between Chrishell and on-screen nemesis Christine Quinn, with the former tweeting out a furious rebuttal after the latter discussed the break-up in an interview.  âI just learned Christine is giving press âinformationâ about my divorce,â Chrishell wrote.  âLet me be VERY clear. She knows absolutely nothing about the situation and is obviously desperate to gain attention by doing so. Anything from her is either a complete lie or total conjecture on her part.â  Christine ties the knot  (Netflix)  After Maryâs wedding (and the endless discussions over whether Davina would be able to attend after incurring the wrath of her fiance) dominated series two, it looks like Christineâs spectacularly OTT nuptials will appear in the third season.  Our favourite anti-heroine tied the knot with businessman Christian (yes, Christine and Christianâ¦) Richards in December - and the official photos, published in People magazine earlier this year, are a truly wild ride.  Turning bridal tradition upside down, Christine dressed in black - with a pair of red Louboutins - for the occasion and arrived at her venue, a cathedral in downtown Los Angeles, in a Victorian horse-drawn carriage before walking down the aisle to Ava Maxâs Sweet But Psycho. There was plenty of fake snow, too - and a pair of black swans...  This being a structured reality show, her castmates were naturally in attendance, presumably to detonate a few gossip bombshells on the brideâs big day.  â¦ and believes she had coronavirus at the wedding  You read that correctly. Ahead of series three, Christine revealed that she was feeling dreadful on the day of her wedding - and retroactively reckons that she was in fact suffering from Covid-19.  âI was really, really sick on my wedding day,â she told Goss Chats. âI actually had, which I now know, was corona.  âI got really sick in late December and we were travelling. I was sick for about a month when we were filming.  âI couldnât even have a bachelorette party, I was so bummed about that. That time was such a high but a low at the same time.â  Yikes. Given that the coronavirus outbreak is thought to have started in China in late December, itâs worth taking Christineâs comments with a liberal pinch of salt...

The $44 million house is off the market  (Netflix)  The infamous $44 million home in Hollywood Hills that featured in the previous season, which boasted 20,000 square feet, a home cinema, an infinity pool and a handful of hot tubs, was peak property goals - but the agents seemed to struggle to find a buyer (no doubt thanks to that hefty price tag). However, it seems that Jason Oppenheim managed to pull off the sale, according to co-star Amanza Smith.  âHe sold it to a couple,â she explained. âI was upset because we were kind of hoping that the really handsome single bachelor would buy it so we could go and hang out at the pool.â Weâre sure the producers were hoping for a similar scenario, too.

Please log in  The original Whitehall spy lair where the inspiration for James Bondâs boss M briefed secret agents on thwarting the deadly threat from Germany and Bolshevik Russia is for sale.  The bombproof former headquarters of the Secret Intelligence Service â as well as a pied-Ã -terre used by its founder Sir Mansfield Smith-Cumming â could become the ultimate home for a very wealthy 007 enthusiast.  The top three storeys of the building where the Bond myth was born have gone on sale for Â£5.5 million following conversion into a spectacular penthouse apartment.  Legendary spymaster Sir Mansfield moved the new espionage service to Whitehall Court in 1911 shortly after it was founded in response to scares about plots being fomented in Germany against the British Empire.  Its work during the First World War was considered so vital to national security that the eaves of the Portland stone building were reinforced with steel-encased timber beams and hardened flooring to protect it from Zeppelin raids â features that remain to this day.  The eaves of the Portland stone building are reinforced with steel-encased timber beams  The former âlabyrinthineâ warren of offices â so secret that they did not officially exist â was also where real-life âQâ gadget masters developed âtoysâ such as poison ink pens and bombs disguised as dead rats to be used by agents in the field. It even has a cameo role in the forthcoming Bond movie No Time To Die in which Daniel Craig parks his silver Aston Martin outside the building.  The 4,144 sq ft penthouse is located over the eighth to 10th floors with one of Whitehall Courtâs distinctive cupolas providing extra living spaces. The eighth floor has the main reception room opening onto a roof terrace with views over Whitehall. On the ninth floor of the penthouse is the master bedroom suite and two other guest bedrooms.  The 10th floor contains the kitchen and dining room, while the cupola has been turned into a two-level living space with a smaller reception room on the lower level and a library on the top floor. The buyer will occupy the same space where the former Royal  A legendary spymaster  The navy officer signed his memos and reports in green ink simply as C, practices still retained by the head of MI6.  The custom of using only a single letter as a signature was adopted by Bond author Ian Fleming, when he created the character M, most famously played by Dame Judi Dench.  In his SIS memos Smith-Cumming wrote: âBeen here five weeks. Absolutely cut off from everyone while here and cannot give my address out or be telephoned to under my own name. One of my colleagues asked me if I should object to his moving into a flat next door, but I told him that I thought it would interfere with my privacy [and secrecy] in my own flat and I told him not to go forward with any such scheme.â  In December 1919 MI6 left Whitehall Court and moved its offices to a house in Melbury Road, Holland Park, although Smith-Cumming continued to use Whitehall Court as his personal office and official residence up until his death in 1923 at the age of 64.  Gary Hersham, founding director of Beauchamp Estates, which is handling the sale, said: âWho doesnât love the excitement and glamour of the Secret Services, spies, gadgets and James Bond? âWhitehall Court, with its Blue Plaque denoting the founding home of the British secret service is in the heart of the government quarter and within it this unique penthouse, located in the eaves of the building, helps to shine a spotlight on the thrilling history of the secret service and the 007-style agents.â",https://www.standard.co.uk/homesandproperty/james-bond-whitehall-spy-home-for-sale-a4516911.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,fd558526d0afe0c7b9a0db85132eb90bc511363c3e65f533279ab04a77b37871,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The research, by Imperial College London, its sister NHS trust and Ipsos MORI, found that infection rates fell between June 19 and July 8 but there was an âincreased infection intensity in and near Londonâ.  The REACT-1 study is the largest in the country, with almost 160,000 people agreeing to undertake a random nasal and throat test sent to them at home, to check for antigens showing the presence of Covid-19.  A total of 123 positive samples were found from 159,199 tests, a rate of 0.077 per cent. This is down from 0.13 per cent in May, when 120,620 tests detected 159 cases.  But 81 per cent of positive tests in the latest period were in people who had reported no symptoms, such as a new, continuous cough, high temperature or change in taste or smell, either on the day of the test or in the previous week.  This compares with 69 per cent of asymptomatic cases in the studyâs first period, from May 1 to June 1.  In London, the latest prevalence rate was 0.15 per cent, with 23 positive tests from 15,750 samples.  The lack of symptoms is a concern as it means people will have the ability to spread the virus without realising they are infectious. The report said asymptomatic people were âa potential source of ongoing transmissionâ.  However they may have developed symptoms subsequently. The swab test does not show how infectious they were.

A study, conducted by research unit AlphaWise at US bank Morgan Stanley, found around 34 per cent of British white-collar workers are back in the office, compared to 83 per cent of French office staff.  Britain also lagged behind the other major European economies on office returns, with around three-quarters of German, Italian and Spanish workers having returned to the pre-pandemic commuting routine, according to the study.  It found workers in London were far more likely to still be working five days a week from home than those working similar jobs in other European capitals, including Berlin, Paris, Rome, and Madrid.

Employees returning to their desks is now at the âdiscretionâ of employers, and advice to avoid all unnecessary public transport journeys has been dropped in England.  But poll findings from Portland Communications, seen by the Standard last month, suggested that one third of London workers will not be back in the office by Christmas, with eight out of 10 saying they feared returning to their desks.

The ECB spoke with the first-class counties yesterday, revealing that a minimum deficit of Â£106m is expected in this financial year.  Some counties are angry with the governing body's claim yesterday that the county game represents just 1% of the ECB's value.  This leaves counties facing a potential cut in funding from the ECB and gearing up to have to make further budget cuts of their own.  They are waiting to hear more from the ECB on the consequences of the pandemic, but it is expected that a quarter of the governing body's 379 employees will be made redundant.  This has been an expensive summer for the ECB with commercial revenue down, no fans in the ground and the need to create a biosecure bubble to make cricket safe.  The Hundred, the start of which was delayed by 12 months, is set to have budget cuts but will remain safe.",https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/cricket/ecb-redundancies-coronavirus-crisis-a4518166.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,7118586ab6f19b8f6c49f99fab6cdc8f9feabee0f56613df205d32dac6976ba4,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Instead, it would be more apropos to say that summerâs in a socially-distanced quasi-state of swing.  While 2020 may be the weirdest year on record, during the next few sun-kissed months a familiar old trend is coming back to pay her respects; the old scarf-folded-in-half-and-wrapped-around-your-chest, more commonly referred to as the scarf top.  Made famous by Destinyâs Child, Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera circa early 2000s, the scarf top was a prevalent noughties staple. The aughts' objective was to flash as much flesh as possible while lacquering up your lips with Cliniqueâs Juicy Tubes, painting your eyelids baby blue and watching re-runs of The OC, but this year's decree of how to style out the hybrid has taken on a more modest form.  When the Instarati's go-to brand Realisation Par launched in 2015, it burst onto the scene selling a selection of so-called 'handkerchiefs', all of which were styled as scarf tops; folded in half and tied at the back. The slinky offerings promptly sold out but didn't fail to leave their mark on the fashion crowd. For the bustier babes among us, the scarf top may not be the most forgiving of styles, but for those in possession of more modest torsos, this may well be the summer style for you.  Fashion platform Lyst has noted that searches for scarves have increased 15 per cent in the month of July, with silk and printed scarves being the most wanted. Searches for âscarf topâ in particular have increased 37 per cent month-on-month.  The fashion set sanctioned way of how to shmoulder in a scarf top (smouldering with the shoulders, of course) is to rock yours with a pair of 90s jeans or, if you're yearning to channel professional skimpy siren Bella Hadid, then trial it with just bikini bottoms for a prance around the garden.

2020-08-06 13:22:12.450631,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 09:22:19 GMT",What is Reels? Here's everything you need to know about Instagram's new TikTok rival platform,"The short-form video app TikTok has a cool 800 million monthly active users but Instagram is still ahead with its 1 billion+ people that log into the account every month to send stories, post to the feed, and generally lurk online.  Now Instagram is coming for TikTokâs crown with its own short-form video feature, named Reels which launched this week in the US and UK.  Reels has been in the works for over a year, with the platform initially testing the new Instagram feature in Brazil last November. The idea for Reels is a new feature in the appâs Camera which will allow you to record 15-second videos, set them to music, add gifs and text and send them out onto the platform in no time.  âWe think Reels is a really big part of the next chapter of Instagram,â says the platformâs product director Tessa Lyons-Laing. âThereâs no other platform that brings together entertainment, friends, interests and creators the way that we do and we think Reels is going to be an amazing way for the community to express themselves, connect and be entertained.â  According to Instagram, in the last month, 45 per cent of videos on the feed were 15 seconds or under, so thereâs a clear demand for this type of content on the platform. Hereâs what you need to know about the new feature.  How to make Reels and where to find them  To make a Reels video, slide over to the camera section of the app and swipe through the options at the bottom, e.g Boomerang and Layout till you get to Reels. Thereâs a variety of tools you can use to make your video a hit, such as a soundtrack.  Choose a trending or popular song or your own audio, a handy feature allows you to select the right part of the song you want to play during the video â remember you only have 15 seconds to work with.  Thereâs time controls to slow down or speed up the frame, as well as all those Instagram filters you know and love â the green screen one is particularly cool as it allows you to change your background.  Want to feature different frames in the video? The Align tool means you can line up with the frame of the last shot and then start going with the next section.  During experiments, Reels would live only in Stories but the testers wanted a more permanent place to showcase their creations. As a result, you can post Reels directly to feed, Stories, or send them via direct message. Thereâs going to be a big focus on Reels clips in Explore too, giving the videos their own space. Just as TikTok has an algorithmic feed, âFor Youâ, the Reels section in Instagram Explore will work in a similar way, serving up videos the platform thinks youâll like depending on the content you engage with, as well as a space for trending and videos chosen by local curators.  Whoâs going to be making Reels?  As part of the launch for the new service, Instagram has reportedly been trying to lure popular TikTok creators over to the new feature, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal, even offering hundreds of thousands of dollars in some cases.  Instagram says it's in talks with a lot of big emerging creators, though it wonât specify who at the moment. In particular, the platform says it hopes this will be an opportunity to break the next generation of artists, the next Charli DâAmelio or Loren Gray, if you will.  Already, some of the creators who have been experimenting with Reels include Little Mix, Tom Daley, Chinenye Ezeudu from Sex Education and Charli XCX. One account that Lyons-Liang recommends checking out is Hydroman_333, who creates underwater dancing videos.  To win over the new generation, the next big feature Instagram is working on for Reels will be creator monetisation, so branded content and the like. Lyons-Liang says this is a âpriorityâ for the platform, which should certainly help to sweeten the platform switch.  What about Lasso?  This isnât the first time that Facebook has experimented with the short-form video space. Earlier this year it shut down an early iteration of this, a separate app named Lasso, that was expected to capitalise on the TikTok trend.  So whatâs different about Reels? For a start, Reels is an integrated feature in Instagram, instead of a separate app. Lyons-Liang said the team used Lasso to learn about the types of tools creators wanted and things like trending content, which have all been put to good use in Instagram. âWe often place multiple bets across the family of apps so we can meet the needs and wants of the community,â she explains.  It seems Lasso was a bet that didnât pay off for the family.  It's definitely an interesting time for Instagram to launch Reels. Though TikTok has been exceptionally popular, it's been at the centre of a few controversies from being banned in India, to a potential ban in the US, mainly surrounding its parent company ByteDance which is based in China, and the concern that the Chinese government could demand to see TikTok user data. ByteDance denies this would happen, saying it keeps its data centres outside of its home country, but given the concerns around the privacy of the app, it could be a prime opportunity for Instagram to swoop in and pick up those detractors.  When can I download Reels?  As Reels is part of Instagram, you can access it now as long as you live in one of the 50 countries where it is launching, including the US, UK, India, Brazil, France, Germany and Japan.  Once youâve updated the app to the newest version you can get creating yourself.",https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/reels-video-social-media-platform-instagram-a4518161.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,e337b2fa051efb3a087af926e0508a99926dbd7c3aa6cf2767e47684487ffbce,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

As many as 226,000 people died in the bombings and their aftermath. The bombs also brought an end to the Second World War, with Japan surrendering on August 15.  Anniversary commemorations are low-key this year due to ongoing coronavirus restrictions in Japan, but a memorial was held in Hiroshima with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.  But what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and what were the events that led to the attacks?  US-Japan tensions  Tensions between the US and Japan had been growing for decades before the Second World War. Japan had occupied parts of eastern China, which led to a war between the two countries in 1937.  The US and other Western countries halted exports - including vital fuel oil - to Japan in an attempt to discourage it from further expansion. Japan saw this as an aggressive act.  The countries tried to negotiate for Japan to retreat from China and the US to start exporting fuel again in late 1941, but could not agree on terms.  Pearl Harbor  Japan launched an air attack on the US air base of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii on December 7, 1941, killing 2,403 American service people and wounding a further 1,178.  The attack was later judged a war crime because it took place unannounced and while peace talks were ongoing. US president Franklin Roosevelt called it ""a day which will live in infamy"".  Both countries declared war on each other shortly after the attack.  The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki  The US and Japan had been at war for nearly four years, since April 1941. The bloody and fiercely-fought conflict in the Pacific had cost millions of Japanese and Americans their lives already.  The war in Europe had finished nearly two months earlier, in May 1945, after Germany's unconditional surrender. The US was preparing for a land invasion of Japan, which would have been very hard-fought. At least 500,000 Americans alone would have been likely to die, according to US government estimates at the time.  At the same time, the US had been developing to make nuclear bombs since the late 1930s. The bombs were ready by summer 1945.  The Allies called for Japan to surrender in late July 1945, threatening ""complete and utter destruction"" otherwise.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki were chosen as targets for their military and industrial importance, as they supplied the Japanese armed forces with weapons and other military technologies.  A uranium bomb nicknamed Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima on August 6. The city was devastated: tens of thousands died almost immediately and as many as 146,000 died in the three months after the attack.  Many more would go on to suffer from cancers and other forms of illness brought on by the radiation from the bomb. Huge numbers of buildings were completely destroyed or damaged.  Japanese authorities were reportedly aware another strike could follow Hiroshima, but decided to endure it rather than surrender.  The next attack, a plutonium bomb nicknamed Fat Man, fell on Nagasaki on August 9. As many as 80,000 people died. In both cities, the vast majority of people who died were civilians.  The aftermath  Japan surrendered on August 15, six days after the attack on Nagasaki. Both cities were rebuilt after the war, although Hiroshima was hit with a typhoon in September 1945 that also caused great destruction.  Around 145,000 people who survived either of the bombings - called hibakusha in Japanese - were still alive in March 2019, according to the Japanese government. Memorials have been put up in both cities to the victims of the bombing.  Debate continues over the ethics of the attack, which remain the only nuclear bombs used in war. Some say they brought an earlier end to the Second World War, which would have led to many more casualties on both sides if the US had invaded Japan.  Others say that the use of nuclear bombs in war is inherently unethical and some labelled the attacks a war crime. Others argued there were more peaceful ways to end the war than either nuclear bombing or an invasion, such as a military blockade on Japan.  The bombs cast a long shadow over the second half of the twentieth century, with the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union dominated by concerns that either country could attack the other with nuclear missiles.",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/hiroshima-nagasaki-atomic-bomb-attack-timeline-a4518061.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,2bb2e1fbae3d31f97b11a677e6b078295dd555e0ab5805337292204d76770255,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

At 6.11pm, 25 minutes after the players had returned from a three-hour rain delay, the officials decided it was now too dark for spin bowling and, six minutes after that, stumps were called.

At the end of such a frustrating day, it was indeed bonkers for that to be the close, especially as by the time the post-match press conferences took place, artificial light had been surpassed by blazing early evening sunshine.  That Vaughan was talking on a highlights show on terrestrial TV was a reminder that just because there are no paying punters to serve this summer does not mean no one is watching. After a great summer of 2019, and with this being the only international sport on, it feels like cricket is as popular as it has been in a generation.  The Beeb's highlights is rating in the millions, while Sky Sports figures are approximately 30 per cent higher than usual. The West Indies series was the highest-viewed Test series since Sky has been broadcasting cricket (yes, that includes the Ashes). It was a brilliant series â and this one should be even better.  Test cricket, we are continually told, is dying. It is actually in rude health in England, but still has an issue with Britain's great uncontrollable: the weather. We get bad days here (more in Manchester than anywhere else). Delays for rain and light happen. Fine.  But with state-of-the-art drainage and epic floodlights installed at great expense, should these delays last as long as they do? Just as the day ended prematurely due to light, yesterday's rain delay certainly lasted longer than it needed to, as evidenced by England's players choosing to fill time, in the sun, by heading a football from their balcony into a bin on the patently dry outfield.  Put simply, Test cricket needs to be keener to be on the field, both when the weather is not absolutely perfect and the following day, when time should be made up first thing in the morning. This morning's play should have started at 10.30. That happens in other parts of the world, so why not in England?  Umpires are generally good people doing a hard job. At the highest level, they have many jobs to juggle, as evidenced by the no-ball's recent removal from their remit. Decisions around weather remain in the officials' gift and most decisions are simple: they think sensibly about safety and apply ICC protocol.  That protocol has long been filed under âridiculous cricketisms that should change but probably will notâ so perhaps the umpires are hamstrung.  But this summer, which has seen all four Tests blighted by the weather, has only enforced an unfortunate perception that umpires, who are almost all ex-players because they are so much better placed to read the game and make decisions, are out of touch.  So often do officials use umbrellas that it is a wonder the Umpbrolly has not been snapped up by a savvy sponsor. The only raised umbrella in the whole ground â because it is not raining â being an umpireâs, as often seems the case, is simply a bad look.  The application of common sense is rarer than the all-run four. Take timings: on the first day of the Second Test against West Indies, play started at 12.30pm, then they took a 40-minute lunch an hour later. There are plenty of mooted solutions to the gameâs weather issues, but a spot of logic and consideration of viewers would go further than the lot.  This summer, after such a long wait and so much effort and expense, such delays to the action are all the more frustrating. Fans deserve so much better.",https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/cricket/umpires-must-consider-the-poor-public-when-bad-light-halts-play-a4518076.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,e45f6f802198a1f73f6ccfbedd55a08781d1be139805834ae064441ca964cf6c,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

It seems that one of the OG Legends, Anita 'Bangalore' Williams, could be the focus for Season 6, following a series of audio files released by developers Respawn Entertainment.  Of course, these hints are extremely cryptic, but that's half the fun of all this.  So far, the official Apex twitter account has shared two audio files and a gif which is saying we should all prepare for an announcement at 6pm UK time tonight.  A video will go live at 6pm tonight which might be another animated short or it could be something else entirely related to a new Legend joining the roster.  Tonight's announcement aside, two audio log voice messages have been shared on Twitter, one is from Bangalore and the other is from a woman possibly known as Sheila and she appears to be talking to Bangalore.  The first recording goes: âHey, it's Williams. Man, P [unclear], ya already done? You ever sleep? Hiatus is coming up, so I'll swing by this weekend. Drinks are on me"".  The second audio log appears to be someone talking to a 'lovely lady Parekh' who could be the 'P' Bangalore refers to in the first audio file.  This time, it's a woman named Dion Bakar talking about how a custom weapon they were given is working well: ""That pistol you modded for me? A thing of beauty"".  For those of you who have played Apex, you know that Bangalore was one of the first Legends to launch with the game back in February 2019.  We know there's some story behind her enlistment in the IMC (an evil militaristic group in the TitanFall Universe, which Apex Legends takes place in) and that her brother either died or went missing after an attack.  The official Apex Legends website tells us that Bangalore's brother, Jackson, was sucked out into space during the attack and Bangalore ended up marooned on a Syndicate-owned planet.  From there, she's looking to raise money to buy her passage back to her home planet, which is why she entered the Apex Games.  Other than that and her expertise in military weapons and a penchant for a killer line, we don't know much about her character.  Other signs about the new season have been popping up around the map World's Edge.  These signs are hinting towards map changes or the outright destruction of the entire World's Edge map to introduce a brand new called Olympus  New hints are now available in-game, with one showing that some of the signs have been defaced with graffiti saying things like, ""All hail Sheila!"".  This could be a new character or Legend coming in Season 6, but at the moment there's nothing definitive, but we think Sheila could also be Sheila Parekh, mentioned in the audio files.  Apex Legends Season 5: Fortunes Favour is set to end on within the next two weeks, with the new season most likely set to arrive on Tuesday, August 18.",https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/gaming/apex-legends-season-6-hints-bangalore-a4517951.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,23227315754f1da6f115b832e06c598059fcae83e6b682495899677b134648e5,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Brentford are expected to demand at least Â£25million for their top scorer, with Villa boss Dean Smith keen on a reunion with the forward he brought to Griffin Park from Exeter in 2017.  Watkins, who was converted to a centre-forward by Thomas Frank ahead of last season, bagged 26 goals across both the regular season and play-off campaign but came up short in Tuesday's final against Fulham.  Brentford are now facing the prospect of having their top stars cherry-picked by Premier League clubs, with top-flight interest in winger Said Benrahma and full-back Rico Henry.  Palace have kept a keen eye on Watkins since last summer as they search to improve an attack which produced just 31 goals across 38 league games last season.  Only bottom-placed Norwich City, with 26, scored fewer goals than Roy Hodgson's side as Wilfried Zaha, Christian Benteke and Andros Townsend struggled with form and fitness.  Jordan Ayew proved a success but is more of a threat from wide, meaning Watkins - who wants a central role - would allow Palace's player of the year to take up his preferred role on the right.  ""I feel very comfortable there now,"" Watkins said recently of his role. ""I canât see myself playing anywhere else to be honest. I feel like Iâve taken to it, I feel very comfortable in this role.""  The Eagles are also chasing a deal for QPR's Eberechi Eze, having seen a tentative approach close to Â£12m knocked back by the Championship club. West Ham are also keen on the 22-year-old, with QPR hoping a bidding war will drive the price up closer to Â£20m.  A loan for Watford's Spanish winger Gerard Deulofeu following the Hornets' relegation is also an option for Palace, though not a priority as it stands.  Palace are attempting to drag down the average age of their squad, which was the oldest in the Premier League last season and have already brought in 19-year-old full-back Nathan Ferguson on free transfer from West Brom.",https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/crystal-palace-ollie-watkins-aston-villa-25m-a4518136.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,683b2ee016ba41e6030f75885b747a35cc7cce2a9b8ebfbf9dba6ae0febe4fca,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

With Season 5's launch, the Stadium area in CoD's battle royale mode Warzone has been opened up and you can now explore around it properly.  This area is the epicentre of a new puzzle which players are trying to figure out and it could be tied to a returning Call of Duty mode: Zombies.  In previous seasons, bunkers were added to Verdansk which required you to find phones which held a numeric code, read in Russian.  Chasing this thread would eventually lead you to open the secretive Bunker 11, but there are more all over Verdanskwhich remain closed and need a special red access card.  Introduced in Season 5, players have found new access cards called P2-16. These access cards are dotted around the new Stadium layout and they are used to unlock a secret small room in the area.  You can find this place in the parking garage and inside the room, you will find a computer. Upon interacting with the computer it will spew a series of numbers and characters at you.  Check out this video below, where one player has shown off how to get into the room and the mysterious computer.  As the video shows, you enter the room with the access card and you can then use the computer.  The computer in question, however, throws out a different sequence of numbers and characters each time, which makes it all the more confusing to figure out their importance.  Perhaps it is something that will be elucidated as the season continues, but at the moment one theory is that the symbols are also present in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare.  You might remember this game as it added a standalone campaign of sorts for Call of Duty: Zombies.  To this end, there is a secret Easter egg called the Shaolin Shuffle in the zombie mode which could be identical to this symbol we're seeing in Warzone.  This could, of course, be completely unrelated and tenuous as most rumours are.  But if it is to be believed, then we could be seeing some form of Call of Duty: Zombies coming either to the main Modern Warfare game or maybe even a special, limited-time event in Warzone.  At the moment, it is likely that the string of numbers and characters from the secret computer has something to do with other bunkers around the map.  Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone's Season 5 kicked off on August 5, so there's almost definitely going to be more uncovered as time goes on and more is added to the game.  if you're wondering about Season 5 and everything new to the game, we've covered the patch notes, the monumental download size and other news right here.",https://www.standard.co.uk/tech/gaming/call-of-duty-season-5-zombie-mode-hint-a4518121.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,94842584f6b9b027ea6daac9efcd12f33a8496f711cc31d29342fff84f62e778,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The Location, Location, Location host, 48, has triggered furious debate on Twitter, after she urged her followers to return to work.

""If I had an office job Iâd want to be first in the queue to get back to work and prove my worth to my employer. I am terrified by what could be on the horizon for so many.""  The TV personality then faced fury from followers, who called Allsopp out for making bold claims about home workers.  ""I've worked from home, full time for years due to chronic illness like so many others. Does that mean I've not proved my worth? No, it means I'm a skilled & trusted employee.

The property expert has since responded to the backlash, stating that her comments were not meant as an ""attack"" on those working from home, before posting a follow-up Tweet which reads: ""WFH works beautifully for some and is pretty hellish for others.

Figures showed 1,695 new cases within 24 hours âthe highest daily increase since May 30, when they were up by 1,828.

A number of senior players are thought to be preparing to demand an explanation for the proposed redundancies, announced yesterday by head of football Raul Sanllehi and managing director Vinai Venkatesham.  The majority of the squad agreed to a 12.5 percent pay-cut in April â reduced to 7.5 percent following Europa League qualification â on the understanding it would help save jobs, and some have been left dismayed by the news and fear they could be blamed.  Player power has already proved influential during the pandemic, with the Tottenham and Liverpool squads playing a part in their clubs' decisions to reverse using the taxpayer-funded furlough scheme.  Arsenal's decision to cut nearly 10 percent of employees was explained to staff by Sanllehi and Venkatesham in a conference call on Wednesday afternoon, with the players and Mikel Arteta informed separately. While some staff have already been told their fate, others remain in the dark despite the club having gone public.  Gunners legend Ian Wright was among those to express dismay as social media reacted with anger, tweeting at the club: ""Remember who you are, what you are and who you represent!!!"" accompanied by three upset emojis.  Arsenal's matchday revenue accounted for nearly 25 percent of their earnings in 2018-19 â the highest percentage in the Premier League â and the club said the measures were necessary due to the financial impact of the coronavirus.  While the majority of cuts are expected to be in commercial and administrative departments, some staff are being let go from football roles â including head of international scouting Francis Cagigao, head of UK scouting Peter Clark and scout Brian McDermott.  A source close to the club said those cuts were aimed at modernising the recruitment department as part of a move to a more data-driven model.  The Gunners have continued an old-fashioned approach of having scouts specialising in different regions but Arteta is thought to be pushing for a similar approach to that of Liverpool and Manchester City, who rely on analytics rather than roving scouts.

It comes amid signs that the relaxing of social distancing rules is raising the risk of a second wave of the disease.  According to data published by the Robert Koch Institute early on Thursday morning, the number of new infections rose by 1,045 to 213,067.  Figures have been steadily creeping up for weeks after hitting a low of 159 in July.  Read more Virus death toll jumps by 65 as local lockdowns enforced- LATEST  With Europe's largest economy only now starting to recover from the near-total lockdown that was imposed in March to stem the disease's spread, any sign of renewed restrictions on the horizon will dismay investors.  The head of the German doctors' union said earlier this week that Germany was already contending with a second wave of Covid-19 and risks squandering its early success by flouting social distancing rules.  Officials, including Health Minister Jens Spahn, have warned that it will become far harder to control the spread of new infections from autumn onwards.  This makes it all the more important to keep numbers down as the summer draws to a close.  The lockdown and social distancing pushed the number of new cases down to as low as 159 in mid-July.  But numbers have been rising since, fuelled by local outbreaks, including one centred on a slaughterhouse that required restrictions to be placed on the entire town of Guetersloh.

The countryâs civil aviation authority, Enac, said last night that it was considering suspending the Irish budget airlineâs permit for ârepeated violations of the Covid-19 health regulations currently in force and imposed by the Italian government to protect the health of passengersâ.  It is understood the airline has failed to enforce the wearing of masks by passengers and allowed them to rush off the planes without social distancing.  The regulator warned that if âviolations of the rulesâ continue it could prevent Ryanair from flying to or from Italy.  The airline serves 29 airports in Italy.  ENAC has raised its concerns with the Irish Aviation Authority.  Ryanair said in a statement that the claims made by ENAC are âfactually incorrectâ and insisted it is âcommitted to the highest level of safety for our passengers and crew at all timesâ.  It said its procedures are âin line with the safety recommendations and measures set out by the Italian governmentâ.  These include implementing boarding procedures to âavoid unnecessary gathering of passengersâ and making face masks mandatory for passengers and crew.

But if you need any more evidence to back this up, you only need to look to the understated windbreaker.  Windbreakers became popular in the 70s for outerwear with a performance-based purpose and a fashion twist, but truly found their staple status in the 80s and 90s when the style was co-opted by the hip hop scene.  Some of the most recognisable sportswear labels like Reebok and Adidas released a new crop of designs with bold colour blocking and logo adornments that transformed the once functional item into a streetwear essential - that has had a huge revival this season.  As athleisure shows no signs of slowing down, it may come as no surprise that this sporty style still belongs in your wardrobe. Whether as an accent piece or just a finishing touch to your outfit, you can go bright and statement or more neutral depending on your aesthetic.  Putting the fun in functionality, these jackets are also lightweight, breathable and more importantly, packable so you can pop them into your bag to layer up at a momentâs notice when the uncertain British weather takes a turn for the worse. Don the piece as you head on your outdoor adventures and tie around your waist when the temperature hots up.  See our pick of the best windbreakers for women that have both style and performance credentials.

It has the feel of a documentary, which is probably because half the cast are non-professionals and â just as crucially â arenât following a script. After Life may be about film-making but itâs not like other movies. Which is a great thing!  The concept behind it would appeal to Marie Kondo. In a sort-of office block in a rural wasteland, a bunch of dead people of all ages are encouraged to organise their memories. They must pick the most important or happy event from their past, so that this event can be re-created in a short film. Once theyâve watched the movie theyâll forget everything else and, free of mental clutter, spend the rest of eternity with those joyful sights and sounds.  As you might expect, the editing process proves easier for some than others. One of the old men, Mr Watanabe (Taketoshi Naito), overwhelmed by the so-so-ness of his existence, canât single anything out. And heâs not alone. We discover, mid-way through the film, that the counsellors in charge of the whole process were themselves either unable, or unwilling, to plump for a defining moment.  Hell is indecision and 22-year-old counsellor, Takashi (Arata), and his 18-year-old assistant, Shiori (Erika Oda), decide to help Mr Watanabe by showing him video tapes of all his years on earth, in hopes of prodding him into action. Which leads to a revelation for Takashi that changes his own attitude to the past.  Top 8 Japanese films to immerse yourself in 8 show all Top 8 Japanese films to immerse yourself in 1/8 1. Seven Samurai (Shichinin no samurai). Dir. Akira Kurosawa, 1954 Seven Samurai is a cinematic masterpiece, with some of the stylish cinematography which still holds up today. The film, which directly influenced the Ghost of Tsushima, vividly brings to life the ways of a samurai. It left a mark on the world of film still seen today, with movies like The Magnificent Seven being a direct retelling of the film in a gunslinging western setting. This paragon of samurai cinema regales us with a tale focusing on a group of Ronin (masterless samurai) hired by a village of farmers to fend off the regular attacks of a group of marauding bandits. Chaos and blisteringly perfect scenes ensue. Toho Company 2/8 2. 13 Assassins (Jusannin no shikaku) Dir. Eiichi Kudo, 1963 13 Assassins is set in 1844 and follows a similar set up to Seven Samurai, whereby a group is banding together to rid themselves of the populace of a corrupt lord. While the original has some pacing issues, it is saved by sublime cinematography and presentation. Not to mention that the second act of the film really picks up the pace, gifting us with devilishly intense scenes up until the film mercifully ends. Filmmaker Takashi Miike introduced a new generation of cinephiles to the samurai genre with his outstanding remake of the 1963 film. By all accounts, it's a shot-for-shot remake, to begin with, but departs from the source material to tell the story in greater depth, like introducing us to the assassins and their stories much sooner. The remake was met with critical acclaim, which was definitely helped by a larger budget than the original ever had access to; but there's a certain gravitas to the original which makes it stand out. Toei Company 3/8 3. Goemon, Dir. Kazuaki Kiriya, 2009 A story centred around the legendary thief from Japanese history, Goemon. Goemon Ishikawa was a Robin-Hood type legend who is regarded as one of the first gentleman thieves. Eventually, the story goes that Goemon and his son were boiled alive. Some of you might already be familiar with the legend of Goemon, which still comes a cropper in popular culture today, an example is the references to him in Persona 5. Thematically and visually, it focuses on the power struggles that lead to the end of the Warring States era of the 16th century and is one of a few films based on the mythic figure of Goemon Ishikawa. Daaichi Shokai Co 4/8 4. Yojimbo, Dir. Akira Kurosawa, 1961 Another dazzling, mind-bending entry for Kurosawa. Yojimbo follows the trials and tribulations of a wandering samurai. Sanjuro is a ronin, a masterless samurai, roaming around desolate towns and clearing out the local criminal gangs who have taken up residence there. Filled with sublime action and stunning visuals, this film was another direct inspiration for Ghost of Tsushima. Yojimbo, by the way, means 'Bodyguard' or generally refers to someone who you pay to protect you. Perhaps one of the most popular portrayals of 'Yojimbo' is from Final Fantasy X, who appears as an Aeon which Yuna can summon. His power is directly related to how much you pay him. Kurosawa Production Co 5/8 5. Princess Mononoke (Mononoke-hime) Dir. Hayao Miyazaki, 1997 Hayao Miyazakiâs gripping anime takes the late Muromachi Period (1336 to 1573) as its setting, adding a twist of fantasy to its richly drawn historical detail in an expansive tale of adventure set in a world caught in a conflict between nature and industrialisation. While not directly related to samurai, Princess Mononoke shines a glaring spotlight on nature and the preservation of the natural world. Maybe this isn't something that has directly inspired the world of Tsushima, but there's clearly an effort to show just how gorgeous nature is in the game. Kitsune will frolic and interact with you, birds will chirp overhead and the flora will literally be dancing on the screen. There's also a passing and missable reference to the sacred nature of deer, which samurai frown upon hunting. Juxtapose this with the devastation caused by the Mongol invasion to what happens in the film and there's some clear themes replicated. Studio Ghibli 6/8 6. The Samurai Trilogy, Dir. Hiroshi Inagaki 1954-6 These three films follow and chart the life of master swordsman Musashi Miyamoto. We see how Musashi tries to live along the Bushido way of the warrior through his numerous duels and battles. The story spans decades from his youth to his moment of spiritual awakening. The filmâs rousing fight scenes gave international viewers their introduction to the ethics and codes of the samurai, which lie at the heart of the storyline of Ghost of Tsushima. Ghost of Tsushima might have also taken a few notes from the combat in this film, considering how the action is relatively tame. There are no geysers of blood erupting out of wounds or limbs flying around in the game, just like how the action scenes in this film are portrayed. Toho Company 7/8 7. The Lone Wolf and Cub (Kozure Okami) Dir. Kenji Misumi and others, 1972â1974 Okami, or wolf, is a theme which pops up in a lot of samurai portrayal. A masterless samurai roams through the landscapes of feudal Japan, trundling his infant son along with a hidden arsenal of deadly weapons, as they seek revenge against the evil warlord who killed his wife. With striking shots that burn into your brain, this six-film adaptation of a famous manga series is both highly stylish and incredibly violent. Toho Company 8/8 8. Throne of Blood (Kumonosu-jo) Dir. Akira Kurosawa, 1957 Of all things, Throne of Blood is actually a retelling of Shakespeare's Macbeth. This film shows the lawless realm of 16th Century feudal Japan â a hauntingly atmospheric version of this universally relatable tale of grasping ambition and retribution. The Japanese setting lends a whole new vibe to the original and it is generally considered to be one of the best adaptations of Macbeth. Kurosawa Production Co 1/8 1.

Kurosawa Production Co  What Kore-eda pulls off is first class, if extremely low-budget, world-building. Itâs really funny. At one point, all the old-timers, preparing themselves for the big day, start blow-drying their hair, causing a power cut. Itâs gently provocative, too. Kore-eda questions religious dogma, along with the Disney-fication of childhood. Shiori points out, to a teenage girl, that adolescents routinely cite Disneyland theme parks as their happy place; the girl, with Shioriâs guidance, winds up choosing a more personal memory.  Even love gets cross-examined. Does it matter if your special memory involves someone whose own special memory doesnât involve you? Are strong feelings only valid if theyâre symmetrical?  These teasing questions create their own afterglow. Basically, if youâve have never seen this movie and are now planning to watch it, youâre on the brink of doing something youâll remember for the rest of your life.

Councils said they have major concerns about the shake-up, the biggest in 70 years, warning it would limit the power of local politicians to block developments.  Under the new rules, planning applications which meet pre-approved design codes in certain areas would get an automatic green light, eliminating an entire stage of local oversight.  Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it would âbe faster, but also build better quality homesâ.  Councillor Darren Rodwell, executive member for housing and planning at London Councils, which represents boroughs in the capital, said: âThese changes are potentially disastrous for Londoners and could reduce the amount of affordable housing built in the capital.â  Conservative councillor James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, said it was âvitalâ that new homes were built through a locally led planning system, otherwise there was a ârisk [of] giving developers the freedom to ride roughshod over local areasâ.  He added: âAny loss of local control over developments would be a concern. It would deprive communities of the ability to define the area they live in and know best and risk giving developers the freedom to ride roughshod over local areas.â  Tory councillor Mark Crane, of the District Councilsâ Network, said: âWe cannot compromise on the quality of new homes and places and side-line public consultation.â  Tom Copley, the deputy mayor of London for housing, told BBC Radio London: âThey are now proposing a top down reorganisation of the planning system which is going to actually take power away from local councils and local communities and hand them to the Secretary of State and hand them to developers.â  Georgia Gould, Labour leader of Camden council, tweeted: âThis Government is ... attacking councilâs ability to build council homes.â  However, Tory Councillor Matthew Green, Westminster City Councilâs cabinet member for business and planning, said if the new rules support high-quality housing for residents and key workers as well as affordable homes then they would welcome it.  Ministers argue the reform will âcut red tape but not standardsâ.  Mr Jenrick said it would protect green spaces while making it easier to build on previously developed brownfield land.  He told LBC: âAt the moment, very few people engage in the system. The evidence that weâve seen shows that less than 1% of people engage in the local plan-making process, those plans can take seven years to produce and are extremely complicated.  âLess than 4 per cent engage even when thereâs a planning application near their house that might have an impact on their home. So the current system isnât really working in terms of local engagement.â",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/councils-slam-robert-jenrick-planning-reforms-a4518091.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,7b5422a1a2e17d0bf2779292c5357d99045bbe99ab464549b3229084c58e3d00,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Melinda Coleman told TMZ that her daughter took her own life on Tuesday night.  Audrie & Daisy followed the young womanâs experiences of trauma and the impact on her family following the alleged attack she suffered as a teenager.  She was 14 when she reported being raped at a party in Maryville, Missouri.  No one was ever convicted of the assault, and the charge against the teenage boy she accused was dropped.  Ms Coleman spoke of being bullied in light of the incident, which sparked national attention.  She was reportedly found dead after her mother called police to check on her.  ""She was my best friend and amazing daughter,"" her mother wrote in a Facebook post.  ""I think she had to make it seem like I could live without her. I can't.  ""I wish I could have taken the pain from her! She never recovered from what those boys did to her and it's just not fair. My baby girl is gone.""  Daisy alleged she was assaulted by a 17-year-old Matthew Barnett at a house party in January 2012.  Melinda said she found her daughter outside the following morning wearing just a T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms in sub-zero temperatures.  Barnett was charged with a felony sexual assault but the case was eventually dropped. Ms Coleman's family argued that this was due the boy's family's local political connections.  Barnett pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of endangering the welfare of a child, arguing he had had consensual sex with Daisy.",https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/daisy-coleman-suicide-death-a4517841.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,9fe871af5e6781f1d64bcc167d754deb4759464c92b1489c7815eeb85981f0eb,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

2020-08-06 13:22:18.195775,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 08:30:09 GMT",Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho backs five-substitutes rule ahead of Premier League clubs' vote,"Jose Mourinho has no concerns over extending the use of five substitutes for next season, suggesting Tottenham are unlikely to be among the clubs to vote against the measure at Thursday's Premier League AGM.  The rule-change was initially introduced for Project Restart to reduce strain on players but leagues have been given the green light to extend it for the whole of next season, dividing the capital's top-flight clubs.  Chelsea and Arsenal are thought to be in favour but West Ham and Crystal Palace are both fiercely opposed, believing it will benefit bigger clubs with more squad depth. The pair could be joined in voting down the proposal by newly-promoted Fulham, with 14 of the 20 clubs needed to approve a rule change. It was voted through 16 to four last time.  Spurs have insisted they are indifferent, despite Mourinho claiming in June that a cabal of ""powerful clubs"" had forced through the measure. Now, though, the Spurs manager says he loves having nine players on the bench and is not against using five substitutes going forward.  ""I like having 20 players [in the squad],"" Mourinho told Standard Sport. ""It doesn't make any sense to travel with 20 players and then have to send two guys to the stands when the clubs pay every player and invest in every player.  ""And it's much better to have on the bench a right-back, a left-back, a centre-back, a winger, a midfielder, a striker â to have everything there because it's the ammunition you need.  ""For all tactical reasons, beauty of the game, competitive of the game, it's a fair way to treat players because they want to feel they're in the game, and they feel that on the bench. It's different to staying at home.  ""So the 20 players on the bench, I love it. It gives you more chance to bring young people [on] and gives a much better feeling to everybody.  ""The five subs, I don't mind,"" he added. ""In the majority of matches, myself, I felt no need for that. But one thing is no need, another thing is no chance.  ""So if you have the chance to do it, I don't think it's a problem. Because it can only be done in three periods, it doesn't affect much more the real time of the game, coaches cannot stop the game five times as you know. I think it's fine. I don't see a problem at all with that.""  In the first Premier League meeting of the new season, clubs are also expected to begin talks on how they would curtail a future campaign if faced with another shutdown or similar.  Play was suspended in March with 92 top-flight fixtures remaining but nothing in the rulebook to determine how to decide the final positions if the season could not continue. European leagues opted for a number of different measures to curtail the season and clubs will on Thursday hold initial discussions before a full consultation.  Clubs will also be updated on the return of fans to stadiums, with the Premier League having told the Government they are happy to use pre-season friendlies as test events, while the implementation of VAR and the issue of post-Brexit access to talent are also expected be raised.",https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/tottenham-jose-mourinho-five-substitutes-premier-league-agm-vote-a4517956.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,87dc16ccee7fb08437c22d99d682519a2663ff3e41f7256f2cbb21101acb97d9,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:18.704181,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 08:30:06 GMT",London Marathon 2020 set to be cancelled due to coronavirus pandemic,"The rescheduled Virgin Money London Marathon will be shelved until next year because of the sheer impossibility of organising a huge mass participation event during the coronavirus pandemic, according to reports.  Organisers are expected to bow to the inevitable this evening and confirm that the 40th running of one of the highlights of Londonâs sporting calendar cannot take place on October 4 as planned.  It has already been postponed once from the original date of April 26 and will now not take place until next Spring.  Sources reported by The Times newspaper suggested organisers are still hoping to arrange a showdown âduelâ between two of greatest ever marathon runners, Eliud Kipchoge and Kenenisa Bekele, through the Royal Parks of central London on the day the event was scheduled for.  Kenyan Kipchoge, 35, the current world record holder, and Ethiopian Bekele, 38, have set the two fastest times in marathon history and sources have said that they are still keen to compete in a year that has seen the usual elite marathon schedule wiped out.

runners can come to London providing they follow strict Covid protocols.  However, the decision is a huge setback for the 40,000 amateur runners who have been training since the start of a year for an event that has now been twice postponed.  It is also a major blow for charities that rely on income from sponsorship of athletes. Since 1981 more than Â£1 billion has been raised for good causes.  Last month the organisers of the Great North Run had to delay the 40th edition of their race - due to take place on September 13 - with 60,000 runners, until next year.",https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/london-marathon-2020-set-to-be-cancelled-due-to-coronavirus-pandemic-a4518056.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,24cea2bdc90de6df7fcc4a062dbe95647e2b1df7c6cddb9e6086f77c92bc8c7b,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The next stage to revelling in Londonâs reopening social scene? Choosing your physical bubble, too.  Private party pods are the smartest way to pandemic-proof (and rain-proof) your August and happily, the capital has a glittering new collection of exclusive drinking dens: Coppa Clubâs notorious riverside igloos have had a summer makeover as miniature English gardens, while The Standard in Kingâs Cross is offering private party suites for bubbles of six.  From tropical dining cabanas to Thames-side beach huts decked out with real sand, this is your pod guide.  The party bubble  Hotspot: The Standard, WC1H, standardhotels.com  USP: Your own private bartender and outdoor bathtubs  Bubble size: Six  Cost: From Â£500  No nightclub, no problem. For socially-acceptable revelry, head to the eighth floor suites of Kingâs Crossâ buzzy Standard hotel, which is now open and offering decadent âparty bubblesâ with indoor dining tables and an alfresco bathtubs and lounge seating from Friday. The hotel has long established itself as one of the capitalâs coolest hangouts and the bespoke packages are designed to keep Londoners partying. Each is tailored to guestsâ pod goals, whether itâs mountains of chocolate Martinis and mustard-smothered micro-hot dogs from the hotelâs downstairs dive-bar, Double Standard, or a private bartender to keep glasses topped up and make cocktails on request. More bubbles, please.  The DJ booth  Hotspot: Brixton Courtyard, SW9, thebrixtoncourtyard.co.uk  USP: Artists from Norman Jay to Friendly Fires are among the line-up for the rest of summer  Bubble size: Up to 12  Cost: From Â£200  Remember live music? Brixton Jamm wants to bring some of that back with its revamped outdoor music venue, The Brixton Courtyard, kitted out with Covid-proof flamingo-themed booths for enjoying the DJ line-up and a street food catalogue to match - just download the app to order pints and steak flatbreads your table. Among the guest nights booked in for the the next month: a funk and soul barbecue with Craig Charles; a Thursday night groove session with Bondax and Karma Kid; and live sets from Friendly Fires, Little Gay Brother and Norman Jay. Coming up, the courtyard is also planning boozy brunches, pub quizzes, comedy shows and drag bingo in line with government guidelines.  The private-dining cabana  Hotspot: The Mandrake, W1T, themandrake.com  USP: Private bathrooms and live wellness workshops while you eat  Bubble size: Five  Cost: Minimum spend Â£300  The Mandrakeâs exotic new private-dining cabanas on the hotelâs terrace arenât just an eating and drinking spot - theyâre your all-day hideaway. Each is decked out with tropical greenery, rattan-style furniture and cosy cushions, plus its very own bathroom for privacy and touch-ups in the mirrors. Think of it as a wellness retreat above the city. Dishes include courgette flowers, smoked cheese quesadillas and grilled lamb-shoulder and fried fish tacos; Jalapeno cocktails top the drinks menu; and thereâs an entertainment element, too. Each of the ten paradise pods is fitted with a screen for streaming your own music or the hotelâs wellness workshops. Weekly sessions include sound healing, meditation and dreaming and drumming.  The summer igloo  Hotspot: Coppa Club, EC3R, coppaclub.co.uk  USP: Instagram bragging rights - this monthâs igloo slots sold out in seconds  Bubble size: Eight, but government guidance is for no more than six  Cost: Minimum spend Â£240, regardless of party size  Itâs almost like Coppa Club saw pod life coming. This year, the riverside barâs famous winter domes have had a summer makeover: think ice-cold Aperols and Coppa Coladas instead of hot toddies, and heaters and rugs replaced with sliding doors for sunbathing.  All eight igloos have views of Tower Bridge and have been transformed into miniature English gardens for the rest of summer, with solar lanterns hanging in jam jars and splashes of light pinks, purples and blues. Each pod has its own speaker so you can set the vibe. If you missed this monthâs two-hour slots, the club releases its next round of reservations on August 31, but act fast: last time, demand crashed the site crashed on day one.

The al fresco restaurants to enjoy in London after lockdown 30 show all The al fresco restaurants to enjoy in London after lockdown 1/30 The Garden at The Berkeley Not only has the Knightsbridge hotel boosted its post-lockdown al fresco seating, it has dedicated an entire new restaurant to it. The Garden at The Berkeley is a brand new addition to the west London destination, a Mediterranean-style terrace tucked away between The Berkeley Bar and neighbouring St Paulâs church. Sat at socially distanced tables, diners can enjoy the likes charred octopus with saffron aioli and steaks with smoked shallot butter, all cooked outdoors on barbecues. Justin De Souza 2/30 Le Pont de la Tour Le Pont de la Tour offers one of the most iconic vistas in London. On its terrace, delicate French cuisine and a bountiful selection of seafood can be enjoyed looking out onto Tower Bridge â it really is a dazzling view of the world famous landmark, particularly with a bit of sun on your side. 3/30 Dalloway Terrace The decor of this Bloomsbury spot may change with the seasons, but it is perennially pleasant. Dalloway Terrace is best known for its spectacular floral installations â changing from icy white and pink in the winter, to a rose-draped English garden in the summer â making for a highly Instagrammable brunch spot. A retractable canopy means the terrace can be used all year round â blankets are handed out in colder months, panama hats in warmer ones. Diners can now also book the âprivate gardenâ for a little seclusion. 4/30 Folie This upmarket French spot on the border of Soho and Mayfair is embracing the al fresco culture of the nationâs Riviera this summer. When it reopens after lockdown, it will introduce outdoor seating for the first time â vibrant blue seats lined up in a Parisian fashion along the street outside â where guests can enjoy a menu designed especially for summer, featuring Courgettes farÃ§ies and heirloom tomatoes with burrata. 5/30 The Ivy Chelsea Garden The Ivy in Covent Garden may be the original and best, but this west London offshoot is a unique gem amid the Ivy Collectionâs growing portfolio. Inside, the Kingâs Road spot is festooned with blooms both real and doodled onto the walls, before the restaurant opens up onto an almost absurdly leafy garden â and not all of it is ivy (sorry). The garden has recently been refurbished, so expect it to look better than ever. Paul Winch-Furness 6/30 Parrillan Tapas restaurant Barrafina gives a superlative taste of Spain, but its Coal Drops Yard spin-off Parrillan is your best bet for enjoying Iberian food in the sun. The outdoor restaurant is named for its small Spanish tabletop charcoal barbecues, on which diners can grill their own meat, seafood and vegetables, served alongside a selection of classic Barrafina dishes. You can book for a table underneath the canopy, while walk-ins are available for the uncovered spots. Greg Funnell 7/30 Sam's Riverside This Hammersmith restaurant has been blessed with riverside views since it opened at the end of last year. After lockdown, it will be making the most of them by opening up a brand new âseafood terraceâ, allowing diners to sit outdoors for the first time. The 32-seat space will serve a fish-focused menu, featuring grilled native lobster, a shrimp cocktail salad and an oyster-filled âShuckers Platterâ. 8/30 Plaza Pastor The team behind Barrafina have really got into the al fresco mood in the last year or so. Just below Parrillan, youâll find Plaza Pastor, the outdoor follow-up to Borough Marketâs El Pastor (another one of their success stories). Neighbouring another sibling spot Casa Pastor, the terrace-only restaurant is entirely outdoors, but covered by a roof. Here you can tuck into the Mexican spots namesake tacos, ceviches and sharing plates of roast meat, as well as enjoy margaritas from the outdoor bar. Sam Ashton 9/30 Paradise Paradise first opened its doors last year, serving a taste of Sri Lankan cooking to Soho. This summer, it will reopen and bring its chef Charith Priyadarshanaâs dishes out into the street for the first. The restaurant will introduce al fresco dining outside its premises on Rupert Street for the first time, with guests able to snack on mutton shoulder rolls and green mango curry in the sun (hopefully). 10/30 Paladar This Elephant and Castle hideaway has said it will be going âal fresco firstâ when it reopens, meaning they will only take reservations for outdoor diners, leaving the dining room vacant to bring its diners inside in case the weather turns. Those who head to the restaurantâs tucked away courtyard will be greeted with Latin American-influenced, gluten-free dishes and a selection of cocktails. 11/30 Padella Given up on getting into Padella? Time to rethink. The acclaimed London Bridge pasta restaurant welcomed a sibling spot in Shoreditch last year to ease its famous queues and, while it still wonât be taking reservations, it will be welcoming more diners than ever before. Both restaurants are set to open with additional al fresco tables after lockdown, including an extra 40 seats added to the Borough Market spot. 12/30 Hicce Coal Drops Yard restaurant Hicce has been thinking outside the box (and its walls) for a number of weeks already. Throughout lockdown, chef Pip Lacey has been running a market beneath her first-floor Kingâs Cross restaurant, selling products from Hicceâs kitchen â including beer bread and honey soy mooli pickles â as well as from favourite suppliers. The restaurant will now serve sandwiches and antipasti at the market too, as well as its full menu on its alfresco terrace upstairs. 13/30 Gunpowder Tower Bridge The second iteration of Gunpowder is not just home to critically acclaimed Indian fare, but also a pretty picturesque view. Sit facing the river on its outdoor terrace and the pedestrianised street perfectly frames the world-famous profile of Tower Bridge. After lockdown, the restaurant will be extending its terrace to accommodate another 20 diners. Ola Smit 14/30 Darby's Nine Elms may not be high up on your list of summer destinations in the city, but Darbyâs â the restaurant from Robin Gill of The Dairy fame â should be. The restaurantâs glass front opens entirely, looking out onto a large, sun-trapping courtyard with a trickling pool at its centre. The restaurant is also expected to service Londonâs first âsky poolâ â a glass bottomed pool suspended 115ft above ground â when it opens after a (fairly long) delay. Nic Crilly-Hargrave 15/30 Brat x Climpson's Arch The Michelin-starred home of Tomos Parryâs fire-led cooking â and THAT turbot dish â is going on a little summer holiday. The Shoreditch restaurant is heading further east for an al fresco residency at Climpsonâs Arch in London Fields, where it will serve Basque-inspired dishes cooked in outdoor wood ovens. The original restaurant is set to reopen with indoor seating later in July. 16/30 Allegra Patrick Powellâs critically lauded restaurant on the seventh floor of The Stratford hotel is about to get even more special. For the first time since the restaurant opened last year, diners will be able to enjoy the three terraces that surround the restaurant and the views of the Olympic Park that come with it. This includes the Sky Garden, the largest of the spaces, which has been planted with wildflowers to echo the flora of nearby Hackney Marshes. 17/30 Petersham Nurseries The acclaimed cafe-style spot serves up its seasonally focused food inside a glasshouse but when the sunny weather is guaranteed to hold out, it also serves tables under its wisteria and rose-covered outdoor pergola. Itâs an open air affair at the multi-restaurant Covent Garden location too, where the Floral Court is home to outdoor seating for Italian kitchen La Goccia. 18/30 Tavolino Louis Korovilasâs new London Bridge restaurant was meant to open in April â for obvious reasons, it didnât. Post-lockdown, the ex-Bancone and Locanda Locatelli chef will finally kickstart life at his new Italian spot, where a new 70-seat outdoor terrace will embrace both diners and views of the City and the Tower of London. 19/30 Dishoom Shoreditch Dishoom boasts aesthetically pleasing places across the capital, but sun-seekers should head to its Shoreditch branch. At the East End location, diners can take their bacon naan and black daal on the âverandahâ: an area open to the heavens (with a retractable roof just in case) which is decorated with eclectic wooden furnishings and a quirky selection of books and vintage prints. 20/30 Chicama Inside, Chelsea restaurant Chicama is a pastel paradise, its soft pink and blue decor given a kick with zingy Peruvian dishes spilling out of the open kitchen. Outside, the neighbourhood feel of the restaurant extends onto the small terrace. Tucked just off the Kingâs Road, guests cuddle up under similarly pastel blankets on vintage furniture, surrounded by cascading plants. 21/30 Sea Containers The outdoor area at this Bankside restaurant is not so much all at sea, but rather riverside. At Sea Containers, a dining spot at the hotel of the same name, the Tom Dixon-designed interior was flanked last summer by a brightly coloured Laurent Perrier terrace, serving up a seafood-focused menu. Theyâre soon to announce the details of what it will look like this year, but the views of St Paulâs and the City across the Thames are always spot on. 22/30 The Prince Thereâs a party going on in West Brompton. Formerly the Prince of Wales pub, the Prince boasts a host of partially covered pergolas draped with the flowers and foliage of an English summer garden. Food comes courtesy of burger favourite Patty & Bun, pasta purveyor Nonna Tonda, and homegrown comfort food spot Wildcard. 23/30 Orrery Dining inside Marylebone French restaurant is a delight, but the rooftop on a sunny day is where youâll really find a slice of Provence. The semi-covered terrace is surrounded by potted lavender plants and tumbling ivy â an intimate hideaway for al fresco bites of Jerusalem artichoke risotto and poached salmon with oscietra caviar. 24/30 Boundary Rooftop The Shoreditch skyline isnât known for being the most spectacular, but rising above the hustle and bustle of below to kick back on Boundary Londonâs rooftop is still a rewarding experience. Mediterranean dining can be enjoyed whatever the weather in the restaurantâs glass-encased Orangery, or outside on the heated terrace, which is peppered with both proper tables and cosy armchair set ups. 25/30 Scott's The terrace at Scottâs has to be one of the most glamourous and best-known street-side dining spots in the city. The Mayfair restaurant is no stranger to famous faces lured by its sumptuous seafood offerings, and while you can book a spot outdoors, a private dining room inside boasts one of the worldâs most expensive restaurant interiors. 26/30 Kricket White City White City has changed more than a bit in the last couple of years, and the rejigging of the old BBC Television Centre is at the centre of the shake up. The development is now home to a host of restaurants, including Brixton-born Indian sensation Kricket, whose latest venture looks out across the square to the iconic cylindrical building, with outdoor seating for maximum viewing. Keralan fried chicken in the sun? Donât mind if we do. 27/30 Rochelle Canteen Margot Hendersonâs long-standing Shoreditch favourite gets even better on a sunny day: the outdoor seating surrounding the converted bike sheds of a Victorian school is an enviable spot, the sunshine dappled for some tables by overhead grapevines. Youâll need to press a buzzer to be allowed inside the grounds â ideal for a little seclusion. 28/30 Pop Brixton If snacking on street food is your idea of a summer well spent, Pop Brixton is a sure-fire hit. The south London shipping container complex is made up of stalls from local independent businesses, with a host of food concepts including Halo Burger, Koi Ramen, Mamaâs Jerk and Other Side Fried. The venue will reopen with table service on July 4, and youâll need to bring a facemask with you to get in (youâll need to wear it when youâre not sat at your table). Camille Mack 29/30 Sushisamba Covent Garden Sushisamba has already dropped around 30 floors on its travels from the City to the West End, and has also expanded from its perch on top of Covent Garden Market to the square itself. Diners can enjoy Sushisambaâs Japanese-Peruvian-Brazilian food in the famous promenade, all under weather-proof orange canopies. 30/30 Vinegar Yard While itâs tempting to say Vinegar Yard is in the shadow of the Shard, that couldnât be further from the truth. This new street food and vintage flea market near the base of Londonâs tallest building is bathed in sunlight in the afternoons. You can still enjoy food and drink from the likes of Baba Gâs, Nanny Billâs and Up In My Grill, and youâll now be able to book spots on the communal tables for up to six people, with drinks packages available. Whether youâve booked or not, you will need to sign up to their Track & Trace system online before youâll be allowed entry. 1/30 The Garden at The Berkeley Not only has the Knightsbridge hotel boosted its post-lockdown al fresco seating, it has dedicated an entire new restaurant to it. The Garden at The Berkeley is a brand new addition to the west London destination, a Mediterranean-style terrace tucked away between The Berkeley Bar and neighbouring St Paulâs church. Sat at socially distanced tables, diners can enjoy the likes charred octopus with saffron aioli and steaks with smoked shallot butter, all cooked outdoors on barbecues. Justin De Souza 2/30 Le Pont de la Tour Le Pont de la Tour offers one of the most iconic vistas in London. On its terrace, delicate French cuisine and a bountiful selection of seafood can be enjoyed looking out onto Tower Bridge â it really is a dazzling view of the world famous landmark, particularly with a bit of sun on your side. 3/30 Dalloway Terrace The decor of this Bloomsbury spot may change with the seasons, but it is perennially pleasant. Dalloway Terrace is best known for its spectacular floral installations â changing from icy white and pink in the winter, to a rose-draped English garden in the summer â making for a highly Instagrammable brunch spot. A retractable canopy means the terrace can be used all year round â blankets are handed out in colder months, panama hats in warmer ones. Diners can now also book the âprivate gardenâ for a little seclusion. 4/30 Folie This upmarket French spot on the border of Soho and Mayfair is embracing the al fresco culture of the nationâs Riviera this summer. When it reopens after lockdown, it will introduce outdoor seating for the first time â vibrant blue seats lined up in a Parisian fashion along the street outside â where guests can enjoy a menu designed especially for summer, featuring Courgettes farÃ§ies and heirloom tomatoes with burrata. 5/30 The Ivy Chelsea Garden The Ivy in Covent Garden may be the original and best, but this west London offshoot is a unique gem amid the Ivy Collectionâs growing portfolio. Inside, the Kingâs Road spot is festooned with blooms both real and doodled onto the walls, before the restaurant opens up onto an almost absurdly leafy garden â and not all of it is ivy (sorry). The garden has recently been refurbished, so expect it to look better than ever. Paul Winch-Furness 6/30 Parrillan Tapas restaurant Barrafina gives a superlative taste of Spain, but its Coal Drops Yard spin-off Parrillan is your best bet for enjoying Iberian food in the sun. The outdoor restaurant is named for its small Spanish tabletop charcoal barbecues, on which diners can grill their own meat, seafood and vegetables, served alongside a selection of classic Barrafina dishes. You can book for a table underneath the canopy, while walk-ins are available for the uncovered spots. Greg Funnell 7/30 Sam's Riverside This Hammersmith restaurant has been blessed with riverside views since it opened at the end of last year. After lockdown, it will be making the most of them by opening up a brand new âseafood terraceâ, allowing diners to sit outdoors for the first time. The 32-seat space will serve a fish-focused menu, featuring grilled native lobster, a shrimp cocktail salad and an oyster-filled âShuckers Platterâ. 8/30 Plaza Pastor The team behind Barrafina have really got into the al fresco mood in the last year or so. Just below Parrillan, youâll find Plaza Pastor, the outdoor follow-up to Borough Marketâs El Pastor (another one of their success stories). Neighbouring another sibling spot Casa Pastor, the terrace-only restaurant is entirely outdoors, but covered by a roof. Here you can tuck into the Mexican spots namesake tacos, ceviches and sharing plates of roast meat, as well as enjoy margaritas from the outdoor bar. Sam Ashton 9/30 Paradise Paradise first opened its doors last year, serving a taste of Sri Lankan cooking to Soho. This summer, it will reopen and bring its chef Charith Priyadarshanaâs dishes out into the street for the first. The restaurant will introduce al fresco dining outside its premises on Rupert Street for the first time, with guests able to snack on mutton shoulder rolls and green mango curry in the sun (hopefully). 10/30 Paladar This Elephant and Castle hideaway has said it will be going âal fresco firstâ when it reopens, meaning they will only take reservations for outdoor diners, leaving the dining room vacant to bring its diners inside in case the weather turns. Those who head to the restaurantâs tucked away courtyard will be greeted with Latin American-influenced, gluten-free dishes and a selection of cocktails. 11/30 Padella Given up on getting into Padella? Time to rethink. The acclaimed London Bridge pasta restaurant welcomed a sibling spot in Shoreditch last year to ease its famous queues and, while it still wonât be taking reservations, it will be welcoming more diners than ever before. Both restaurants are set to open with additional al fresco tables after lockdown, including an extra 40 seats added to the Borough Market spot. 12/30 Hicce Coal Drops Yard restaurant Hicce has been thinking outside the box (and its walls) for a number of weeks already. Throughout lockdown, chef Pip Lacey has been running a market beneath her first-floor Kingâs Cross restaurant, selling products from Hicceâs kitchen â including beer bread and honey soy mooli pickles â as well as from favourite suppliers. The restaurant will now serve sandwiches and antipasti at the market too, as well as its full menu on its alfresco terrace upstairs. 13/30 Gunpowder Tower Bridge The second iteration of Gunpowder is not just home to critically acclaimed Indian fare, but also a pretty picturesque view. Sit facing the river on its outdoor terrace and the pedestrianised street perfectly frames the world-famous profile of Tower Bridge. After lockdown, the restaurant will be extending its terrace to accommodate another 20 diners. Ola Smit 14/30 Darby's Nine Elms may not be high up on your list of summer destinations in the city, but Darbyâs â the restaurant from Robin Gill of The Dairy fame â should be. The restaurantâs glass front opens entirely, looking out onto a large, sun-trapping courtyard with a trickling pool at its centre. The restaurant is also expected to service Londonâs first âsky poolâ â a glass bottomed pool suspended 115ft above ground â when it opens after a (fairly long) delay. Nic Crilly-Hargrave 15/30 Brat x Climpson's Arch The Michelin-starred home of Tomos Parryâs fire-led cooking â and THAT turbot dish â is going on a little summer holiday. The Shoreditch restaurant is heading further east for an al fresco residency at Climpsonâs Arch in London Fields, where it will serve Basque-inspired dishes cooked in outdoor wood ovens. The original restaurant is set to reopen with indoor seating later in July. 16/30 Allegra Patrick Powellâs critically lauded restaurant on the seventh floor of The Stratford hotel is about to get even more special. For the first time since the restaurant opened last year, diners will be able to enjoy the three terraces that surround the restaurant and the views of the Olympic Park that come with it. This includes the Sky Garden, the largest of the spaces, which has been planted with wildflowers to echo the flora of nearby Hackney Marshes. 17/30 Petersham Nurseries The acclaimed cafe-style spot serves up its seasonally focused food inside a glasshouse but when the sunny weather is guaranteed to hold out, it also serves tables under its wisteria and rose-covered outdoor pergola. Itâs an open air affair at the multi-restaurant Covent Garden location too, where the Floral Court is home to outdoor seating for Italian kitchen La Goccia. 18/30 Tavolino Louis Korovilasâs new London Bridge restaurant was meant to open in April â for obvious reasons, it didnât. Post-lockdown, the ex-Bancone and Locanda Locatelli chef will finally kickstart life at his new Italian spot, where a new 70-seat outdoor terrace will embrace both diners and views of the City and the Tower of London. 19/30 Dishoom Shoreditch Dishoom boasts aesthetically pleasing places across the capital, but sun-seekers should head to its Shoreditch branch. At the East End location, diners can take their bacon naan and black daal on the âverandahâ: an area open to the heavens (with a retractable roof just in case) which is decorated with eclectic wooden furnishings and a quirky selection of books and vintage prints. 20/30 Chicama Inside, Chelsea restaurant Chicama is a pastel paradise, its soft pink and blue decor given a kick with zingy Peruvian dishes spilling out of the open kitchen. Outside, the neighbourhood feel of the restaurant extends onto the small terrace. Tucked just off the Kingâs Road, guests cuddle up under similarly pastel blankets on vintage furniture, surrounded by cascading plants. 21/30 Sea Containers The outdoor area at this Bankside restaurant is not so much all at sea, but rather riverside. At Sea Containers, a dining spot at the hotel of the same name, the Tom Dixon-designed interior was flanked last summer by a brightly coloured Laurent Perrier terrace, serving up a seafood-focused menu. Theyâre soon to announce the details of what it will look like this year, but the views of St Paulâs and the City across the Thames are always spot on. 22/30 The Prince Thereâs a party going on in West Brompton. Formerly the Prince of Wales pub, the Prince boasts a host of partially covered pergolas draped with the flowers and foliage of an English summer garden. Food comes courtesy of burger favourite Patty & Bun, pasta purveyor Nonna Tonda, and homegrown comfort food spot Wildcard. 23/30 Orrery Dining inside Marylebone French restaurant is a delight, but the rooftop on a sunny day is where youâll really find a slice of Provence. The semi-covered terrace is surrounded by potted lavender plants and tumbling ivy â an intimate hideaway for al fresco bites of Jerusalem artichoke risotto and poached salmon with oscietra caviar. 24/30 Boundary Rooftop The Shoreditch skyline isnât known for being the most spectacular, but rising above the hustle and bustle of below to kick back on Boundary Londonâs rooftop is still a rewarding experience. Mediterranean dining can be enjoyed whatever the weather in the restaurantâs glass-encased Orangery, or outside on the heated terrace, which is peppered with both proper tables and cosy armchair set ups. 25/30 Scott's The terrace at Scottâs has to be one of the most glamourous and best-known street-side dining spots in the city. The Mayfair restaurant is no stranger to famous faces lured by its sumptuous seafood offerings, and while you can book a spot outdoors, a private dining room inside boasts one of the worldâs most expensive restaurant interiors. 26/30 Kricket White City White City has changed more than a bit in the last couple of years, and the rejigging of the old BBC Television Centre is at the centre of the shake up. The development is now home to a host of restaurants, including Brixton-born Indian sensation Kricket, whose latest venture looks out across the square to the iconic cylindrical building, with outdoor seating for maximum viewing. Keralan fried chicken in the sun? Donât mind if we do. 27/30 Rochelle Canteen Margot Hendersonâs long-standing Shoreditch favourite gets even better on a sunny day: the outdoor seating surrounding the converted bike sheds of a Victorian school is an enviable spot, the sunshine dappled for some tables by overhead grapevines. Youâll need to press a buzzer to be allowed inside the grounds â ideal for a little seclusion. 28/30 Pop Brixton If snacking on street food is your idea of a summer well spent, Pop Brixton is a sure-fire hit. The south London shipping container complex is made up of stalls from local independent businesses, with a host of food concepts including Halo Burger, Koi Ramen, Mamaâs Jerk and Other Side Fried. The venue will reopen with table service on July 4, and youâll need to bring a facemask with you to get in (youâll need to wear it when youâre not sat at your table). Camille Mack 29/30 Sushisamba Covent Garden Sushisamba has already dropped around 30 floors on its travels from the City to the West End, and has also expanded from its perch on top of Covent Garden Market to the square itself.

The Oxford University-led study, known as Copcov, is aiming to enrol 40,000 healthcare workers from across the world to determine whether the drug is effective at fighting Covid-19.  Hydroxychloroquine has been regularly discredited as an acceptable treatment for the virus, with multiple scientific studies suggesting the anti-malaria drug can actually do more harm than good.  Donald Trump, who has touted the medicineâs potential benefits throughout the pandemic, told a news briefing on Monday that it has become âpolitically toxicâ only because âI supported itâ.  He told reporters: âIf I had said 'do not use hydroxychloroquine under any circumstances,' they (health officials) would have come out and said it's a great thing.â  The US president took a two-week course of the medication in May, even as the countryâs top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, dismissed the drug.  Meanwhile, the researchers behind Copcov have stressed that, while the drug has been ruled out as a method to treat infections, it may still be able to prevent them.  One of the trialâs lead investigators Dr Will Schilling said: âWe really donât know if hydroxychloroquine works or not in prevention or very early treatment. That question remains unanswered.  âThe benefits found in small post-exposure treatment trials, although modest, could be very valuable if they were confirmed.â  Professor Nick Day, director of the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit which is also guiding the study, said the Copcov trial will be able to find a definitive answer to the drugâs effectiveness.  He said: âBy the time patients are admitted to hospital virus multiplication is well past its peak and inflammation in the lungs and other complications may prove lethal.  âAt this stage the steroid dexamethasone, which reduces inflammation, saves lives but the antivirals hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine do not.  âHowever, that does not rule out that they could be effective much earlier in the illness. Prevention is much easier than cure.

Please log in Register with your social account or click here to log in I would like to receive lunchtime headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts, by email Update newsletter preferences  Pygmy hogs - the world's smallest and rarest wild pig - have been put are under a virus lockdown.  However, the restrictions are not related to coronavirus but to the first outbreak of African swine flu in India. The disease has already killed over 16,000 domestic pigs.  Pradip Gogoi, an official at Assam state's animal husbandry wing, said there is no vaccine or cure for the highly contagious virus.  The shy, 10-inch tall pygmy hogs suffered severe habitat loss and were thought to be extinct in the 1960s.  Then, in recent decades, a captive breeding program and other conservation efforts have brought the species back.  Now there are nearly 300 animals living in pockets of the north-eastern state of Assam but scientists fear the virus could decimate the still-endangered population.  Authorities confirmed the swine fever outbreak reached India in May.  Scientists then virtually locked down the breeding centres and adopted strict precautions, said Mr Deka, who heads the Pygmy Hog Conservation Program run jointly by Indian authorities, UK-based Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and local nonprofit Aaranyak.  ""It is very scary,"" Mr Deka said. ""It can wipe out the whole population.""  The virus spreads mainly by direct contact between pigs, through infected meat or contaminated material â and a vaccine is realistically two or three years away, said Linda Dixon, who has been researching the virus at The Pirbright Institute in the UK.  The virus kills almost all infected pigs, Ms Dixon said. ""It can decimate populations of wild pig or domestic pig. It could be very bad.""  At the breeding centres at Nameri and the state capital Guwahati, where there are 82 pigs and piglets, scientists have erected two parallel security fences. No visitors are allowed and cars can't park at the facilities  Some staff members who live off-site need to leave their shoes at the entrance. Then they must shower, wash their hands and feet, dip their feet in anti-viral solution and don fresh shoes to go inside.  ""This is the new normal,"" Mr Deka said.  The virus threat also means a change of diet for the pigs. While fruit and grains are still on the menu, vegetables that grow underground such as tapioca and sweet potatoes have been off limits because the virus survives longer in soil.  Pygmy hogs are among the few mammals â and the only pig â that build elaborate nests out of dried grass to live in families of four and five year-round.  After the swine fever outbreak, conservationists scoured markets until they found one vendor who had collected his thatch â dried grass used to cover roofs â before December 2019.  ""We bought all of it,"" said Mr Deka, adding it was enough to last the pigs a year.  Keeping the pygmy hogs and the breeding centres secure is especially important now, Mr Deka said, because officials say the virus has already begun spreading in wild boars in the region, making the contagion more difficult to contain.  Even though Mr Deka says he is preoccupied with swine fever, the coronavirus pandemic has dried up funding desperately needed for the new bio-security measures and staff training.  Some charities said they could no longer afford to give aid, while revenue from the zoo run by Durrell Conservation Trust has also dipped.  ""I believe that when you make a change, it will be hard in the beginning, messy in the middle and good at the end,"" he said. ""Right now, we are between the hard and messy stage.""

According to the Washington Times, Portland-based author Lois Leveen tweeted on her now-private Twitter account a thread about how the film perpetuates systemic racism through its depiction of police in school.  Leveen tweeted, âThereâs nothing entertaining about the presence of police in schools, which feeds the âschool-to-prisonâ pipeline in which African American, Latinx, and other kids of color are criminalized rather than educated. The author continued by writing, âCriminalizing of children increases dramatically when cops work in schools.â  She then said, âYes, KINDERGARTEN COP is only a movie. So are BIRTH OF A NATION and GONE WITH THE WIND, but we recognize films like those are not âgood family fun.ââ  The Northwest Film Center quickly responded to Leveenâs complaints that she was not the only one to voice dissatisfaction in their choice to show Kindergarten Cop and that they would now be pulling the film from the summer drive-in series.  Instead of showing the 1990 comedy, they will now be having a second showing of the documentary John Lewis: Good Trouble in honor of the late Congressman.  The documentary about Lewisâ life as a civil rights activist was already scheduled to be part of the summer drive-in series but sold out quickly, so the Northwest Film Center took the opportunity to give more moviegoers the opportunity to watch.  Another tweet from Northwest Film Center announced, âAfter discussion with staff and community members, however, we agreed that at this moment in history, John Lewis: Good Trouble is the right film to open this yearâs Drive-In series.â",https://www.standard.co.uk/insider/alist/kindergarten-cop-pulled-from-portland-theatre-after-complaints-a4517676.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,eb9b9332e39b14a402d846a8b8353aff305ec9bc6a80b7575cbb6a1a2821f7f5,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Getty Images 5/25 Van Halen Thereâs a famous scene in Back to the Future where Marty McFly plays his father â then a teenager in 50s America â a Van Halen track to try and convince him heâs an alien. Itâs a great moment, which reflects the impact Van Halen had upon pop culture at large. Eddie Van Halen's guitar playing was so incredibly ahead of its time that for many, he was the second coming of Hendrix. It wasn't all fretboard pyrotechnics, though: the success of tracks like Jump proved that the group could write huge tunes, too. Getty Images 6/25 Blondie US new wave never got more urgent and essential than Blondie, who were key players in the New York scene of the mid to late 70s. Debbie Harryâs group brought fantastic energy, razor-sharp riffs and unforgettable songs to the fore throughout the decade. Fans were also delighted to see the group reform in the late 90s for a string of albums and memorable live shows. Getty Images for Amazon Tickets 7/25 The Byrds Roger McGuinnâs chiming 12-string guitar playing became one of the most influential and most frequently imitated sounds of the era after the Byrds emerged in the mid 60s. Original compositions like Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season) and Eight Miles High, as well as unforgettable Bob Dylan covers My Back Pages and Mr Tambourine Man made an indelible mark and the bandâs psychedelic approach to folk rock would go on to influence countless musicians in the years that followed. PA 8/25 The Velvet Underground In the famous words of Brian Eno, âThe first Velvet Underground album only sold 10,000 copies, but everyone who bought it formed a band.â Lou Reedâs New York art rockers received a fraction of the commercial success they deserved during their career, but they list among the most influential rock bands of the 60s and 70s. With Andy Warhol on board as their manager from 1965 the band approached their performances like art shows rather than live gigs, pushing boundaries and convention throughout their career. Much like their contemporaries Iggy Pop & the Stooges, the band came to have a huge impact on the music industry after initially enjoying limited commercial appeal. Getty Images 9/25 The Pixies The Pixies were amongst the pioneers of the 90s alternative scene, becoming one of the most distinctive and revered bands of the era thanks to the unique blending of surf rock, psychedelia and grunge in their music. Their dynamic sound, evocative wordplay and characteristic use of âloud-quietâ song formats would go on to influence the work of contemporaries Nirvana and many others. The Boston group found a new wave of fans after their track was used to devastating effect in the climactic scene of David Fincherâs Fight Club in 1999. Getty Images 10/25 The Band The Band first came to prominence as Bob Dylanâs backing band in the 1960s, before launching their own career with debut album Music from Big Pink. Their rootsy Americana sound and inspired songwriting helped the American-Canadian group become of the of the most critically-lauded groups of the decade. Their classic track The Weight, which was used in classic 1969 film Easy Rider and covered by Diana Ross & The Supremes & The Temptations in the same year, has gone on to become an American standard. Getty Images 11/25 The Strokes New Yorkers The Strokes were hailed as savours of guitar music after breaking through in the early 00s. The group, led by frontman Julian Casablancas and guitarist Albert Hammond Jr, single-handedly made rock music hip again after dance and manufactured pop dominated the charts in the years immediately following Britpop. The groupâs debut Is This It marked one of the most critically acclaimed albums of its time and the bandâs ineffable cool endures to this day. 12/25 Pearl Jam The other great rock band from Seattle, Eddie Vedderâs Pearl Jam became one of the most popular alternative rock acts of the 90s and helped spearhead the hugely influential grunge movement in the US. The band first made their breakthrough with debut album Ten in 1991 and never looked back, selling an estimated 60 million records worldwide. Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images 13/25 Metallica Metallica helped to shape the sound of contemporary heavy metal after forming in 1981. The formidable qualities of frontman James Hetfieldâs delivery with the dexterous drumming of Lars Ulrich and the virtuoso guitar stylings of Kirk Hammett all sync perfectly together on classic tracks such as Enter Sandman, Nothing Else Matters and Master of Puppets, which continue to inform and inspire metal and heavy rock musicians. Dave Benett 14/25 Steely Dan LA hipsters Donald Fagan and Walter Becker formed Steely Dan in the early 70s, producing a style of smooth rock inflected with jazz, R&B and soul. Their back catalogue features some of the most virtuosic musicianship youâre likely to find on mainstream rock records and itâs little wonder that so many artists cite them as an inspiration. Founding member Walter Becker sadly passed away in 2017, but the bandâs legacy will live on for generations. Getty Images 15/25 Talking Heads Talking Heads were one of the celebrated bands who played regularly at the legendary CBGBs club in New York, which helped establish some of the most influential new wave bands of the 70s and 80s. David Byrneâs distinctive vocal delivery (not to mention his penchant for oversized suits) gave the band their distinctive post-punk sound, while they also boasted one of the funkiest and most formidable rhythm sections in rock, the form of bassist Tina Weymouth and drummer Chris Frantz. Reuters 16/25 Rage Against the Machine An inspired melding of rap and thrash metal made Rage a pretty unique proposition for rock fans in the early 90s. As well as producing a string of killer tunes the group also gained reputation as one of the most overtly political bands of the decade too, with revolutionary messages featuring in many of their lyrics. Their politics would play a further role years later, when fans successfully campaigned to make their track Killing in the Name Christmas number one in the UK in a protest against the X Factor in 2009. Getty Images 17/25 Bon Jovi Bon Jovi are one of the most commercially successful US rock bands of all time, with more than a 100 million albums sold and followers all over the world. The glam metal of Livinâ On a Prayer, Bad Medicine and You Give Love a Bad Name and the bombastic balladry of Bed Of Roses and Dead or Alive helped make them a powerhouse in the 80s and the group continue to sell-out arenas. Simone Joyner/Getty Images 18/25 Fleetwood Mac While Fleetwood Mac were in fact formed as a blues rock group in London in 1967, it was the reincarnation of the band as FM rockers in LA that proved to be the groupâs most commercially successful move. American musicians Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks joined the group, taking their sound in a dramatic new direction. The best-selling album 1977 Rumours and the impact of tracks like The Chain, Go Your Own Way, Everywhere and Dreams made them one of the most successful groups of the generation with an enduring musical legacy. 19/25 The Ramones The Ramones might be more familiar to many as a t-shirt rather than a band these days, but the groupâs impact on US rock culture cannot be understated. The group were pioneers of the US punk scene in the mid 70s, proving the perfect antidotes to the overblown and indulgent prog rock movement earlier in that decade. The groupâs songs rarely stretched past the two and a half minute mark, but their deeply melodic approach to songwriting set them apart from their contemporaries. 20/25 Guns N' Roses Hard rock legends Guns Nâ Roses earned a reputation as âthe most dangerous band in the worldâ in the late 80s, embodying the rock and roll excesses of the era unlike any other. Their debut album Appetite for Destruction racked up sales of around 30 million worldwide, with standout single Sweet Child Oâ Mine spring-boarding the group to international acclaim. The bandâs more recent efforts have been slightly less convincing, with long-awaited album Chinese Democracy proving a flop back in 2008, but the group remain one of the most successful acts of their generation. Getty Images 21/25 R.E.M. R.E.M combined country, stadium rock and indie to create some of the most compelling music of the 80s and 90s. The unmistakable vocals of frontman Michael Stipe and the vastly underrated lead guitar work of Peter Buck underpinned the groupâs sound throughout their career, which spanned from their formation in Georgia in 1980 until their split in 2011. Whether you prefer the groupâs idiosyncratic early material or the breakthrough mainstream success of albums such as Out of Time and Automatic for the People, the band represent one of the most intriguing groups of their era with plenty to discover across their extensive back catalogue. Getty Images 22/25 The Eagles Itâs testament to the bandâs appeal that the Eagles sold over 100 million records in the US alone, with their music proving incredibly popular over the past five decades. Their carefree brand of soft rock on hits like Take it Easy and Hotel California is just about as quintessentially American as it gets and you can hear the heat of their native California reflected in The Eaglesâ sun-drenched sound. As well as fabulous songwriting and crystalline harmonies, the bandâs music features some of the slickest guitar playing youâre ever likely to hear courtesy of Joe Walsh. Getty Images 23/25 Aerosmith No-one did stadium rock quite like Aerosmith in their pomp. Steve Tyler and co formed way back in 1970 and the sheer longevity of the group is impressive in itself. Their first top 10 single Dream On came in 1976, while their biggest hit I Donât Want to Miss a Thing topped the charts 22 years later in 1998. As well as representing one of the biggest acts of the last forty years with more than 150 million record sales to their name, Tylerâs group are also responsible for one of the first (and one of the best) rock/hip hop collaborations, the Run DMC mash-up Walk This Way. Jason Merritt/Getty Images for John Varvatos 24/25 The Beach Boys The Beach Boys blended surf rock with unforgettable pop melodies and stunning harmonies, creating a musical niche all of their own after forming in 1961. There was a joyous precision to the groupâs songwriting that set them above their contemporaries, while few acts before or since used the record studio in such pioneering ways or with such boundless invention. 1966âs Pet Sounds is one of the most lauded classic American albums ever released and Brian Wilson remains one of the most revered figures in the industry. Getty Images 25/25 Nirvana Nirvana united a generation in the early 90s when Kurt Cobain become an unlikely poster boy for the disenchanted, disenfranchised twenty-somethings of the age. The groupâs raucous rock arrangements and Cobainâs trademark drawl spoke to Generation X in a way that few had done before, but that was far from the extent of their appeal. Their finely-crafted songwriting and keen pop sensibilities also gave the group an inter-generational musical appeal which many bands involved in the 90s alternative rock movement would never manage. The universal quality and fervour to the bandâs music helped to make them one of the greatest bands ever, with Cobain rightly remembered as the great rock anti-hero of his time. Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic 1/25 Red Hot Chili Peppers Californians Red Hot Chili Peppers became the USâs most prominent funk rockers after forming in 1983. Bass player Flea and former guitarist John Fruscianti are widely regarded as some of the best musicians of their generation, while songs like Californication and Under the Bridge and proved some of the most popular tracks of the 90s. The bandâs longevity is testament to their worldwide appeal and you can guarantee the band will still be jumping around shirtless on stage for years to come. AFP/Getty Images 2/25 Foo Fighters After playing drums in one of the most revered bands of the 21st century, Dave Grohl formed Foo Fighters following the death of Nirvanaâs Kurt Cobain in 1994 in a bid to find a new creative outlet. The band went on to achieve enormous commercial success, releasing their 12th album Concrete and Gold in 2017 and selling-out arenas around the world. Rex Features 3/25 Crosby, Stills & Nash Nothing personifies the great Americana rock of the 60s and 70s quite like the harmonies of Crosby, Stills & Nash. The group were sporadically joined by Neil Young throughout their career and created some of the greatest folk-rock records of the age. Ohio, which was written by Young in reaction to the Kent State Shootings of 1970 and performed by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, remains one of the finest protest songs ever recorded. Getty Images for NARAS 4/25 The Doors The Doors made a huge impact on US rock in the space of six short years after forming in Los Angeles in 1965. Iconic frontman Jim Morrisonâs vitriolic and frequently unhinged delivery was a key characteristic of the bandâs sound, but the keyboard stylings of Ray Manzarek were just as significant. Their unique emphasis on organ-led tracks and psychedelic arrangements saw the band ingrain themselves into the rock zeitgeist before Morrisonâs untimely death in 1971.

The global protests and their fallout has forced a slew of industries and individuals to shine an ultraviolet light on themselves and the racial prejudices they may or may not have perpetuated.  From publishing to print media, music to modelling, thereâs been no facet left unturned as stark inequalities have come to light.  This is particularly true of the fashion industry, which has experienced something of a reckoning in recent weeks, causing CEOs and companies alike to offer messages of remorse to their customers followed by promises of reparations.  Itâs in the wake of the tumult that two of New York's fashion industry heavyweights, Lindsay Peoples Wagner, Editor in Chief of Teen Vogue, and Sandrine Charles, owner of Sandrine Charles Consulting, announced the launch of their organisation, the Black in Fashion Council.  âOur mission is to focus on amplifying the voices of Black people in the industry,â Peoples Wagner tells the Standard. âWhether youâre a freelancer an assistant or an executive, you have a part in this industry and we want to make sure that you are allowed and celebrated in all of these spaces.â  The pairâs idea is simple: brands can sign on to work with the BIFCâs 400-strong council which comprises tastemakers from all across the fashion industry to ensure that their work is appropriate, inclusive and diverse.  Working on the idea that âchange doesnât happen overnightâ, brands will have to sign on for a minimum term of three years, which, Peoples Wagner says, is because âwe want to create a relationship and a two-way street to have conversations with people and brands, so they can be proactive rather than reactive.â  Next year, the BIFC will implement its own Corporate Equality Index, in a bid to address brandsâ diversity levels. If the score is low, the council will recommend ways to improve it.  âThe combination of allowing people to have the conversations and giving people the chance of rising to the opportunity of changing, but then also introducing a fair index will really give people that balance that we need in terms of accountability,â Peoples Wagner states.  The genesis of the BIFC came several years ago. In 2018, Peoples Wagner penned a viral piece for The Cut, titled What It's Really Like to Be Black and Work in Fashion.  She explains: âWe talk so much about how fashionâs a progressive industry but writing that really shed a light on things that needed to change and the impact of that really bought us into the starting of the Black in Fashion Council because weâve been having so many conversations about so many things in the industry that need to be uprooted.â  Charles, whose previous clients include Kith, Ivy Park, and Nordstrom x Nike, expands: âWe spoke a couple of weeks ago in light of everything going on in the industry and the US and it really sparked a conversation between Lindsay and myself. We were thinking about how we can establish change in our industry, so we connected with about 50 of our peers and from there, the council was birthed.â  Unfortunately for the pair - who have been friends for eight years and met through work - news of the council was prematurely leaked ahead of its official launch next month.  âI actually think itâs helped because itâs helped us to have these conversations early. Weâre excited to properly announce with the full website with all of the details for everyone,â Charles adds.  Already the âcollaborative collectiveâ has appointed more than 35 board members, including GQ Deputy Fashion Director Nikki Ogunnaike, Vice President of Brand and Culture Engagement at Gucci Antoine Phillips, Cosmopolitan Beauty Director Julee Wilson, and Saks Fifth Avenue Vice President Jamillah Davis Hernandez. These board members are split into groups with focus points ranging from retail to models and corporations to emerging brands.  Peoples Wagner wrote another piece for The Cut on street style photographerâs notorious fetishisation of thin, white women during fashion week, which is an aspect of the industry the council is also tackling. Charles mentions that she is in talks with a âcollective of some of the most prominent Black photographers in the States to not only collaborate but also to integrate them in our efforts.â  âYes, that situation needs to be more inclusive, but it really also falls on the publications to make sure theyâre commissioning the right photographers, for whom inclusivity is a part of how they see everything,â Peoples Wagner suggests. âItâs a tag team of both sides, which is why this is such a big tackle for sure.â  The Black in Fashion Councilâs launch comes at a pivotal time in societyâs acceptance and realisation of centuries worth of racial inequalities.  Peoples Wagner concedes, âBlack Lives Matter has always been at the front of black peopleâs minds, I think that this moment is just very different in time because it has forced white people to understand the privilege that they have.â  The pair are unsure where the Black in Fashion Council will be in five yearsâ time; theyâre taking it one step at a time ahead of the organisationâs official launch next month which will have a âfleshed outâ description of all that the Council will offer.  âItâs really having that conversation with people because there are a million problems in the industry and itâs not just a blanket statement of one thing that people can do,â Peoples Wagner concludes.

2020-08-06 13:22:25.232899,"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 07:41:46 GMT",Trump denies helping Kanye West's bid to get on the 2020 ballot,"Donald Trump has denied any involvement after reports suggested Republicans are aiding Kanye Westâs 2020 presidential election bid.  Since rapper West, who has previously supported Donald Trump, announced he was joining the race to the White House in July, sceptics have accused Republicans of encouraging the 43-year-old to run in order to siphon votes away from Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.  A report by CNN said longtime Republican lawyer Lane Ruhland, who has ties to the Trump campaign, dropped signatures off at the Wisconsin election board in a bid to get West added to the state ballot.  New York Magazine also reported how Republican operative Gregg Keller is listed as the West campaign contact in Arkansas, while Chuck Wilton, a Vermont Republican who is listed as a possible electoral college elector for Trump, is also cited as a possible elector for West.  But Trump, 74, has distanced himself from these claims, telling reporters at his daily briefing he had ânothing to doâ with getting West on the ballot â before laying praise on both the rapper and his wife Kim Kardashian.  âNo not at all,â the president said in response to questions about his involvement. âOther that I get along with him [West] very well, I like him, I like his wife.  ""His wife has recommended certain people to get people out of prison, they were in prison for a long time. A long, long time, it should have never happened.  âI took what she said very strong. Sheâs got a very good heart.""

The 29-year-old doctor and her new husband, Ahmad Subeih, 34, are now still struggling to process what has happened to their home city.  Instead of a cherished memory, the couple's wedding video now serves as high-definition documentary evidence of a tragedy that killed at least 135 people and injured more than 5,000 .  The President of Lebanon, Michel Aoun, has said the blast, which occurred around 6pm local time on Tuesday and was felt as far away as Cyprus, was caused by 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate being stored unsafely in a warehouse in the port area.

Hospitals in the city, already struggling with the coronavirus crisis, quickly filled with the injured.  Ms Seblani, who rushed to help the wounded nearby after the impact, told Reuters: ""When I woke up and saw the damage that happened to Beirut, the one thing I said was thank God we are still alive.  âWhat happened during the explosion here - there is no word to explain ...

She described the scene at the venue when they returned to collect their passports the next day as ""unbelievable"".

Clemmie Hambro, 44, said she was ""completely horrified"" by the revelations against Epstein.  It comes after it emerged that she took two flights on Epstein's jet in 1999, according to flight logs seen by the Daily Mail that were released in court proceedings.  The records apparently show that she visited the convicted sex offender's New Mexico ranch and Little St James in the US Virgin Islands, where he is said to have spent years abusing young girls.  Ms Hambro, Sir Winston Churchill's great-granddaughter, told the publication in a statement that her ""heart breaks for all the survivors"".  She said that she did not suffer or witness any abuse, adding that she hopes those who did ""get the justice they so deserve"".  At the point she made the trips in 1999, Ms Hambro was a 23-year-old employee at Christieâs auction house in New York.  She said she visited the ranch on a ""work trip"" to help Epstein decide what art he wanted to buy while another was a ""personal invitation"" to the Caribbean island.  Eight years before his conviction, records show Epstein was with Ms Hambro on both flights and that British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, 58, was also present for one trip.  The flight logs unearthed by the Mail reveal that on February 21, 1999, Ms Hambro flew with Epstein, Maxwell and two other women from Santa Fe, where Epstein had his âZorro Ranchâ, to New Yorkâs Teterboro airport.  A month later, on March 21, she was on his jet from St Thomas, used by Epstein to access Little St James, to Teterboro.  In a statement last night, Ms Hambro told the publication: ""My heart breaks for all the survivors, now I know what happened on that island.  ""In the course of those two trips, I was not abused, nor did I see anyone abused, or anything untoward happen, with minors or otherwise.  ""I have been completely horrified about the revelations of his conduct since then. I was clearly very lucky, my heart goes out to those who were abused by him, and I trust they get the justice they so deserve.""  Ms Hambro was the youngest bridesmaid at the wedding of Lady Diana Spencer and Prince Charles in July 1981 aged 5.  Little St James is at the centre of abuse allegations against Epstein, who took his own life in jail a year ago.  Maxwell is awaiting trial for aiding Epstein in his abuse. She denies all the allegations.",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/princess-diana-bridesmaid-jeffrey-epstein-island-guest-a4517926.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,8a0cc6fa550c3d5765e0d57ecfa91c5dfb15dc8d88a54e2b948accd18d4970b6,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Quaden Bayles, who was born with achondroplasia, was filmed by his mother earlier this year saying ""I just want to die"" in a video which attracted widespread attention on social media and was viewed millions of times.  The footage led to an outpouring of support from celebrities, including from comedian Brad Williams, who set up a fundraising page for the young boy to go to Disneyland which raised more than 300,000 Australian dollars (Â£165,000) in just a few days.  His mother, Yarraka Bayles, said the purpose of the video was to show ""the effect that bullying has"" and the family later pledged to give all the money raised for Quaden to charity.  But the Bayles family faced accusations from some quarters that they had staged the incident in order to scoop the donations that poured in from supporters.  Among those to make the claim was Australian columnist Miranda Devine, who retweeted a post from Twitter user @bubblebathgirl claiming that Quaden was an actor and the footage of him sobbing was not genuine.  Ms Devine said: âThatâs really rotten if this was a scam. Hurts genuine bullying victims.â  The News Corp employee later posted a Tweet saying that she had shared her initial retweet of the theory with ""caution"", but also alleged that Quaden's mother had been ""coaching the kid to say those things that no nine-year-old would say"".  Picking up on Ms Devine's comments, the Bayles family filed a defamation lawsuit against the columnist and her employer, News Corp Australia, last Friday, local media reported.  The statement of claim says Ms Devine's Tweet was defamatory because it carried the imputations that Quaden had âdishonestly acted out being distressed in a video to obtain money from donorsâ and that he had dishonestly pretended to be the victim of bullying, thereby hurting genuine victims of bullyingâ, the Guardian newspaper reported, citing documents lodged in the federal court on Monday.  It also implied that his mother had âposted online a video of her son knowing it falsely depicted him as being distressed, to get donationsâ and that she had âdishonestly coached her son to pretend to be distressed to get donationsâ.  Ms Devine and News Corp Australia are yet to file a legal defence to the legal action, local media reported.",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/quaden-bayles-sues-miranda-devine-for-defamation-a4517851.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,4576023e0a597a710326b47a4a36c00bd61c0d71e1921cfe232ad51937efc40c,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Scot Miller, 43, was battling Covid-19 in intensive care when his mother and her partner were killed by the disease, he told the BBC.  Mr Miller shared a flat in Edinburgh with his mother Norma, 76, who had dementia, and her 69-year-old partner.  It was only when he was brought out of a medically-induced coma that he found out about their deaths.  The 43-year-old said: ""When I was upstairs in ICU fighting for my life, my mum was in a ward downstairs, basically passing away.""  He said he first noticed something was wrong on March 21 when his mother had a fall and he was unable to get her back on her feet.  An ambulance took her to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where she tested positive for the virus.  Meanwhile Mr Miller, too, was succumbing to the disease and by the end of the week he had been admitted to the same hospital, in a critical condition.  His sister-in-law Sharlene Miller told the BBC: ""On the Sunday morning we got a call to say Norma had passed away, and we got a call from the consultant to say that Scott was very ill as well.  âThen Norma's partner passed away the following Sunday.""  After three weeks in intensive care, the 43-year-oldâs condition improved and he was brought out of the coma.  A nurse then informed him of his motherâs death.  ""When I came round, I just had a gut feeling that something had happened to mum and when the nurse told me it was just disbelief and shock. It was very hard,"" he said.  Four months on, Mr Miller is continuing his recovery and has no idea when he will be well enough to return to work.

The blast on Tuesday evening killed at least 135 people, injured more than 5,000 others and damaged up to 300,000 homes in Lebanon's capital.  Hundreds of buildings were destroyed or disfigured by the explosion, which officials have linked to some 2,750 tonnes of confiscated ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse at the city's port for several years.  But amid the chaos, photojournalist Bilal Jawich documented the extraordinary efforts of the nurse at Al Roum hospital, in the Ashrafieh district, which sits just a few kilometres from the port.  Mr Jawich had headed to the area after seeing a massive plume of smoke rise into the air.  ""I followed the smoke until I reached the port of Beirut,"" he told CNN Arabic, adding that ""professional intuition"" eventually took him to Al Roum hospital.

The photojournalist said the nurse had recounted to him how she was knocked unconscious inside the maternity ward when the initial blast hit before later coming to, clutching the three babies.  But not everybody at the hospital survived the explosion, according to the facility's emergency preparedness and disaster manager, George Saad.  Mr Saad told CNN that 12 patients, two visitors and four nurses had been killed by the blast, while two people remain in critical condition.

The pair, who spent last season on loan from Southampton and Bournemouth respectively, are both firm favourites of Parker and keen on a stay at Craven Cottage.  Parker himself is set to extend his deal with the club having secured promotion, with talks to begin when they return from short breaks. The 39-year-old and his coaching staff were handed two-year deals in May 2019.  Reed has informed Southampton of his desire for a regular starting place, and while manager Ralph Hasenhuttl is an admirer of the 25-year-old, he cannot give such assurances despite the expected loss of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg to Tottenham.  Fulham remain in talks with the south coast club but are confident of sealing a deal worth around Â£8million for the tenacious midfielder.  Arter's loan deal included an obligation to buy for Â£4m had he made a certain number of starts. Despite that number not being met, Fulham remain keen on striking a deal with Bournemouth for the 30-year-old, with the relegated Cherries thought to be happy to let Arter make the permanent switch to Craven Cottage alongside brother-in-law Parker.  The Fulham boss has made it clear that they will not repeat the Â£100million spending spree of two summers ago which disrupted their promotion winning side and saw them plummet back to the Championship. They will, however, still have to invest in the squad, and are looking at adding another winger and striker as support for last season's top scorer, Aleksandar Mitrovic.

Hereâs how to get your Â£5,000 voucher","I would like to receive the latest property news and guides, every Wednesday by email  register with your social account or click here to log in  You already have an account. Please log in  Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the Green Homes Grant at the start of July.  The grant means homeowners can get up to Â£5,000 to spend making heating their houses more efficient and environmentally-friendly.  It will also create new work for builders and other tradespeople, and possibly thousands of jobs - which could be vital at a point where many people are losing employment.  But what is the Green Homes Grant? And how can you get a voucher for your home?  The Â£2 billion Green Homes Grant is intended to help people in the UK cut carbon emissions, which is vital if the country is to meet its promise to have net zero emissions by 2050.  The grant provides funding for homeowners to bring in energy efficiency measures.  This means that homes should be able to stay warm for longer, meaning people can use less energy heating their houses - which would be good for the environment.  What can you do with the grant?  The grant covers up to two thirds the cost of improvements to make homes more energy efficient.  The improvements homeowners can make on grant money are split into two categories.  To get any money, homeowners have to insulate either a solid wall, a cavity wall, under-floor areas, loft, flat roof, a room in their roof, or a park home, or install low-carbon heating measures like solar thermal systems or ground or air source heat pumps.  If homeowners already have these features, they can apply for grant money to improve them.  If they do this, they can also get funding for other features like draught proofing, double or triple glazing, or secondary glazing, and heating controls like appliance thermostats, hot water tank thermostats or smart heating controls.  You cannot get more money for secondary features than you can for primary. For example, if you got Â£2,000 for insulating a solid wall and installing a solar thermal system, you could not get more than Â£2,000 for putting in double glazing and heating controls.  The scheme is expected to save homeowners up to Â£600 per year in energy bills, and create 100,000 jobs, the Government said.  Who is eligible?  The scheme is expected to help owners of around 600,000 homes make their properties more energy efficient.  Anyone who lives in a home that they own. This includes long-leaseholders and homes with shared ownership.  Landlords of homes rented out privately or for social rent are also eligible, while park home owners, including gypsy and traveller sites qualify for the scheme too.  But new-build homes are not eligible.  Homeowners on various kinds of benefits like Jobseekerâs Allowance are eligible for a bigger grant of up to Â£10,000 for the improvements - covering the entire cost of the refurbishments.  What about renters?  The government also plans to spend Â£500 million to support people on low incomes with their fuel costs, including renters.  How can you apply?  Later in August homeowners can get advice on how to make their home more energy efficient from Simple Energy Advice (SEA).  SEA will tell homeowners what areas of the property may be eligible for funding.  A list of government-accredited builders and tradespeople will also be available to choose from. Once the work is agreed the Government will hand out vouchers from the end of September.",https://www.standard.co.uk/homesandproperty/green-homes-grant-start-date-how-apply-a4517916.html,http://www.standard.co.uk/rss,37eb80ad30a56f0ce734ca4fbdc8856433225d66d358aa3d3423ad26193118a4,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

At least 135 people were killed and 5,000 injured in the blast. Such devastation would be difficult to deal with at the best of times but it hit the Lebanese capital in the midst of a severe economic crisis that has only been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Before the blast, Lebanonâs currency had plummeted to record lows, losing more than 80% of its value since October 2019. The Lebanese pound has been officially pegged to the US dollar since 1997 at the rate of LÂ£1,500 to US$1, with the two currencies largely used interchangeably. But this exchange rate has long been untenable.  This is because the nationâs government debt levels have for years been among the highest in the world, as were current account deficits (the difference between a countryâs imports of goods and services and exports). Lebanon produces little and depends heavily on imports, including most of its food. It was borrowing heavily to pay for these imports.  This would usually prompt capital to leave the country, making the value of the currency fall. For years, however, the country avoided this fate. Local banks were happy to lend to the government because they were receiving exorbitantly high interest rates. The fact that many politicians held stakes in the banks cemented this cosy relationship between government and finance. Meanwhile, the countryâs large diaspora was happy to deposit US dollars they had earned elsewhere in Lebanese banks. Friendly Gulf governments also provided financial assistance.  Yet by 2016, even the countryâs loyal diaspora started getting cold feet about depositing money back in Lebanon and relations with the Gulf grew frostier. Capital flows into Lebanon slowed down. To try and keep money flowing in, the central bank then engaged in complex borrowing arrangements with local banks which it described as âfinancial engineeringâ but critics have labelled a Ponzi scheme.  But economic confidence was not restored and by September 2019 the central bank could no longer stem the flow of money leaving the country. With capital flight in full swing, banks started rationing the amount of dollars that people could withdraw from their accounts. The prospect that Lebanese savers would be unable to access hard-earned dollars or that their Lebanese pounds would lose value led to rising panic.  To raise revenues and present a picture of greater fiscal probity, the government then proposed new taxes on tobacco, petrol and voice calls via messaging services like WhatsApp. This was the straw that broke the camelâs back. Thousands of people took to the streets to protest the tax along with wider issues of corruption, forcing the government to resign. But the currency plummeted as the new government under the next prime minister, Hassan Diab failed to develop a coherent strategy to tackle the countryâs problems.  EPA-EFE / Wael Hamzeh  The collapse of the Lebanese pound means imports have become very expensive. Inflation is skyrocketing, causing unprecedented levels of economic hardship for Lebanese families. World Bank estimates from before coronavirus and the latest tragedy suggested poverty could rocket from a third to 50% of the population.  Wider failures  The collapse of Lebanonâs financial system is symptomatic of a wider failure of governance which goes back to the policies adopted after the end of the countryâs civil war in 1990. Lebanonâs political class recruits itself from a narrow pool of families, many of whom have been in power for decades.  They claim to represent Lebanonâs many sects and government posts are shared according to a rigid formula based on the countryâs religious communities. This system enables politicians to divide up economic spoils and enrich themselves â just as they did with the profits from banks they held stakes in.  Foreign powers from Iran and Saudi Arabia to the US and France have long indulged Lebanonâs leaders. They hoped that aid would gain them influence in this strategically important country.  The explosion of the port fits into the pattern of failed governance in Lebanon. Initial reports suggest that port officials were aware of the dangers posed by the store of ammonium nitrate that caused the explosion. Only an impartial investigation could uncover full culpability. The neglect and incompetence at the centre of this disaster are typical of the myriad failures replicated across the state.  Solutions may emerge as many Lebanese look beyond their failing state and corrupt politicians. The day after the explosion, Beirutâs streets were filled with the sound of glass being swept up as thousands of people worked together without much support from official agencies in sight.  EPA-EFE Brahim Dirani / Dar Al Mussawir  But destruction is widespread. Dwellings are damaged within a six-mile radius and initial estimates suggest 300,000 are homeless. Hospitals that were already struggling to cope with the first wave of COVID-19 cases, are stretched beyond capacity.  There are concerns over food supplies as the national wheat silo was hit and Beirutâs port damaged, which will further curtail the governmentâs ability to import food. A humanitarian crisis would also affect Lebanonâs estimated 1.5 million Syrian refugees and 270,000 Palestinian refugees.  Various European and Arab governments have rushed emergency aid to Beirut for immediate recovery. A possible rescue package from the International Monetary Fund promises much needed funds but would also impose austerity and privatisation. The latest negotiations with the fund recently broke down over the inability of Lebanese politicians to present a united front.  The immediate future looks bleak and will likely see large-scale emigration. The explosion erodes what little trust citizens may still have had in their political class and long-term solutions require nothing short of fundamental political change.",https://theconversation.com/how-beiruts-port-explosion-exacerbates-lebanons-economic-crisis-144040,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,fc0177c2fb8e5a7fe21572d958ab0517a698a42635f6bad7eae68c3237522975,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:29.577884,2020-08-06T11:46:11Z,Link between autism and eating disorders may be due to an inability to identify emotions â new research,"Eating disorders have the highest mortality rates of any mental illness. They donât discriminate, affecting people of all ethnicities, sexualities, gender identities, ages and backgrounds. However, one group is disproportionately affected by these disorders: people on the autism spectrum.  Eating disorders in autistic people are poorly understood, but they tend to be more severe and long-lasting. The longer a person lives with their eating disorder, the harder it is to recover. This may partly explain why some studies suggest autistic people have a poorer prognosis in therapy.  Longer-lasting eating disorders are associated with a greater likelihood of death. The fact that autistic people are vulnerable to chronic eating disorders, alongside other mental illnesses, may be one reason why they die one to three decades earlier, on average, than non-autistic people.  So why are autistic people more vulnerable to eating disorders? A couple of reasons have been suggested.  Dieting  One general and major risk factor for developing an eating disorder is dieting. For people who might already be genetically vulnerable to eating disorders, dieting seems to kick-start something in the brain that can develop the disorder.  While autistic people arenât more likely to diet than the average person, certain features of autism â including attention to detail, determination and intense fixated interests â may make them better able to maintain the restrictions needed for long-term weight loss when they choose to diet.  The cognitive rigidity that we see in autistic people may also make it easy for them to get stuck in patterns of eating behaviour, while their preference for sameness may cause them to have a limited diet to begin with. For some autistic people, insensitivity to hunger, gastrointestinal problems and sensitivity to tastes, smells and textures make eating difficult anyway.  Moreover, because autistic people are often bullied and socially isolated, dieting and weight loss may give them back a sense of control, predictability, reward and self-worth. Eating disorders may even numb feelings of anxiety and depression.  Alexithymia  A core feature of people with eating disorders is that they find it difficult to identify and cope with emotion. As autistic people struggle with emotions in similar ways, our research team wondered whether this might help explain why they are more likely to have eating disorders.  The personality trait characterised by an inability to identify and describe emotions is called alexithymia. Being alexithymic is like being emotionally colour-blind, and it ranges from subtle to severe. While one alexithymic person might find it hard to pinpoint what emotion theyâre feeling, another might notice physical signs such as a racing heart and be able to identify theyâre feeling angry or frightened.  Alexithymia is associated with many negative outcomes like suicide and self-injury. In part, this may be because people who cannot identify or express their emotions find it hard to soothe themselves or get support from others.  To see whether alexithymia might contribute to eating disorders in autism, we looked at eating-disorder symptoms and autistic traits in the general population. Autism is a spectrum disorder, so everyone has some level of autistic traits - it does not mean they are actually autistic. Nevertheless, these traits can tell us something about the nature of autism itself.  In two experiments with 421 participants, we found that higher autistic traits correlated with higher eating-disorder symptoms. We also found that higher levels of alexithymia wholly or partially explained this relationship. Our results suggest that having higher autistic traits alongside difficulties identifying and describing emotions may make these people more vulnerable to developing eating-disorder symptoms.  Interestingly, we found differences between male and female participants. While alexithymia was related to eating-disorder symptoms in women, there were no links between alexithymia and eating-disorder symptoms in men. Since the male group was small, however, we couldnât be sure these findings would hold up in a bigger sample.  Next steps  This research canât show conclusively that alexithymia causes eating disorder symptoms in people with autistic traits, or indeed autistic people. It might be that the relationships work backwards, and eating-disorder symptoms give rise to alexithymia and to autistic features.  However, first-person accounts from autistic people are consistent with the idea that alexithymia might play a role in their eating disorders. One participant even described how restricting her calorie intake reduced internal sensations that â unknown to her, being unable to identify them â caused her much anxiety.  If supported by further research, these findings have potential implications for treatment. Clinicians already know that therapies need to be tailored for autistic and non-autistic patients, but how best to achieve this is still uncertain. Preliminary research like this may offer some clue by highlighting alexithymia as a potential target. Alexithymia is currently not addressed by clinicians either in autistic people or in those with eating disorders  As there are many negative outcomes associated with being autistic â such as high suicide rates and greater risk of eating disorders â it will be important to explore how much alexithymia, not autism itself, actually contributes to these negative outcomes. Focused interventions to treat alexithymia might potentially reduce these risks.",https://theconversation.com/link-between-autism-and-eating-disorders-may-be-due-to-an-inability-to-identify-emotions-new-research-143022,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,1b9eaaf1c3592575691cacb8c0fbc3deb0e4a6bee40d634ea5f15ca2b5a5add4,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:30.803685,2020-08-06T10:17:05Z,Four reasons why some people become âsuper smellersâ â from pregnancy to genetic differences,"Do certain smells make you feel uncomfortable, even nauseous? Or is your nose so good that you can detect even the subtlest aromas in your favourite wine? Perhaps certain smells evoke negative or positive feelings? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you might just be a âsuper smellerâ.  Medically known as hyperosmia, super smellers are people who have a heightened sense of smell compared to the average person. Some super smellers may be more sensitive to pleasant smells, while others may be more affected by unpleasant odours.  Hyperosmia is relatively rare, so thereâs still much that researchers donât know about the condition. However, here are some of the reasons a person may have hyperosmia.  1. Health conditions  A number of studies have reported links between various medical conditions and hyperosmia, including Lyme Disease, migraines, body fluid disturbances, hormone deficiency and certain medications. Though itâs not fully understood what leads to hyperosmia in these cases, it could possibly be the effect these diseases have on the bodyâs electrolytes, thus affecting the signals generated at the scent receptors.  Studies have also shown that certain genetic conditions such as duplication or overexpression of the KAL1 gene â which produces a protein (anosmin-1) that appears to control the growth and movement of nerve cells that help process smell â and other genetic mutations are linked to heightened sense of smell.  One study even showed that the genetic coding for a certain protein that helps to bind on to smells and help them reach the smell receptors in the nose, does vary in a population, so some people may naturally have a better sense of smell than others.  2. Pregnancy  Many women who become pregnant often claim certain smells which never used to bother them suddenly become revolting. And one review has actually confirmed that some pregnant women do temporarily become super smellers.  By comparing the findings of more than 50 studies into how pregnancy alters sense of smell, researchers concluded that although pregnant women didnât have higher smell intensity overall, they were possibly more sensitive to certain odours. But there wasnât enough evidence to determine if their ability to identify more odours in general had increased.  Despite being such a commonly reported phenomenon, researchers still arenât entirely sure why this happens. However, this sensitivity is typically temporary, rather than a permanent change.  3. Brain differences  A 2019 study aimed to uncover whether the brains of super smellers worked differently than normal. Researchers compared 25 men who considered themselves super smellers with 20 men who rated their sense of smells as normal. Using brain scans, the researchers compared the grey matter volume in parts of the brain associated with smell.  They found that in super smellers there was increased brain activity in two key areas responsible for bringing together smell information, and learning and memorising smells. But while research detected these brain differences, the researchers were unable to ascertain whether this was caused by genetics, or if it was learned.  It is well established that smell and memory are strongly linked. But the findings of a 2014 study suggest that this may be the basis for hyperosmia. The study looked at 55 volunteers who rated their sense of smell as better than average. They compared them to a group of people the same ages and gender who considered their sense of smell to be normal.  The super smellers in this study were asked to complete a structured questionnaire about their experiences of environmental smells. They associated certain smells such as fragrances and human body products (such as sweat) with negative consequences and unpleasant memories, and found that environmental smells evoked feelings of annoyance and disgust. But the study didnât investigate whether participants were also sensitive to other smells, so itâs difficult to know if these volunteers actually had a normal or heightened sense of smell.  Other studies have similarly found that sensitivity to certain smells, including phenolic resins (such as formaldehyde) and the shellfish-like pyridine odour in organic chemicals, are linked with negative experiences, suggesting that sensitivity to these smells develops based on negative experiences in the workplace â for example being exposed to chemical odours at work.  4. Training  So does being a super smeller convey a super power that lasts continuously, or can it be temporary?  In 2003, I conducted a study with 230 volunteers to test their depth of smell for the smell of phenylethyl alcohol (the smell of roses) or eucalyptol (a mint-like smell). The depth of smell relates to how small a concentration of an odour can be detected (known as the âthresholdâ). We used a custom-built device that delivered eight concentrations of the smells, from barely detectable to very strong.  We found that 2% of the group demonstrated what we dubbed as âthe superosmic phenomenonâ on single testing. A further 10% demonstrated this phenomenon on various occasions during repeated testing (where the test was performed ten times on separate occasions at one-week intervals). This phenomenon occurred when the volunteers were able to detect the smells at three or more levels below where they would normally detect it â and they were able to continue detecting the smells at least ten times during the test. The test was performed once a week over a period of ten weeks.  In almost all cases where the superosmia occurred, this was followed by a sudden, rapid loss of smell detection at this lower level before the end of the test. So without any explanation for why, we could see evidence of short-term super smellers when focused on certain smells.  Overall, the assumption all super smellers achieve their âsuperpowerâ because of their genes or a rare medical condition is probably unlikely. Think about sommeliers or perfumers â these people train their noses to be able to recognise many unique smells. In fact, smell training can even allow people who have suffered smell loss to recover their sense of smell.  It seems that super smellers are a mixture of people who may be genetically wired to smell better, some who train to smell better and some who have an underlying medical condition. And others, perhaps including pregnant women, they may only experience smell sensitivity â not true hyperosmia.",https://theconversation.com/four-reasons-why-some-people-become-super-smellers-from-pregnancy-to-genetic-differences-141404,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,513b2663bebb54a9129c5f8d2aa4dd42c6728fd27c9dc62b5fedbc23b85131c4,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The blast, in the early evening of August 4, has been reported as having the force of a 3.5 magnitude earthquake â and is believed to have been fuelled by 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored in a warehouse at the port.  While post-civil war Lebanonâs economy, infrastructure and basic services are already on their knees due to an unprecedented economic crisis, widespread public protest about believed government corruption and recently the COVID-19 pandemic, another portion of Lebanonâs crucial national infrastructure now lies in ruins. The port of Beirut handles 60% of Lebanonâs imports as well as the storage of its food and medical reserves.  The history of a port at Beirut stretches back to as far as the 15th century BC. In the 20th century, Beirut became a key seaport serving the oil trade and related passenger and cargo movements in the Levant and the Gulf.  The port has played a key role in Beirutâs history and stands at the centre of the city, surrounded by some of its most important neighbourhoods.  Divided past  From 1975 until 1990, Lebanon endured a vicious and prolonged civil war. Beirut became the site where sectarian tensions and regional geopolitics became part of urban space. It resulted in profound divisions and changes in the geography of the city. In September 1975, a few months into the civil war, the centre of Beirut became the core of militia fighting.  During the war the city was partitioned by a âGreen Lineâ which split Beirut into an eastern and western sector. Demographic redistributions took place: people moved from one side of the city to the other along sectarian and political lines, with Christians settling mainly to the east and Muslims mainly to the west of the line.  The Green Line gradually progressed from the southern suburbs to the west gate of the harbour. In 1981 the New York Times reported that the port was one of the only places in the city where the Green Line could be crossed.  In the post-war era, the port of Beirut has expanded into a major regional hub seaport. It recently called for tenders for an international bid to manage a container terminal, to the east of where the explosion took place, and has experienced a significant increase in its vessel capacity.  Development and protest  Crucially, the port of Beirut stands adjacent to the most expensive real estate in town: the the Beirut Central District. In the early 1980s, this area was pinpointed for redevelopment, and at the end of the civil war it was the target of one of the biggest investment operations in Lebanese history. The redevelopment was considered controversial due to concerns about a lack of sustainability, inequality with the rest of the city, high property prices, lack of public spaces and costly services.  In 2015 and 2019, this area became the fulcrum of public anti-government protests. Until the interruption of the coronavirus pandemic, protesters took over several buildings and squares in the city centre. They campaigned against government corruption, and â among other things â for the right of access to pubic services and resources. In addition, they called for government accountability amid crumbling infrastructure and services, the loss of public space and environmental decline.  The port of Beirut also stands close to the dense residential areas of Gemmayzeh, Geitawi and the upmarket urban pockets of Sursock and Tabaris, separated only by a motorway. East of the port, and directly adjacent, are the neighbourhoods of Mar Mikhail and Karantina â the Ottoman quarantine station which marked the point of arrival and settlement for successive waves of refugees, including from Armenia in the 1920s and Palestine from the 1940s.  A portrait of the city  This cluster of neighbourhoods hosts many of Lebanonâs state and private services, including the electricity provider (EDL), a bus terminal and three hospitals. Gemmayzeh and Mar Mikhael, in particular, have undergone a process of gentrification in the last decade, prompting protests from residents against demolitions of heritage buildings, noise pollution and soaring property prices.  The popular quarters around the port and the reconstructed city centre present two sides of Beirutâs postwar reconstruction. Top-down regeneration with a master plan has taken place in the Beirut Central District, while a slow-burning gentrification characterises the other neighbourhoods.  It has been reported that operations will shift from Beirutâs devastated port to Lebanonâs other seaport with container capacity in Tripoli, around 80km along the coast. But it cannot be understated how much has been lost in terms of investment in the port of Beirut, and in the surrounding city.",https://theconversation.com/the-port-of-beirut-vital-historic-centre-of-a-complex-city-144022,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,69330aa4335b17ed3a36a0c708978bd9eb364103f508ab7b09b0ce8d5d5da619,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

While the actual cause remains uncertain, the tragedy calls to attention the tremendous consequences of a lack of port security.  The explosion, on August 4, at around 6pm local time, appears to have been fuelled by 2,750 tons of the highly reactive chemical ammonium nitrate. The chemical had been the cargo on a ship, the the MV Rhosus, which entered the port at Beirut in 2013 due to a lack of seaworthiness and was prohibited from sailing. After the shipâs owner abandoned the vessel soon afterwards, the ammonium nitrate remained in a storage facility in Beirutâs port.  While the disaster itself was exceptional, the events leading up to it were not. Hazardous material is shipped across the worldâs oceans on a daily basis. It is often mishandled or illegally traded. Abandoned containers of hazardous goods are found regularly in ports.  While maritime security tends to focus on preventing high-profile events such as piracy, terrorism or cyber-attacks, all too often it is daily mishandling that makes disasters possible. Part of preventing disasters such as what has happened in Beirut will mean strengthening port management and addressing crimes such as smuggling and corruption.  Abandoned ships  The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has recorded 97 cases of abandoned ships and crews since 2017. Ships are abandoned by their owners if a vessel is no longer lucrative to maintain, or perhaps if the ship has been stopped by authorities and fined. While the situation of the seafarers aboard these ships is often tragic, as they may receive little pay or even food for months, what happens to the load of the vessels is often unclear.  And the IMO number only reflects the cases of ships â we know little about how many containers stand abandoned in ports around the world.  A UN report indicates that this number may be large. Containers often lie abandoned within ports, sometimes even by design, fuelled by criminal activities such as waste smuggling and corruption. Despite some efforts to counter this, the issue remains widespread and there are continued obstacles to tackling it.  International waste trade  Shipping companies often sail to Asia with empty containers, as much of the flow of trade is from Asia to Europe. As a result, they are willing to take low-value and high-volume bookings on the initial leg.  This has facilitated a burgeoning waste trade and with it a smuggling sector, where illegal forms of waste such as unrecyclable plastics are shipped from western countries to countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia. Thousands of these containers lie abandoned once they reach the port.  Much of the waste is less dangerous than the ammonium nitrate that fuelled the Beirut explosion, but it can still have dreadful effects. Plastics, for example, can cause hazards if not properly disposed of. Much of it ends up in the ocean, fuelling the ocean plastic crisis.  In 2019, Sri Lankan authorities discovered more than 100 abandoned containers in the port of Colombo. They contained clinical waste, potentially including human remains, and were leaking fluids. The risk that the containers had contaminated the ground and surface water in the two years they had lay in port unnoticed fuelled public health concerns. Sri Lanka has been able to investigate this problem â but it is likely that, in many cases, abandonment goes undiscovered.  Prevention  The abandonment of dangerous containers in ports is not a new problem. Since the 2000s there have been significant efforts to increase security levels in ports through surveillance, training and safety protocols. In light of the continuing abandonment problem, we know that these measures â and their implementation â are insufficient.  First, we have to start seeing the smuggling of waste and the abandoning of ships and containers as major offences. They should be seen as important parts of the blue crime and maritime security agenda. Appropriate legislation is needed to criminalise them. An international database for such crimes is required, as is transnational cooperation to address them.  Second, corruption in ports plays a key part in ensuring that abandonment goes unnoticed. It needs to be addressed with a concerted international effort.  Finally, increased efforts in building the capacity of ports to deal with hazardous waste, to detect smuggling and to deal with abandonment cases are needed. In particular, this will be necessary for ports which have limited resources and are common destinations for abandoned containers, such as ports in Asia and Africa.  The UN Office on Drugs and Crime, the International Maritime Organization and the European Union already conduct port security capacity building work, in particular in Africa. More of this kind of work is needed.  Beirut has shown us the kind of impact a port disaster can have on a city and its inhabitants. Lessons must be learned to make sure a tragedy like this does not happen again.",https://theconversation.com/beirut-explosion-the-disaster-was-exceptional-but-events-leading-up-to-it-were-not-researchers-144011,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,099337db4e4317956dd17b0663fb60b48b45db1a97b6548c12a87bc3d3eae9e9,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:33.412257,2020-08-05T15:17:46Z,Coronavirus is pushing people into poverty â but temporary basic income can stop this,"The rapid spread of COVID-19 across developing countries has led to a devastating loss of life and livelihoods. The pandemic is having both immediate economic effects and long-lasting consequences on development. This is because developing economies are less able to handle shocks than advanced ones.  Around 80% of workers in developing countries are engaged in tasks that are unlikely to be performed from home, meaning lockdowns are preventing them from working. And 70% of workers make a living in informal markets, with the majority not being covered by any form of social protection. COVID-19 containment measures are leaving a large number of people without any income.  Global poverty has fallen over the past three decades, but many of those lifted out of it have remained vulnerable. They sit just above the poverty line, but are ineligible for existing anti-poverty cash assistance. In a previous article, my co-authors and I argued that this could lead to an increase in global poverty for the first time since the 1990s, with tens of millions falling back below the poverty line. Such a situation, I believe, calls for drastic action.  Extraordinary measures  In a recent working paper for the United Nations Development Programme, my co-author George Gray Molina and I argue that unconditional emergency assistance â what we call temporary basic income (TBI) â is an urgent, fair and feasible way of stopping people falling into poverty or further impoverishment as a result of the pandemic.  Looking at pre-crisis data that covers 97% of the developing worldâs population, weâve estimated what the cost would be of providing TBI to all people currently either below the poverty line or vulnerable to falling under it. This equates to 2.78 billion people across the worldâs 132 developing countries.  EPA-EFE  We investigated three ways of delivering TBI:  Top-ups on existing incomes among poor and near-poor people, up to a minimum level that is at least 70% above the poverty line in that region of the world. Lump sum transfers equivalent to half the income enjoyed by the typical citizen. Lump sum transfers that are uniform regardless of the country where people live. Under this system, the amount we simulated was US$5.50 (Â£4.30) a day per person, which is the typical level of the poverty line among upper middle-income countries.  Which option is best will depend on the situation. For instance, the first will only work in countries where registry systems have accurate information on what people earn. In countries where such systems are absent or weak, flat amounts according to general living standards (as in option two) or poverty lines (option three) might be better.  The total cost amounts to between US$200 billion and US$465 billion per month, depending on the policy choice. This is equivalent to between 0.27% and 0.63% of developing countriesâ combined monthly GDP.  Itâs a relatively moderate cost to cover such a profound shock and protect people from poverty. And providing TBI could have other positive effects as well: unconditional cash transfers can lead to people spending more money on their diet and can potentially improve health outcomes and school attendance. They can also protect peopleâs assets and allow them to diversify their livelihoods.  Will we actually see this happen?  TBI isnât a radical idea. Forms of basic income are being rolled out under different names and with different funding levels around the world. Tuvalu has a fully fledged temporary universal basic income, and Spain has brought forward a minimum income scheme for low-earning households in response to the pandemic.  But our proposed scheme would be much larger â and would aim to reach as many excluded people as possible within the next six to 12 months. There are at least three obstacles to this.  The first one is administrative. Reaching eligible people who are currently invisible to official records and payment systems will require some work â they will need to be digitally registered before they can receive any assistance. Some people are beyond the traditional reach of the state because they lack formal documentation or live in informal settlements, which are more common in developing countries.  In these cases, alternative solutions â such as partnering with local social networks that have greater proximity to poor and vulnerable people â may be needed to find everyone eligible. The cost of adding each new person is not insignificant, but pales in comparison to the direct and indirect benefits of providing those people with TBI.  EPA-EFE  The second obstacle is obvious: funding. Given the temporary nature of the challenge, funding TBI by additional taxation could be politically difficult. Other ways of covering the costs are instead worth exploring.  For example, funds could be raised by repurposing nonessential spending, including wasteful expenditures and energy subsidies (which usually tend to benefit the better off). Alternatively, debt repayments could be paused for a period. Developing countries are expected to make debt payments of US$3.1 trillion this year. A comprehensive repayment freeze for 12 months, if possible, would fund 16 months of TBI under the top-up option, 12 months under option two and up to six months under option three. Also, as emergency cash transfers are often steered towards immediate essential consumption, part of the money will be recaptured by indirect taxation such as VAT and sales taxes, thus providing a degree of self-funding.  The third obstacle is trust. Governments will need to be trusted not to redirect whatever they raise towards other purposes, nor to allow temporary measures to last any longer than agreed. They will need broad (possibly cross-party) support to launch these schemes, and they will need to make sure that those that donât benefit from them still see the schemes as credible. These are all political challenges that need to be addressed on a country-by-country basis.  TBI schemes are not expected to reverse country-wide economic downturns, nor substitute for comprehensive social protection systems. They can, however, mitigate the worst immediate effects of a crisis that has been magnified by deep-rooted structural inequalities and injustices that havenât been decisively addressed in the past.",https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-is-pushing-people-into-poverty-but-temporary-basic-income-can-stop-this-143545,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,0098127ec48c81aa3ab7c80bdf8782d5e5014fc4d37e34dd75740b3b4e320558,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:33.576104,2020-08-05T14:52:10Z,Britainâs public toilet shame: time for equal access to decent facilities for all,"As lockdown began to be relaxed in England from mid-May and people started venturing out for the first time since March, crowds flocked to parks, beaches and other beauty spots to take exercise, enjoy the outdoors and reunite with friends and family. While the taste of freedom may have been sweet, the smell often wasnât.  At the time, with most public toilets still closed, queues around the block for those that had opened and other options out of use (in shopping centres, cafes and pubs), people who were âcaught shortâ turned to the only places on offer. Parks, bushes and residential streets were left with smelly deposits from the general public.  Our work, which explores sustainable ways of managing human waste, points to an important topic for reflection post lockdown: the inadequate provision of safe, clean public toilets in the UK that are fit for purpose.  Most non-disabled people from affluent countries donât often need to plan their day around toilets: itâs a case of âflush and forgetâ. Lack of toilet access is more frequently associated with low and middle-income countries (LMICs), where an estimated two billion people still lack access to safely managed toilets, leading to deaths from diarrhoea and other sanitation-related diseases such as cholera, typhoid and polio. But inadequate toilet access has long been a feature of life for many people in the UK, too.  Toilet inequity in the UK  Long before the COVID-19 crisis, disabled people and those with gastrointestinal disorders such as Crohnâs disease and colitis, have been forced to navigate toilets that are inaccessible, restricted and policed. This impedes their participation in everyday activities that non-disabled people take for granted.  The pandemic has amplified this problem. Sanitation is more than just a means of disposing of bodily waste â it facilitates participation in society. Accessible toilets mean citizenship, dignity and belonging.  Apart from ableism, other important discriminatory dimensions are sex and gender. Womenâs toilets are frequently undersized compared to menâs â despite menstruation, pregnancy and caring responsibilities for small children which all necessitate more frequent and longer bathroom use. This design flaw is a standard that has existed for decades and has only recently been reviewed.  While secrecy around menstruation is often highlighted in other societies, it is easy to overlook the culture of silence around periods in the UK, which compounds inadequate provision of facilities for women and menstruating people. Public toilets can also be uncomfortable or even hostile environments for trans and non-binary people â particularly when gender-neutral facilities arenât available.  This sort of discrimination is compounded by the reduction of public toilet provision over the past decade, and can result in the digestive system and periods becoming a âleashâ, preventing some people from venturing far in case there is no access to a toilet.  Cleaning and maintenance of toilets is vital. But sanitation workers and cleaners remain largely unrecognised and undervalued, even though their public health contribution should arguably receive similar appreciation to that of porters and cleaners in hospitals. Instead of being protected, toilet cleaners â among other typically low-paid but essential workers â are more at risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19.  This highlights another humbling truth for the UK: discriminatory treatment of sanitation workers is not an issue reserved only for LMICs, but occurs within our society too.  A better future  Easing of lockdown has prompted urgent discussion about how to reopen public toilets safely. Innovations such as foot-operated flush pedals, one-way systems and sensors for water, soap, paper towels and bins reduce shared touchpoints and proximity. But this is a timely opportunity to consider how equitable and suitable provision for women, trans and non-binary people, and the needs of disabled people can be addressed. The economic and societal benefits of adequate public toilets have never been clearer.  The crisis also highlights the importance of responsible attitudes towards the collective good. Many actions can be taken by individuals to reduce asymptomatic spread, from wearing a mask to diligent handwashing and closing the toilet lid after use.  As bars, pubs, and other places reopen, a sense of personal responsibility towards societal health, and respect for sanitation workers who facilitate it, will be more important than ever.  Toilets function as a bridge between public and private spaces, signifying who should and shouldnât be present. They stand as political symbols of power and inclusion. With COVID-19 reshaping how we move and interact in public spaces, it is time to recognise the importance of public toilets â and the people who look after them â to equitable, dignified and healthy participation in public life. Now more than ever, we must appreciate that natureâs call can only be put on hold for so long.",https://theconversation.com/britains-public-toilet-shame-time-for-equal-access-to-decent-facilities-for-all-143218,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,b6812f11a12b3109cae0a1a817620a14f561491e6996f4b73aef3cc34f10b003,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

But for a lot of people what has kept them going has been their daily exercise.  Whether itâs a bike ride, a run around the park or a daily walk, many have seen lockdown as an opportunity to get active. And the explosion of TikTok, Zoom, Houseparty and other online platforms has also meant many of us have had easy access to a wide variety of exercise classes.  In a sense this is something that has also been encouraged by the government. Indeed, at the start of lockdown restrictions in the UK, Boris Johnsonâs Conservative government constantly emphasised the importance of âdaily exerciseâ â described as âone journey outside for up to one hourâ.  Given that research has shown that men and boys are more likely, across all age groups, to participate in physical activity, our recent online survey aimed to discover how girls and young women, aged between ten and 20 years of age, have been keeping active during this time. We discovered that 40% of the 509 girls surveyed had increased their levels of physical activity during lockdown.  This is why we are now calling on the government to reinstate coherent messaging about the importance of daily exercise, rather than simply suggesting people should lose weight.  âIt keeps me saneâ  Many girls in our survey said they have taken up new activities â such as walking, running, cycling and online social media workouts â since the start of lockdown. And we found that the 40% of girls who had increased their physical activity tended to be the least active before the COVID-19 restrictions were imposed.  Engaging with physical activity during lockdown was commonly associated with positive mental health benefits, as the girls in the survey highlighted. One 16 year-old told us how:  The results of my daily exercise are becoming apparent now, which is positive for meâ¦ I feel better about my body.  Meanwhile an 18 year-old said:  Being active gives me a chance to clear my head and relieves some of my anxiety.  The girls shared the sentiment that exercise was helping them through this difficult time, as one 15 year-old explained:  My daily exercise is an opportunity to leave my house for an hour â¦ forget the harsh reality of the world. It definitely makes me happy and is keeping me sane.  These girls have experienced, some for the first time, the benefits of being active. And this experience has the potential to be transformative in terms of how these girls relate to their bodiesâ.  Less active girls will have previously received health messages from school, parents and social media about the importance of staying active, but itâs only now they have lived a more active life, that the benefits of exercise is understood.  âEndorsed activityâ  As the experiences of the girls in our study show, lockdown has offered positive benefits for many in terms of being outdoors, active, and healthy. Indeed, a recent survey by the charity Women in Sport, has also shown that government messaging was a key factor for adult women becoming more active during lockdown.  This is why weâve written an open letter to Matt Hancock, the secretary of state for health and social care, calling on the government to reintroduce coherent messaging about the importance of daily exercise.  This is important, because for the girls that took part in our survey, the governmentâs messaging about daily exercise was explicitly listed as a motivational reason for their increased physical activity, as this 18 year-old explained:  The governmentâs rules encourage me to complete an hour of exercise each day. I love being active as it makes lockdown a bit easier.  This was echoed by many of the girls in our survey, including this 16 year-old:  The fact that the government said we could exercise once a day actually encouraged me to exerciseâ¦ [the government] made me feel that I should exercise because they restricted so much activity but left [exercise] available which made me realise how important it was.  Lasting impact  The health benefits of being active are, of course, well known. It can lead to weight loss, lower blood pressure, improved metabolism and better heart health. Physical activity can also reduce anxiety and depression, increase endorphin release â the happy hormones â and reduce overall stress.  Yet, in the UK, the most recent Sport England Active Lives Survey shows that, despite increasing numbers of people being active, only 63% of adults do 150 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity per week. For children, only 47% are meeting the recommended level of physical activity and 29% are failing to achieve 30 minutes of physical activity a day.  Despite successful initiatives such as This Girl Can, it seems women are more difficult to convince of the importance of being active than men.  But as the result of our survey show, lockdown has, for many girls and women, been an opportunity to take up daily exercise. And this is something that must be encouraged long after lockdown restrictions are lifted.",https://theconversation.com/daily-exercise-rules-got-people-moving-during-lockdown-heres-what-the-government-needs-to-do-next-143773,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,f5c4df1e5051ed0e6c5038d51b8e8402f7f43aea3ccfc344cf461b04ffc151e2,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Land-based wind turbines now produce the cheapest type of energy â and there is no doubt wind farms can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing the fossil fuels that have traditionally been used to generate electricity.  But what of wind turbines built on top of sensitive, natural environments â does low-carbon energy still help reduce emissions if it involves disturbing the kinds of habitats that are effective at trapping carbon and keeping it out of the atmosphere? This is an important question, but it is one that is too rarely being asked.  In our recent study, we found that wind farms in Spain are being built on rare peat bogs that store vast quantities of planet-warming carbon. Because these habitats are so poorly mapped, thereâs a good chance that this mistake is being replicated in many other places throughout Europe, including the UK.  Europeâs unmapped peatlands in peril  Peatlands are a natural carbon sink and, despite covering less than 3% of the Earthâs land surface, they contain 20% of all the carbon stored in soils worldwide.  Because some peatlands arenât mapped, they have often been ignored, despite their important role in slowing climate change. Blanket bogs are a rare and unique type of peatland that cover entire landscapes with a distinctive vegetation, often composed of cotton grass, heather, and Sphagnum mosses, which is a particularly effective species for locking up carbon.  Chico & Clough , Author provided  In the UK and Ireland, blanket bogs cover great expanses and are a key part of the landscape in Flow Country, a region of the north of Scotland, and in the north and south Pennines in England. In France or Spain, this habitat is rare, but our research uncovered 14 unrecorded and unprotected blanket bogs in northern Spain that represent the southernmost edge of this habitatâs range in Europe.  Read more: Bogs are unique records of history â here's why  Peatlands â and in particular blanket bogs â face a number of pressures across Europe. Overgrazing, drainage to plant crops and commercial forest, burning to improve grazing and support field sports and, more recently, wind farm developments, can change the natural function of peatlands so that they switch from slowing climate change as carbon sinks, to become carbon sources that leach greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.  Although peat is naturally eroded by wind, rain and ice, blanket bogs grazed by livestock can lose four to six times more carbon than protected bogs. But the most serious risk to these habitats today is wind farms. Unprotected blanket bogs often cover mountain peaks, where there is also great potential for generating wind energy. During wind farm construction, vegetation that helps to trap the carbon is removed to create turbine bases and vehicle access tracks. These tracks create artificial streams that drain the peat and reshape the terrain.  Chico & Clough , Author provided  Recent research has shown that the drainage caused by building and maintaining wind turbines can affect the whole peatland, not just the area next to the farm and its tracks. In our research, we encountered a track that divided the largest unrecognised blanket bog we found in the Cantabrian Mountains into two separate peatlands. The rupture is draining the bog and likely releasing carbon as the peat dries and breaks down.  This release can be so significant that the climate benefit of generating clean energy is likely to be neutralised. For bogs on the southernmost edge of their range in Europe, wind farm construction could mean the total destruction of this habitat and the loss of a natural way of fighting climate change.  In spite of their current degraded state, restoring and protecting blanket bogs could reverse the situation and restore the capability of these habitats as climate allies.  Chico & Clough , Author provided  We need to map all currently undiscovered peatlands and protect them under the EUâs Habitats Directive. Restoring degraded peatlands and reducing human pressures on them could help them recover their natural abilities for storing carbon. In the UK, the research partnership Moors for the Future is attempting to restore substantial areas of degraded blanket bog by covering areas of bare peat with vegetation such as Sphagnum mosses and blocking streams to reduce drainage.  Wind farms are a great way to generate clean energy, but where they are built needs careful consideration. It is perhaps ironic that one of our best man-made tools for fighting climate change can become one of our most unhelpful if it interferes with another natural solution to the problem.",https://theconversation.com/wind-farms-built-on-carbon-rich-peat-bogs-lose-their-ability-to-fight-climate-change-143551,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,1043588c47ef8f8c52a70e5b3c361aa736a6e0235944aa9b025ffd08b8f681bd,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:34.075303,2020-08-05T11:41:44Z,How cities are taking centre stage as characters in novels,"Cityscapes have long played an important role in literature. They serve as backdrops for writers looking to explore themes of isolation, destitution, crime and excitement.  In Stephen Craneâs 1893 novel Maggie: A Girl of the Streets, New York City is a constant presence in a familyâs struggle with poverty, alcoholism, and a young girlâs fall from grace. Michael Ondaatjeâs 1987 In the Skin of a Lion, set in 1930s Toronto, uses the cityâs past to expose the controversial history surrounding its construction and the involvement of the migrant population.  While the city is set to remain an important part of fiction, its role is starting to change. Cities are being brought to the forefront as characters in their own right. This use of cities in fiction is an area I am investigating in my PhD research, which explores the use of space in the novels of Japanese author Haruki Murakami.  Giving life to the city  Primarily, the change from the city as a setting to a character is done in one of two ways. The first is to take a posthumanist approach, which gives a kind of artificial life to a city through a combination of technology and machines. The second is a more organic method, which portrays the city as a lifeform able to feel, breathe â and like all organic life, able to die.  Benjamin Oliverâs 2020 debut novel The Loop is an example of the posthumanist approach. It features a technologically enhanced society completely dependent on the city: a sentient creation of machinery and computers.  NK Jemisinâs 2020 novel The City We Became takes a more organic approach in its establishment of the city as a character. In this case, the novelâs cities are alive. They are organisms able to grow, mature, sicken and die. The hum of traffic and the noise of construction is the cityâs heartbeat and the sewers its digestive system.  Living Tokyo  Haruki Murakami combines the organic with the posthuman in his 2004 novel After Dark.  The narrator is a machine â a CCTV-style camera, able to move seemingly unhindered throughout the city. The narrator does not reflect on itself but does convey strong feelings as it depicts the events of the novel, leaving us to assume it is some form of artificial intelligence.  The novel, however, begins with this artificial narrator describing the city as akin to an organism: a combination of intertwining organisms connected by numerous arteries which âstretch to the ends of its elusive body, circulating a continuous supply of fresh blood cellsâ.  The city is a character in its own right. It is a living, breathing entity that sleeps, seemingly unaware of the events and spaces that the protagonist, a young woman named Mari, stumbles into.  After Dark is a story of two sisters who have grown apart. The novel takes place after the last train has left Tokyo, leaving all those remaining in the city trapped until morning. Mari, like many Murakami characters, is unable to find solace at home. Her sister, Eri â a beautiful and popular girl â has withdrawn from society and entered into a state of seemingly unending sleep. Insecurity and guilt over her sisterâs current state drives Mari from her family home and into the city.  Despite Mariâs desire to remain an invisible customer of an all-night Dennyâs restaurant, she is swept up in the stories of characters who belong to the night. These characters are the embodiment of the city. They are an essential part of its lifeforce, and they are all connected. Each character has âa different face and mind, and at the same time each is a nameless part of the collective entityâ.  A mirror to humanity  Murakamiâs city is a reflection of his characters. On the surface, the city is a combination of seemingly dark and dangerous places. Yet within its walls are pockets of safety, comfort and human connection. Murakami uses the city to tell the story of those characters who frequent the streets after dark.  Writers like Murakami feel a responsibility to reflect important aspects of society in their fiction â and this is what we are seeing with the changes to the ways writers portray and use fictional cities.  We care about our carbon footprint and about the air our children breathe. So we nurture our cities. We add green spaces, we recycle, walk, cycle, use public transportation. We are proud of our cities and we think of them as a part of our identity. They are an important part of the way we live and we have come to depend on them.  It is no wonder writers are starting to see the city as a living entity. They are bringing the cities to the forefront of fiction and breathing life into them.",https://theconversation.com/how-cities-are-taking-centre-stage-as-characters-in-novels-142688,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,af2cab8c3f34e73b1a9ee238befd6be9c202a90dc08f6bcd36d2ad04de141d15,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

But it doesnât mean that telling a patient something simple, such as âthis drug will make you feel betterâ, will have an effect. Itâs more complicated than that, as our latest research shows.  Positive messages are usually repeated, definite, specific and personal. They should also be communicated by an authority figure who shows empathy (see graphic below). While our study does not identify what the most effective components of a positive message are (the sample was too small), the results imply that, for example, a positive message that is not specific or personalised, and is delivered by a doctor perceived to lack authority and empathy, will not have the desired effect.  Jeremy Howick , Author provided (No reuse)  What does all this mean for digitally assisted consultations ranging from telephone appointments to âcarebotsâ (artificially intelligent robots delivering healthcare)? This is an important question to answer since carebots are being proposed as a cost-effective way to deal with the need to keep up with care for the increasing elderly populations in the UK and elsewhere.  The pandemic has accelerated the use of digitally assisted consultations, with the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, claiming that patients wonât want to go back to face-to-face consultations after the pandemic. Online consultations are different from carebot consultations, but the trend away from human-to-human interaction canât be denied. They have also both been rolled out too fast for ethical frameworks to be developed.  Technical and ethical problems  Adopting the evidence that positive messages help patients in the digital age is both technically and ethically problematic. While some of the components of a positive message (âthis drug will make you feel better soonâ) can be straightforwardly delivered through a mobile phone, via a video call, or even by a carebot, it seems to be inherently problematic for others. For example, the feeling that someone has authority might come from their title (doctor), which is presumably the same whether the doctor is seen in person or over the telephone.  But studies show authority also comes from body language. Itâs more difficult to display body language through a telephone or video. While carebots may be able to convey their authority â and they have been shown to display sufficiently sophisticated body language to evoke certain emotions â real humans move differently. Adapting what we know about authoritative messages for the digital age is not straightforward. Some studies reveal that while digitally assisted consultations do not seem to be harmful, they are different (usually shorter), and we donât know if they are as effective.  Also, to make the positive message personal to a patient (another component of positive messages) it might be important to pick up on subtle cues such as a downward glance or awkward pause, which studies have shown can be important for making accurate diagnoses. These cues may be more difficult to read through a telephone call, let alone by a carebot â at least for now.  These are not just technical problems, they are ethical too. If digitally assisted healthcare consultations are not as effective at delivering positive messages, which, in turn, result in better care, then they threaten to violate the ethical requirement to help patients. Of course, if a carebot can do things more cheaply or to more people (they might not need to sleep), it might balance things out. But weighing the different ethical issues needs to be evaluated carefully, and this has not been done.  For carebots, this raises other ethical and even existential issues. If being empathic and caring is a key component of an effectively delivered positive message, it is important to know whether carebots are capable of caring. While we know that robots can be perceived as caring and empathic, it is not the same thing as being caring. It may not matter to some patients whether empathy is feigned or real as long as they benefit, but again, this needs to be fleshed out rather than assumed. Researchers are aware of these (and other) ethical issues and have called for a framework to regulate the design of carebots.  The study of positive messages shows that the new ethical frameworks would benefit from incorporating the latest evidence about the complexity of effective, positive â and other types of â communication. At the end of such a serious analysis, it may turn out that digitally assisted healthcare consultations and carebots are as good as face-to-face consultations.  They could even be better in some cases (some people may feel more comfortable telling intimate secrets to a robot than to a human). What is certain is that they are different, and we currently do not know what the implications of those differences are for optimising the benefits of complex positive messages in healthcare.",https://theconversation.com/healthcare-consultations-in-the-digital-age-are-carebots-up-to-the-job-143851,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,cfefada59abe9c4fabd9ef14a220b0dedbf5894cf6fbb00e355f9da7faafa49f,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

With each of these events â from the US ban on telecoms company Huawei to the US response to events in Hong Kong and the continuing escalation of the trade war which stretches back formally to 2018 â one has to remember that there are several different conflicts taking place between the worldâs largest and second-largest economies. It is important to work out which of these the TikTok issue belongs to.  Ostensibly, the main reason for a ban is national security concerns. Trump administration officials say TikTok could pose a security threat by giving the Chinese government access to vast amounts of US citizensâ data. Yet there is little evidence for these claims, nor how Trumpâs proposed solution of selling TikTokâs US operations to Microsoft would solve the problem.  Similar issues were raised by the ban on Huawei, and the operations of other major Chinese corporates in the US. They even predate the Trump presidency, reaching back to the mid-2000s when Congress vetoed Chinese involvement in energy company Unocal, and raised questions about tech company Lenovoâs purchase of the US IBM ThinkPad brand.  A strange security risk  TikTok seems to pose a strange kind of security challenge, given that most of its content is silly viral video memes. With Huawei there were more complex matters to verify, such as how to check the reliability of its hardware. TikTok doesnât involve these to such an extent. So why the focus on this company?  Reaching beyond the realm of security, therefore, we must venture into that of trade and technology. TikTokâs greatest problem is that it manifestly demonstrates Chinese success beyond the borders of China. This is not as common as it might seem. Chinese companies which are genuinely internationally successful are few and far between.  In 2020, the app has enjoyed remarkable success, with a staggering 2 billion downloads globally. The US recorded 165 million downloads â the third highest country after India and China â and the app is rapidly rising up the ranks of the most-downloaded app league tables.  It may well be that an achievement like this, at a time like this, is the companyâs biggest crime. So moving against TikTok on security grounds may well be an excuse to distract from the reason it is most problematic for the White House, the fact that a Chinese company can succeed so well in the US. The optics of that are very negative for the Trump administration.  Optics  That brings us to the third area of conflict â the many calculations and machinations around the imminent presidential election in November. For Trump â criticised for his response to the COVID-19 pandemic domestically and facing very poor economic figures â one area where he can, and is, trying to appeal to voters is by taking a tough line on China. TikTok offers a relatively easy target by which to show his prowess.  With the trade talks between Washington and Beijing largely halted, this area is one he can demonstrate activism and make a show of strength. Here he can try and build a narrative of the man people can trust to be tough on China while highlighting the perceived faults of his opponent, Joe Biden, who he will paint as being tarred by the Obama administrationâs policy of engagement with China.  Ultimately, the boundary between legitimate security concerns, political calculations that only have domestic issues at their heart, and good old-fashioned protectionism is a very faint one. With TikTok, the sense of deliberately distorting and manipulating facts to suit an agenda, rather than devising an agenda to respond to facts, is palpable â as it is in so many other areas of the Trump presidency.  But we must be clear. The evidence strongly suggests that TikTok is an issue because the US â particularly at the moment, and particularly under Trump â cannot countenance Chinese commercial and technological success without searching for security or competition grounds to combat it.  The great pity about this approach is that it means the genuine issues and concerns get diluted to the point that they are missed. China presents many problems in the area of security â nobody denies that. People watching brief, often mindless videos, though, isnât one of them.",https://theconversation.com/how-tiktok-got-caught-in-the-crosshairs-of-us-china-politics-143953,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,81ec0686a31524fd8026fed6a25ebf2472b3dc612666e0983420de9383e4c71b,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:36.797978,2020-08-05T10:59:21Z,Knife crime: why young people need to get a say in their rehabilitation,"Knife crime hit a record high in England and Wales before the COVID-19 lockdown came into place â with police reporting 46,265 cases for the year to March. The recent report by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said this was 51% higher compared to when the data was first collected in 2011.  During lockdown, knife and gun crime dropped considerably, but these figures have now begun to increase with restrictions easing.  Tougher sentences are often touted as the answer to knife crime. There also seems to be the belief that people who carry out such crimes have forfeited their right to political and public empathy.  The idea that young people should get a say in their punishment then, might also seem far fetched to some. But every young person has a right to be meaningfully involved in their own rehabilitation. And giving them a say on how the process works and how itâs carried out is crucial. Not least because it can help to reduce the likelihood they will carry or use a knife as a weapon.  Current situation  As it stands, youth offending teams work with young people involved in, or on the cusp of, knife-related crime, often ordered by the courts. These teams do in-depth assessments to flag up whatâs triggering young peopleâs involvement in knife crime. And theyâll also look at issues like the impact of childhood trauma on thinking and behaviour.  These teams aim to work in a collaborative way with young people to help them change their behaviour. In theory, this would see young people taking on responsibility for their learning and making decisions on what topics to cover, or acting as spokesperson for the group in feedback forums with their youth offending teams. But in reality, many young people donât really engage or involve themselves with the process of rehabilitation. They just see is as âsomething to get throughâ â as recent research shows.  The study, which involved 15 months of fieldwork between 2016-2017 with a youth offending team in England, looked at the extent of young peopleâs participation in the rehabilitation process.  It found that some of the young people simply aimed to attend meetings, putting as little as possible into the process. They were seemingly compliant and responsive to demands with little resistance but were actually just going through the motions.  âGame playingâ  One support worker described how some young people seemed insincere â giving a false impression they were content with their specified objectives set by the youth offending team â requiring them to complete worksheets or anger management courses.  Another support worker in the study, Mason, queried whether staff should be digging beneath the surface â especially with young people who appear quietly compliant.  He explained how he felt concerned the âgame playing elementâ of the system discouraged young people from properly engaging in supervision meetings:  Do you see that strategising â is that what we count as good? Or are the ones who chafe against thisâ¦is that actually more meaningful? [Is] their participation, more meaningful?  Jackson, one of the youth offending team managers, explained how a lot of young people just want to complete whatâs required of them without any complications:  They see it as a punishment. They see us as part of theâ¦well, and we are, the officers of the court. And a voice of authority. And they wanna get through it for six months, for nine months, for twelve months. They donât think of participation in a way that, you knowâ¦that a practitioner might.  Indeed, across the study, young people under youth justice supervision generally didnât want to question those in authority because of fears this could lead to a delay in completing their court order.  The study also revealed that many young people felt decisions about their rehabilitation were largely outside their control â as Tommy explains:  I donât think itâs up to me to say that, is it? I donât thinkâ¦I get a say in what the [youth offending team], do I?.  A collaborative approach  Ultimately, young peopleâs voices must not be ignored in this process â they have a right to a say about their rehabilitation. But young people need more reassurances to know they are entitled to express their views and that their perspectives will be taken seriously â and not used against them.  Many of the staff in the youth offending team recognised that empathy and trust plays a pivotal role in bolstering young peopleâs participation. And research showing the transformative power of mutually respectful relationships backs this up.  To stop young people feeling disaffected then, they need to be consistently more involved in the decision making process surrounding their rehabilitation.  This will not only help to pave the way for greater levels of engagement, but it will also help to maximise young peopleâs potential for success â and hopefully reduce the likelihood of them picking up a weapon in the future.",https://theconversation.com/knife-crime-why-young-people-need-to-get-a-say-in-their-rehabilitation-142779,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,ae07961d9b4922fd84afa5319b4d9e7d76c24cf0ae5bb01a490d1ae00862c15f,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:38.055119,2020-08-05T10:56:55Z,What makes a state a state? Why places like Kosovo live in limbo,"If we look at a map, the world appears neatly organised into a patchwork of states. They are clearly named and have clear borders. Yet, a closer looks reveals a much more complicated picture. Across the globe, groups are in various stages of claiming and gaining independence and recognition. As recent controversy surrounding Palestineâs place in Google and Apple navigation tools shows, the map is far from finished.  Take Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008 having separated from Serbia following a devastating war in the late 1990s and the dissolution of Yugoslavia. More than 20 years after the war â and a decade since the declaration â Kosovoâs statehood continues to divide politicians and the public alike. Recently, Dua Lipa, the famous singer born in London to parents who left Kosovo during the 1990s, sparked controversy when she tweeted a map of âgreater Albaniaâ that included Kosovo.  Separating from another sovereign is the default way in which states are born. This is what the independence movement in Scotland seeks to do. It is also how the United States became independent in 1776 and, according to their declaration, âabsolved from all Allegiance to the British Crownâ. The pacific island of Bougainville last year voted in favour of separation from Papua New Guinea paving the way to what is predicted to be a long road towards independence.  While managing to claim control of a territory and its people from a previous sovereign is important, being internationally recognised as the sovereign of that area is also crucial for functioning like other states.  The value of recognition becomes apparent when we look at the way in which the status of states is often based on their participation in internationally recognised families of states, such as the United Nations. South Sudan, which declared independence in 2011, is seen by many as the youngest state in the world, because it is the most recent state accepted into the UN. Other declarations of independence since then, such as that of Donetsk and Lugansk in Eastern Ukraine in 2014 or Catalonia in 2017 have been ignored internationally and so are not considered to have resulted in new states.  But not everything is black and white. Unlike what many might think, Kosovoâs declaration of independence in 2008 is not recognised by almost half of the UNâs members. Crucially, these countries include China and Russia, which are on the UN Security Council and can effectively veto any membership. And yet, Kosovo is a member of the World Bank, the IMF, UEFA and FIFA. It also made a joyous debut at the Rio Olympics. For years â and in order to boost its statehood credentials â Kosovo has been trying to join the Eurovision song contest, but it is blocked by Serbia, which is already a member of the European Broadcasting Union â the organiser of the event.  Kosovo is not the only state that seems in a state of limbo. Palestine is also only an observer to the UN, despite being recognised by the majority of the members, as well as being part of other international organisations such as the Arab League. Taiwan is not fully recognised, despite being one of the worldâs leading economies. This lack of recognition often creates important problems. For example, the fact that Taiwan is not a member of the World Health Organisation because of its lack of recognition meant that the island was not able share with others potentially valuable knowledge at the early stages of the pandemic.  EPA  Kosovo has also had to face a recent trend of states withdrawing their recognition, following an orchestrated effort by Serbia which still refuses to recognise its former province as an independent state. There was a brief diplomatic crisis when the Czech president, Milos Zeman, suggested that his country might do the same. Serbia has also successfully lobbied against Kosovoâs membership of UNESCO and Interpol.  This tactic is being used by several states that see independence movements as undermining their sovereignty. China has used its diplomatic clout to convince states tode-recognise Taiwan. Morocco makes trade deals with other states on the condition they de-recognise the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in Western Sahara, which Morocco considers as part of its territory.  This trend of de-recognition illustrates very well that what we think of as sovereignty is neither static nor absolute. People in places such as Palestine are halfway to having control of their territories. Some, like Kosovo, have one foot in the international system and one foot out. But, at the same time, independence struggles â such as those in Scotland or Bougainville â or competitions over who has more recognition â like those between Kosovo and Serbia or Taiwan and China â show that sovereignty, a buzzword for politicians, continues to be a prize worth fighting for. It is what defines our world of states and who gets to be a member of it.",https://theconversation.com/what-makes-a-state-a-state-why-places-like-kosovo-live-in-limbo-132403,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,9268392eb28d7a3b770d927da039241f6497d7d59629212295e8cbe6314f6ecc,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:38.282541,2020-08-05T09:51:42Z,Is humanity doomed because we canât plan for the long term? Three experts discuss,"While the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic are still unclear, it is certain that they are a profound shock to the systems underpinning contemporary life.  The World Bank estimates that global growth will contract by between 5% and 8% globally in 2020, and that COVID-19 will push between 71-100 million into extreme poverty. Sub-Saharan Africa is expected to be hit hardest. In developed countries health, leisure, commercial, educational and work practices are being reorganised â some say for good â in order to facilitate the forms of social distancing being advocated by experts and (sometimes reluctantly) promoted by governments.  Each of us has been affected by the changes wrought by COVID-19 in different ways. For some, the period of isolation has afforded time for contemplation. How do the ways in which our societies are currently structured enable crises such as this? How might we organise them otherwise? How might we use this opportunity to address other pressing global challenges, such climate change or racism?  For others, including those deemed vulnerable or âessential workersâ, such reflections may have instead been directly precipitated from a more visceral sense of their exposure to danger. Had adequate preparations been made for events such as COVID-19? Were lessons being learnt not only to manage crises such as these when they happen again, but to prevent them from happening in the first place? Is the goal of getting back to normality adequate, or should we instead be seeking to refashion normality itself?  Such profound questions are commonly prompted by major events. When our sense of normality is shattered, when our habits get disrupted, we are made more aware that the world could be otherwise. But are humans capable of enacting such lofty plans? Are we capable of planning for the long-term in a meaningful way? What barriers might exist and, perhaps more pressingly, how might we overcome them in order to create a better world?  This article is part of Conversation Insights  The Insights team generates long-form journalism derived from interdisciplinary research. The team is working with academics from different backgrounds who have been engaged in projects aimed at tackling societal and scientific challenges.  As experts from three different academic disciplines whose work considers the capacity to engage in long-term planning for unanticipated events, such as COVID-19, in different ways, our work interrogates such questions. So is humanity in fact able to successfully plan for the longterm future?  Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Oxford, argues that our obsession with short-term planning may be a part of human nature â but possibly a surmountable one. Chris Zebrowski, an emergency governance specialist from Loughborough University, contends that our lack of preparedness, far from being natural, is a consequence of contemporary political and economic systems. Per Olsson, sustainability scientist and expert in sustainability transformations from the Stockholm Resilience Centre at Stockholm University, reflects on how crisis points can be used to change the future â drawing on examples from the past in order to learn how to be more resilient going into the future.  We are built this way  Robin Dunbar  COVID-19 has highlighted three key aspects of human behaviour that seem unrelated but which, in fact, arise from the same underlying psychology. One was the bizarre surge in panic buying and stockpiling of everything from food to toilet rolls. A second was the abject failure of most states to be prepared when experts had been warning governments for years that a pandemic would happen sooner or later. The third has been the exposure of the fragility of globalised supply chains. All three of these are underpinned by the same phenomenon: a strong tendency to prioritise the short term at the expense of the future.  Most animals, including humans, are notoriously bad at taking the long term consequences of their actions into account. Economists know this as the âpublic good dilemmaâ. In conservation biology, it is known as the âpoacherâs dilemmaâ and also also, more colloquially, as âthe tragedy of the commonsâ.  If you are a logger, should you cut down the last tree in the forest, or leave it standing? Everyone knows that if it is left standing, the forest will eventually regrow and the whole village will survive. But the dilemma for the logger is not next year, but whether he and his family will survive until tomorrow. For the logger, the economically rational thing to do is, in fact, to cut the tree down.  This is because the future is unpredictable, but whether or not you make it to tomorrow is absolutely certain. If you die of starvation today, you have no options when it comes to the future; but if you can make through to tomorrow, there is a chance that things might have improved. Economically, itâs a no-brainer. This is, in part, why we have overfishing, deforestation and climate change.  The process underpinning this is known to psychologists as discounting the future. Both animals and humans typically prefer a small reward now to a larger reward later, unless the future reward is very large. The ability to resist this temptation is dependent on the frontal pole (the bit of the brain right just above your eyes), one of whose functions is to allow us to inhibit the temptation to act without thinking of the consequences. It is this small brain region that allows (most of) us to politely leave the last slice of cake on the plate rather than wolf it down. In primates, the bigger this brain region is, the better they are at these kinds of decisions.  Our social life, and the fact that we (and other primates) can manage to live in large, stable, bonded communities depends entirely on this capacity. Primate social groups are implicit social contracts. For these groups to survive in the face of the ecological costs that group living necessarily incur, people must be able to forego some of their selfish desires in the interests of everyone else getting their fair share. If that doesnât happen, the group will very quickly break up and disperse.  In humans, failure to inhibit greedy behaviour quickly leads to excessive inequality of resources or power. This is probably the single most common cause of civil unrest and revolution, from the French Revolution to Hong Kong today.  Miguel Candela/EPA-EFE  The same logic underpins economic globalisation. By switching production elsewhere where production costs are lower, homegrown industries can reduce their costs. The problem is that this occurs at a cost to the community, due to increased social security expenditure to pay for the now redundant employees of home industries until such time as they can find alternative employment. This is a hidden cost: the producer doesnât notice (they can sell more cheaply than they could otherwise have done) and the shopper doesnât notice (they can buy cheaper).  There is a simple issue of scale that feeds into this. Our natural social world is very small scale, barely village size. Once community size gets large, our interests switch from the wider community to a focus on self-interest. Society staggers on, but it becomes an unstable, increasingly fractious body liable at continual risk of fragmenting, as all historical empires have found.  Businesses provide a smaller-scale example of these effects. The average lifetime of companies in the FTSE100 index has declined dramatically in the last half-century: three-quarters have disappeared in just 30 years. The companies that have survived turn out to be those that have a long term vision, are not interested in get-rich-quick strategies to maximise returns to investors and have a vision of social benefit. Those that have gone extinct have largely been those that pursued short term strategies or those that, because of their size, lacked the structural flexibility to adapt (think holiday operator Thomas Cook).  Rob Curran/Unsplash , FAL  Much of the problem, in the end, comes down to scale. Once a community exceeds a certain size, most of its members become strangers: we lose our sense of commitment both to others as individuals and to the communal project that society represents.  COVID-19 may be the reminder many societies need to rethink their political and economic structures into a more localised form which is closer to their constituents. Of course, these will surely need bringing together in federal superstructures, but the key here is a level of autonomous community-level government where the citizen feels they have a personal stake in the way things work.  The power of politics  Chris Zebrowski  Where size and scale is concerned, it doesnât get much bigger than the Rideau canal. Stretching over 202 kilometres in length, the Rideau canal in Canada is regarded as one of the great engineering feats of the 19th century. Opened in 1832, the canal system was designed to act as an alternative supply route to the vital stretch of the St Lawrence river connecting Montreal and the naval base in Kingston.  The impetus for this project was the threat of resumed hostilities with the Americans following a war fought between the United States, the United Kingdom and their allies from 1812-1815. While the canal would never need to be used for its intended purpose (despite its considerable cost), it is just one example of human ingenuity being paired with significant public investment in the face of an uncertain future threat.  âDiscounting the futureâ may well be a common habit. But I donât think that this is an inevitable consequence of how our brains are wired or an enduring legacy of our primate ancestry. Our proclivity to short-termism has been socialised. It is a result of the ways we are socially and politically organised today.  Businesses prioritise short-term profits over longer term outcomes because it appeals to shareholders and lenders. Politicians dismiss long-term projects in favour of quick-fix solutions promising instant results which can feature in campaign literature that is distributed every four years.  At the same time, we are surrounded by examples of highly sophisticated, and often well-financed, tools for risk management. The major public works projects, vital social security systems, sizeable military assemblages, complex financial instruments, and elaborate insurance policies which support our contemporary way of life attest to the human capacity to plan and prepare for the future when we feel compelled to do so.  In recent months, the vital importance of emergency preparedness and response systems in managing the COVID-19 crisis has come into full public view. These are highly complex systems which employ horizon scanning, risk registers, preparedness exercises and a variety of other specialist methods to identify and plan for future emergencies before they happen. Such measures ensure that we are prepared for future events, even when we are not entirely sure when (or if) they will materialise.  While we could not predict the scale of the outbreak of COVID-19, previous coronavirus outbreaks in Asia meant we knew it was a possibility. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been warning about the risks of an international influenza pandemic for many years now. In the UK, the 2016 national preparedness project Exercise Cygnus made abundantly clear that the country lacked the capacity to adequately respond to a large-scale public health emergency. The danger was clearly identified. What was required to prepare for such a calamity was known. What was lacking was the political will to provide adequate investment in these vital systems.  Neil Hall/EPA-EFE  In many western nations the ascendance of neoliberalism (and accompanying logic of austerity) has contributed to the defunding of many critical services, including emergency preparedness, upon which our safety and security depend. This is in sharp contrast to countries including China, New Zealand, South Korea, and Vietnam where a commitment to both preparedness and response has ensured a rapid suppression of the disease and the minimisation of its disruptive potential to lives and the economy.  While such a diagnosis may first appear to be bleak, there is good reason to find within it some hope. If the causes of short-termism are a product of the ways we are organised, then there is an opportunity for us reorganise ourselves to address them.  Recent studies suggest that the public not only recognises the risk of climate change, but are demanding urgent action be taken to stave off this existential crisis. We cannot allow the death and destruction of COVID-19 to have been in vain. In the wake of this tragedy, we must be prepared to radically rethink how we organise ourselves our societies and be prepared to take ambitious actions to ensure the security and sustainability of our species.  Our capacity to deal not only with future pandemics, but larger-scale (and perhaps not unrelated) threats including climate change will require us to exercise the human capacity for foresight and prudence in the face of future threats. It is not beyond us to do so.  How to change the world  Per Olsson  As much as short-termism and structural issues have come to play out in analyses of the pandemic, those focused on the longer term keep arguing that this is the time for change.  The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a slew of people arguing that this is a once-in-a-generation moment for transformation. Government responses, these writers say, must drive far-reaching economic and social change relating to energy and food systems, otherwise we will be vulnerable to more crises in the future. Some go further and claim a different world is possible, a more equitable and sustainable society less obsessed with growth and consumption. But transforming multiple systems simultaneously is not an easy task, and it is worth understanding better what we already know about transformations and crisis.  History shows us that crisis does indeed create a unique chance for change.  A classic example is how the oil crisis in 1973 enabled the transition from a car-based society to a cycling nation in the Netherlands. Prior to the energy crisis there was growing opposition to cars, and a social movement emerged in response to the increasingly congested cities and the number of traffic related deaths, especially children.  Another example is the Black Death, the plague that swept Asia, Africa, and Europe in the 14th century. This led to the abolition of feudalism and the strengthening of peasants rights in Western Europe.  But while positive (large-scale) societal change can come out of crises, the consequences are not always better, more sustainable, or more just, and sometimes the changes that emerge are different from one context to another.  For example, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami affected two of Asiaâs longest-running insurgencies in Sri Lanka and the Aceh province in Indonesia very differently. In the former, the armed conflict between the Sri Lankan government and the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam deepened and intensified by the natural disaster. In Aceh meanwhile, it resulted in a historic peace agreement between the Indonesian government and the separatists.  Some of these differences can be explained by the long histories of the conflicts. But the readiness of different groups to further their agenda, the anatomy of the crisis itself, and the actions and strategies following the initial tsunami event also have important parts to play.  It comes as no surprise, then, that the opportunities for change can be seized by self-interested movements and therefore can accelerate non-democratic tendencies. Power can be further consolidated among groups not interested in improving equity and sustainability. We see this right now in places like the Philippines and Hungary.  John Thys/EPA-EFE  With many clamouring for change, what gets left out of the discussion is that the scale, speed, and quality of transformations matter. And more importantly, the specific capabilities that are needed to navigate such significant change successfully.  There is often a confusion about what kinds of actions actually make a difference and what should be done now, and by whom. The risk is that opportunities created by the crisis are missed and that efforts â with the best of intentions and all the promises of being innovative â just lead back to the pre-crisis status quo, or to a slightly improved one, or even to a radically worse one.  For example, the financial crisis of 2008 was seized on by some as a moment to transform the finance sector, but the strongest forces pushed the system back to something resembling the pre-crash status quo.  Read more: Lessons from the 2008 financial crisis for our coronavirus recovery today â Recovery podcast series part six  Systems that create inequality, insecurity, and unsustainable practices are not easily transformed. Transformation, as the word suggests, requires fundamental changes in multiple dimensions such as power, resource flows, roles, and routines. And these shifts must take place at different levels in society, from practices and behaviours, to rules and regulations, to values and worldviews. This involves changing the relationships among humans but also profoundly change the relationships between humans and nature.  We see efforts now during COVID-19 to â at least in principle â commit to these kinds of changes, with ideas once viewed as radical now being deployed by a range of different groups. In Europe, the idea of a green recovery is growing. The city of Amsterdam is considering implementing doughnut economics â an economic system that is intended to deliver ecological and human wellbeing; and universal basic income is being rolled out in Spain. All existed before the COVID-19 crisis and have been piloted in some cases, but the pandemic has put rocket boosters under the ideas.  Quique Garcis/EPA-EFE  So for those that seek to use this opportunity to create change that will ensure the long-term health, equity, and sustainability of our societies, there are some important considerations. It is critical to dissect the anatomy of the crisis and adjust actions accordingly. Such assessment should include questions about what type of multiple, interacting crises are occurring, what parts of the âstatus quoâ are truly collapsing and what parts remain firmly in place, and who is affected by all of these changes. Another key thing to do is to identify piloted experiments that have reached a certain level of âreadinessâ.  It is also important to deal with inequalities and include marginalised voices to avoid transformation processes becoming dominated and co-opted by a specific set of values and interests. This also means respecting and working with the competing values that will inevitably come into conflict.  How we organise our efforts will define our systems for decades to come. Crises can be opportunities â but only if they are navigated wisely.

2020-08-06 13:22:38.450742,2020-08-04T18:27:19Z,Abandoned fibreglass boats are releasing toxins and microplastics across the world,"Where do old boats go to die? The cynical answer is they are put on eBay for a few pennies in the hope they become some other ignorant dreamerâs problem.  As a marine biologist, I am increasingly aware that the casual disposal of boats made out of fibreglass is harming our coastal marine life. The problem of end-of-life boat management and disposal has gone global, and some island nations are even worried about their already overstretched landfill.  The strength and durability of fibreglass transformed the boating industry and made it possible to mass produce small leisure craft (larger vessels like cruise ships or fishing trawlers need a more solid material like aluminium or steel). However, boats that were built in the fibreglass boom of the 1960s and 1970s are now dying.  We need a drain hole for old boats. We can sink them, bury them, cut them to pieces, grind them or even fill them with compost and make a great welcoming sign, right in the middle of roundabouts in seaside towns.  But there are too many of them and weâre running out of space. To add to the problem, the hurricane season wreaks havoc through the marinas in some parts of the world, with 63,000 boats damaged or destroyed after Irma and Harvey in the Caribbean in 2017 alone.  Most boats currently head to landfill. However, many are also disposed of at sea, usually by simply drilling a hole in the hull and leaving it to sink someplace offshore.  Some say that dumped fibreglass boats will make suitable artificial reefs. However, very little research has been done on at-sea disposal and the worry is that eventually these boats will degrade and move with the currents and harm the coral reefs, ultimately breaking up into microplastics. Recently, scientists have investigated the damage to mangrove, seagrass and coral habitats and although the effects have only been recorded on a relatively localised basis for now, the cumulative effect of abandoned boats may increase exponentially in the coming years.  To take one example, researchers from Plymouth University found high concentrations of copper, zinc and lead in sediment samples and inside the guts of ragworms in two estuaries in eastern England (Orwell and Blackwater). These contaminants greatly exceeded the environmental quality guidelines, and came from peeling paints from boats abandoned nearby.  Since no registration is needed for leisure vessels, the boats are often dumped once the cost of disposal exceeds the resale value, becoming the liability of the unlucky landowner. Human health hazards arise from chemicals or materials used in the boat: rubber, plastic, wood, metal, textiles and of course oil. Moreover, asbestos was employed extensively as an insulator on exhausts and leaded paints were commonly used as a corrosion inhibitor, alongside mercury-based compounds and tributyltin (TBT) as antifouling agents. Although we lack evidence on the human impact of TBT, lead and mercury are recognised as neurotoxins.  Dan_Manila / shutterstock  And then there are the repairs â grinding away at fibreglass boats, often in the open, creates clouds of airborne dust. Workers have not always worn masks and some succumbed to asbestosis-like diseases. Inevitably, some of the dust would find its way back into the water.  The fibreglass is filtered by marine shellfish (in my own research I found up to 7,000 small shards in oysters in Chichester Harbour in southern England) or cling on the shells of tiny water fleas and sink them to the seafloor. The particulate material accumulated in the stomach of shellfish can block their intestinal tracts and eventually lead to death through malnutrition and starvation.  The microparticles stuck on water fleas may have repercussions for swimming and locomotion in general, therefore limiting the ability of the organisms to detect prey, feed, reproduce, and evade predators. There is huge potential for these tiny specks of old boats to accumulate in bigger animals as they are transferred up the food chain.  Those microparticles are the resins holding the fibreglass together and contain phthalates, a massive group of chemicals associated with severe human health impacts from ADHD to breast cancer, obesity and male fertility issues.  Abandoned boats are now a common sight on many estuaries and beaches, leaking heavy metals, microglass and phtalates: we really must start paying attention to the hazard they pose to human health and the threats to local ecology.",https://theconversation.com/abandoned-fibreglass-boats-are-releasing-toxins-and-microplastics-across-the-world-143857,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,78341c7397339f5f3b9b7efc0611d3c23f08aa4da436b29e34cf8c51a54dd62d,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

In the UK, tourism linked to HBOâs Game of Thrones has proved a particular success story. Before the coronavirus pandemic, 350,000 people visited Northern Ireland annually for Game of Thrones-related tourism, spending an estimated Â£50m every year.  Now, the UK tourism industry is looking to recover from the devastating impact of the coronavirus pandemic.  Across the UK, a new industry standard named âWeâre Good to Goâ has been introduced, intended to give visitors confidence that tourism organisations are abiding by government standards. Tourism agency Visit Scotland has launched a marketing campaign to encourage local people back safely, as has Tourism Northern Ireland. Visits to sites beloved by fans could provide a valuable lifeline.  Fan tourism, identity and local economies  The visits taken by fans to these destinations involve an emotional relationship between space, place, memory and identity.  Being a fan of a film or television series allows people to identify as part of a group of fellow fans with the same interests. When they visit important sites, they may feel a sense of connection to other fans in the same place. They may also remember how they felt when watching a favourite film or TV show, and feel a close connection to those sites.  In my research, I have explored how visiting sites seen on-screen allows fans to use their imagination to inhabit fictional worlds that they can never truly visit.  Fan tourism includes visiting locations where films and TV series have been filmed, production studio tours â such as Warner Brothersâ Harry Potter Tour â and film-related theme parks. It also often involves the use of digital media technologies, such as social media, to plan trips and to share experiences with others afterwards.  Visit Britain has recognised the impact of film and TV locations on tourism. Visit England reported that screen tourism contributed between Â£100 million and Â£140 million to the economy in 2014.  This pre-pandemic success can be seen across the UK nations. In Scotland, locations associated with the TV series Outlander, based on a series of books by American author Diana Gabaldon, saw an almost 200% rise in visitors.  Visit Walesâ promotion of sites used in Doctor Who also shows how screen media can inspire tourist activities, as does Tourism NIâs development of activities linked to TV show Derry Girls.  After coronavirus  When faced with disruption and upheaval, we often turn to favourite books or shows to offer comfort and as a coping method. Fans may have re-watched favourite films or television series during lockdown to help deal with their anxieties.  However, they have been unable to visit important locations due to the closure of museums, heritage sites and official media tours. Being able to to finally go back to such places again allows fans to reassert their identities, to stand again in important spaces, and feel a sense of reassurance and security as things begin to get back to normal.  Fan tourists are a particular asset to tourist destinations because of their loyalty to specific locations. They may be more likely to want to return to important places before more general tourists. They may also want to support these sites financially to ensure their survival for future visits and for other fans.  Fans may also act as unofficial cheerleaders through their online connections on platforms like Instagram and Facebook. One popular fan practice is the sharing of photos and trip reports, or explaining how to find specific locations.  If fan touristsâ post-lockdown experiences are positive, they can be a valuable source of word-of-mouth recommendations that encourage both fellow fans, and more general tourists, to return to specific tourist sites.  Fans are likely to visit sites multiple times. Their repeat trips offer economic benefits for tourism providers, but this also means that they may have different experiences at sites over time as the coronavirus recovery progresses. They can use this to report on their trips, which may reassure others that it is safe to visit.  Already, films and TV shows beloved to fans are being used to welcome visitors back. For instance, a new mural of the characters in TV show Derry Girls has been unveiled at City of Derry Airport.  Fansâ close connection with texts and other media makes them a valuable asset. The relationships between media and fan tourists, local and national organisations, and businesses and operators look set to be more important than ever.",https://theconversation.com/how-fans-of-outlander-and-game-of-thrones-can-help-the-uk-tourist-industry-recover-142695,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,a4ccc16d012a409ce9fd916f3b31a03d7c4ec383473b427c9c2d0fafb3131041,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:39.862260,2020-08-04T12:02:57Z,Muddy knees and climbing trees: how a summer playing outdoors can help children recharge,"Most adults will remember spending much of their childhood playing outdoors without much parental supervision. But fears for childrenâs safety plus the demands of modern life mean many parents donât allow their children the same freedoms.  We live in an age where people have distanced themselves from nature in favour of a world full of technology and indoor pursuits. Natural England confirms that only one in nine children have access to natural environments throughout their early lives. And a poll from 2016 found 75% of children in the UK spend less leisure time outdoors than prison inmates.  Research has found this alienation from nature makes children less resilient and less able to cope with the increasing anxieties they have about growing up in the modern world.  And Public Health England has shown that the communities hardest hit are low income and black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME). Children in these often inner city communities are six times more likely to have no previous experience of activity in outdoor spaces.  The great outdoors  It has long been recognised that humans are drawn to all things alive and natural. And for children, getting outdoors helps to aid their exploration of the world. Itâs how they learn best â through an environment made up of âloose partsâ, which allows for creativity and problem solving. They use their ingenuity to make up games, construct new imaginary worlds and develop their own solutions to problems.  Early advocates of outdoor playall recognised the many positives it can bring. But more recently, outdoor play has been linked to extended focus on tasks and the ability for children to be self-directed in their approach to learning.  This is especially significant for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as time outdoors can increase concentration and lower hyperactive symptoms.  Health benefits  For all children, spending time outdoors increases exposure to light. This is important because it stimulates the pineal gland, which helps to regulate hormones and is vital to remain healthy.  More exposure to sunlight also increases synchronicity to the natural â or circadian - rhythms of the day. This means that as it gets later in the day, childrenâs brains start to release the hormone melatonin which encourages drowsiness in preparation for sleep.  On top of this, exposure to sunlight builds vitamin D in the body â an important vitamin for maintaining strong bones and preventing chronic diseases.  Active play also allows for more physical and strenuous activities and increases aerobic exercise, so children burn more calories â helping to prevent obesity and strengthen bones and muscles.  Respect for the environment  Children who spend more time in nature also express more appreciation for conservation of the environment and more interest in how important animals are for our survival.  Evidence shows that time spent outdoors as a child is positively linked with higher environmental literacy and a healthy respect for the world that lasts into adulthood.  Playing outdoors also exposes children to opportunities to extend themselves and push the boundaries of their capabilities. In Norway, for example, from the age of three, children are taught to climb trees, make dens, build fires and use knives when they attend kindergartenâ.  This exposure to risk in a controlled environment increases childrenâs sense of exhilaration, which enables them to gain confidence and push themselves onto more challenging activities.  Get your kids outdoors  The summer holidays are the perfect opportunity to get outdoors with your children. Donât underestimate the positive effects of something as simple as a family walk in the park, beach or woodland. Let them jump in puddles and streams, climb trees and gather objects from the wild.  You can also organise games for when youâre out and about. The Matchbox Challenge, for example, is a great game for outdoors. Give each child a matchbox and a time limit to find as many natural objects they can and put them in the matchbox. At the end of the time limit allow them to devise a points system for the different types of objects they found. Add up the points and see who has won.  Another one to try is journey stick, which allows children to create a memento of a walk and the things found. Finding a large stick is the first part of the challenge. Then as your child finds a new item, tie or tape it to the stick. Once at home, your child can retell their journey with the reminders on their journey stick.  Thereâs also hug a tree â in pairs children take it in turns to be blindfolded while a parent or sibling takes them to a tree. They use their senses to ""get to knowâ the tree. Their guide returns them to the original spot and they must guess which tree they hugged.  These are just some suggestions, but above all else, allow your children to explore the environment, get dirty and take risks this summer â theyâll thank you for it in the long run.",https://theconversation.com/muddy-knees-and-climbing-trees-how-a-summer-playing-outdoors-can-help-children-recharge-141162,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,fb65685022f30b5ccf92e85f9f15dca7f1ea5292266b6cc09cde8922c750a302,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:40.096003,2020-08-04T12:02:10Z,Antibiotic resistance: cheap diagnostic test could be a saviour,"With the worldâs attention focused on combating COVID-19, it is easy to forget the other significant threat to public health and the global economy â the rapid rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Yet the problem has not disappeared. Indeed, the pandemic is probably accelerating it.  Predicted to cause 10 million deaths a year by 2050 if left unchecked, AMR occurs where microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites, develop resistance to antimicrobial drugs (such as antibiotics, antivirals and antimalarials). AMR is a natural process that is fundamental to the survival and evolution of microbes, but it is exacerbated by the misuse and overuse of antimicrobial agents. Poor sanitation, inadequate infection control and inappropriate food handling are also major contributors.  The bulk of AMR is antibacterial resistance. What is particularly disturbing today is that many common bacterial infections are now resistant to several antibiotics. This includes pneumonia, urinary tract infections, gonorrhoea, tuberculosis and gastrointestinal diseases, such as typhoid.  The threat of AMR is now so severe that many fear it could soon wipe out many of the advances medicine has made over the last century. In 2014, the World Health Organization warned we could be moving to a situation where even minor injuries could cause life-threatening infections. Major surgery, diabetes management and treatment for cancer will also become highly risky without effective antibiotics, as will caesarean sections and IVF.  Those infected with a drug-resistant pathogen need many more tests, lengthier hospital stays and much more intensive care than those with non-resistant infections. They are also much more likely to have a poorer clinical outcome and die.  The AMR burden is likely to fall hardest on poor countries where antibiotics can be bought over the counter and healthcare is limited. These countries, which already have a high prevalence of infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis and HIV, are now having to cope with the added burden of COVID-19 significantly disrupting access to health services.  Critically, lockdown has reduced or suspended routine vaccination, which both the UN and the WHO fear could unleash a resurgence of preventable infectious diseases, such as diphtheria, measles and polio, once societies reopen. It has also interrupted the carefully monitored delivery of treatments for diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV, which are essential to controlling their spread and minimising the development of drug resistance.  COVID-19 has also led to large numbers of patients being hospitalised. Given that hospitals are an ideal environment for multidrug-resistant organisms to spread, this is inadvertently leading to an increase in antibiotic use. Together with the widespread use of biological agents for personal and environmental disinfection, this has set up the perfect conditions for accelerating AMR.  Until the 1990s many were optimistic that AMR could be solved by the judicious use of antibiotics and the development of new antibiotics. Since then, however, the number of new antibiotics being developed has rapidly declined and the pipeline of new drugs is now close to collapse. The only way forward is to slow down the problem by ramping up testing. As with COVID-19, the solution for AMR is âtest, test, testâ. However, testing for AMR is almost entirely missing.  No quick and reliable tests  Faced with a patient with a severe infection, many doctors are forced to prescribe an antibiotic without testing how susceptible or resistant the best-guessed condition is to the antibiotics they have prescribed. This is because there is a lack of quick, reliable and affordable diagnostic tests.  Most infections are diagnosed by sending a patientâs sample to a laboratory for it to be cultivated and tested against different antimicrobial drugs to see which one kills the microorganism. Depending on what microbe is involved, this process can be slow. Bacteria that cause tuberculosis, for example, can take 30 days to culture.  Over the last decade, several molecular techniques have emerged that have helped speed up diagnosis. Designed to identify a microorganism and resistance, these tests can detect the presence or absence of genes or gene mutations for resistance to antibiotics. The major downside of these tests is that they are usually only available in well-resourced hospitals, are expensive, and need specially trained staff to interpret the results.  Scientists at the University of Cambridge are developing a simple, cheap and portable AMR diagnostic kit, packaged into a portable hand-luggage-sized suitcase with a solar-panelled battery, that can be used anywhere in the world. It is modelled on a test for cholera being trialled in India and Malawi. One of the advantages with the test is that its results can be read easily off a molecular dipstick and so can directly guide clinical decision-making. With the help of a mobile phone app included in the package, the data would also help any connected centralised surveillance system to track the spread of AMR.  Ankur Mutreja , Author provided (No reuse)  Unlike conventional testing, the Cambridge test can determine the antibiotics resistance profile of a sample without needing to identify the pathogen. It will also be highly dynamic and customisable because the dipstick probes can be quickly changed to detect a particular range of antibiotic-resistant genes found locally. These genes vary considerably by country and even by hospital. And they change over time.  Able to be deployed outside the hospital and in remote areas, the diagnostic kit would test a sample for AMR at a fraction of the cost of other molecular diagnostic instruments. Such a reduction in the cost of testing is crucial if the world is to move away from using broad-spectrum antibiotics and the over-prescription or futile use of these drugs.",https://theconversation.com/antibiotic-resistance-cheap-diagnostic-test-could-be-a-saviour-142778,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,d21c69da759a862cc9d339257885bc5d371bfb006c8bb1e777fbb5bbb663c2d5,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:40.307930,2020-08-04T11:42:12Z,Cursed: retelling of Arthurian legend puts women centre stage in an era of female leadership,"Netflixâs new series Cursed, based on the illustrated novel by Frank Miller and Tom Wheeler, is a retelling of the Arthurian legend â but like none you have seen before. The central character is not the young man destined to rule over Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table, the narrative that has come down through the centuries. In this version of the legends, the main character is a woman called Nimue.  In other tellings of the Arthurian legends, Nimue is usually a mysterious figure about whom little is known. She gives Arthur his sword and sometimes assists him, but she also (in Maloryâs Le Morte d'Arthur) strips Merlin, Arthurâs adviser, of his powers and traps him under a stone.  In Cursed, we meet Nimue as a young woman who is a member of the âfeyâ â a pagan magical minority population. Nimue and other members of her tribe are able to pass as human â but other fey tribes have wings, or scales, or even tusks or antlers, making blending in with the human population much more difficult.  When her village is destroyed by the Red Paladins â inquisitorial figures who seek to cleanse the land of all fey in the name of the Christian god â Nimue begins a journey to return the sword of the first kings to Merlin, her motherâs dying wish. The sword is sought by King Uther and his rivals as a means of proving their right to rule. Along the way, she encounters Arthur, a young mercenary, who will eventually help her in her journey.  Nimueâs role is just one way in which this series upends the traditional cycle of tales. As a retelling of Arthurian legend, Cursed is almost unrecognisable â Nimue, who usually dwells at the fringes of the story (as the mysterious Lady of the Lake, for example) has been brought centre stage. Instead of giving the sword to Arthur, or even bringing it to Merlin as initially instructed, she decides to keep the sword and proclaims herself the Fey Queen.  While viewers of Cursed will encounter many familiar names from Arthurian legend, including Uther Pendragon, Merlin, Morgana, Gawain, and even Lancelot and Perceval, they may be surprised by the depiction of these characters in the series.  Uther is a whiny man-child dominated in the political sphere by Lunete, the queen mother. Merlin, meanwhile, is a jaded alcoholic concealing that he has lost his magical powers. Even Arthur, although good-hearted, is a liar and a thief who initially steals the sword for himself. He proves himself by recognising Nimueâs authority and serving her cause (rather than the other way around).  Changing narrative  Yet the story of Arthur has always been open to adaptation. Maloryâs Le Morte d'Arthur â although recognised as the source of most modern Arthurian retellings â was itself an adaptation of earlier Arthurian narratives. Writing during the Wars of the Roses, Malory, a prisoner of war, used the story of King Arthur not only to look back at a lost golden age, but also to reflect values and ideals he wanted to celebrate in his own time.  Each retelling of the story reflects the time in which it is being told as well as its aspirations. For example, the BBCâs series Merlin, which ran from 2008 until 2012, also took an untraditional approach by portraying both Arthur and Merlin as young men. Merlin, far from being a source of wisdom, is still learning how to use his powers and frequently makes mistakes. Prince Arthur is brave, but also arrogant â and, in order to prove himself worthy of kingship, must come to understand that nobility of character is not limited to those of noble birth.  Netflix @2020  King Uther, Arthurâs father, although a strong king, represents everything Arthur must learn to reject. He is intolerant of those who are not like himself (especially magic users) and determined to maintain the social hierarchy at all costs. It is Arthur and his young friends who must make Camelot great. Thus, the series promotes tolerance and acceptance and the importance of valuing others based on their merits rather than the circumstances of their birth.  Female leadership  In Cursed the emphasis also falls on the younger characters. They are the ones with the power to change the world and save it from the excesses of an older generation characterised by its intolerance. In the persecution of the endangered fey minority by the Paladins, we can see the dangers of religious fanaticism. But this discrimination is not limited to the Paladins, their actions are tolerated and sometimes even condoned by the wider human population, who regard the fey with fear and suspicion. As in our time, racism is not limited to a few extremists.  But what is perhaps most compelling about Cursed is its emphasis on female power and agency. The series is dominated by its female characters â not just Nimue, but also Morgana, Lunete, Lenore and Red Spear (who is revealed in the novel as none other than Guinevere, a leader of a band of Vikings who assist Arthur and Nimue), who all exhibit different forms of leadership.  This female agency seems particularly relevant at a time when leaders such as Angela Merkle, Jacinda Ardern, Mette Frederiksen, Silveria Jacobs and Tsai Ing-wen are all praised for their handling of the coronavirus pandemic in Germany, New Zealand, Denmark, Sint Maarten and Taiwan respectively. Likewise, there is much speculation about who Joe Biden will choose as a female running mate in the 2020 US presidential election. In such times, the story of a woman rising to power to save her people is more relevant than ever.  Arthur may live on in legend as the âOnce and Future Kingâ, but his story must also remain relevant for the present. Perhaps, now, more than ever, we need versions of our legends that make us see these old stories in new ways.",https://theconversation.com/cursed-retelling-of-arthurian-legend-puts-women-centre-stage-in-an-era-of-female-leadership-143865,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,68a66882d77d8c0b6d05629a2b548c26e80a51956f503d3078b6bda123dacb93,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Our ability to accommodate maximum safety and capacity has been greatly reduced during the pandemic, raising concerns about the future layout of public spaces.  My research and development group at Utrecht University along with start-up uCrowds have deployed a crowd simulation framework to help manage groups of people in this new world of public space under coronavirus.  The software allows users to create and run models for simulating realistic crowd behaviour, including how people move around a space and how they avoid collisions within environments. Simulations are run in realistic environments to study the effectiveness of their methods.  How does the software work?  Simulated pedestrians in the software do not move around randomly; they have one or more destinations. They can either be alone or in groups.  One relatively recent addition we have made is that a certain percentage of the simulated people take up more space, for example those who are travelling in small, social groups. The pedestrians then walk to their destinations in a realistic manner, avoiding other people and obstacles.  We modelled the way people move in the simulations using 13 years of data on how real people move. We collected some of this from students who carried trackers while walking across hallways and other spaces. We also conducted experiments with groups of students at festivals, where much larger groups of people moved alongside each other.  Since our model is based around individuals and social groups, we have now been able to add effects of social distancing. All their interactions lead to the kinds of emergent behaviours we are observing in real crowds. Examples include lane formation (pedestrians following the people who walk in front of them when crowds got too busy), pressure waves, and more anticipation because individuals are trying to keep a greater social distance between one another.  Practical applications  How do we use this information to help with coronavirus planning? Crowd simulation models can be scaled up immensely. If you have a sufficiently fast computer, our simulation engine can simulate up to 550,000 people in real time.  The software can also make projections: for example, if you simulate 20,000 people, you can fast forward the simulation to 35 times the actual speed. That means that the software can also look into the future and warn officials to close off access routes in areas that are becoming too busy.  If governments use this kind of software, they can send text messages to peopleâs mobile phones to direct pedestrians to take other route options to their destinations. A pilot project is running at St Pancras railway station in the UK which demonstrates this technology.  The software has been previously used for the Grand DÃ©part of the Tour de France in 2015, which brought 800,000 spectators to Utrecht. Simulations in a virtual Utrecht supported the municipal government in planning the surroundings of the cycling course and testing the prognoses for the flows of the spectators. One of the scenarios included computing the maximum number of individuals that would safely fit on a square. When this number was reached in reality, the entrance to this square could be safely closed in time.  Simulating social distance  We have recently updated the simulation to reflect the social distancing measures in place in the Netherlands which require people to stay 1.5 metres apart.  Roland Geraerts , Author provided (No reuse)  The simulation does not simply set the minimum distance between simulated people to 1.5 metres, but takes into account the fact that people make imperfect estimations. Even the fact that people are becoming tired of coronavirus measures and are hence paying less attention to distancing is considered. The software also simulates groups containing members of the same household, which are moving closer together.  As the pandemic unfolds, this model can be used to get insights in the daily operation of train stations, airports, high streets or even festivals in this new 1.5-metre world. By simulating crowds at this distance, we hope to contribute to helping open up the economy in these bizarre times.",https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-using-crowd-simulation-to-encourage-social-distancing-143121,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,e89cc233563e7072dc803c55b9f7214f39edd32a67deb30d85d1541e72fda547,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Urban living brings many benefits, but city dwellers worldwide are seeing a rapid increase in noncommunicable health problems, such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease.  Some scientists now think this is linked to biodiversity loss â the ongoing depletion of the varied forms of life on Earth. The rate at which different species go extinct is currently a thousand times higher than the historical background rate.  Microbial diversity is a large part of the biodiversity that is being lost. And these microbes â bacteria, viruses and fungi, among others â are essential for maintaining healthy ecosystems. Because humans are a part of these ecosystems, our health also suffers when they vanish, or when barriers reduce our exposure to them.  The inner ecosystem  Our gut, skin and airways harbour distinct microbiomes â vast networks of microbes that exist in different environments. The human gut alone harbours up to 100 trillion microbes, which outnumbers our own human cells. Our microbes provide services that are integral to our survival, such as processing food and providing chemicals that support brain function.  Contact with a diverse range of microbes in our environment is also essential for bolstering our immune system. Microbes found in environments closer to the ones we evolved in, such as woodlands and grasslands, are called âold friendâ microbes by some microbiologists. Thatâs because they play a major role in âeducatingâ our immune systems.  Part of our immune system is fast-acting and non-specific, which means it attacks all substances in the absence of proper regulation. Old friend microbes from our environment help provide this regulatory role. They can also stimulate chemicals that help to control inflammation and prevent our bodies from attacking our own cells, or innocuous substances like pollen and dust.  Exposure to a diverse range of microbes allows our bodies to mount an effective defensive response against pathogens. Another part of our immune system produces tiny armies of âmemory cellsâ that maintain a record of all the pathogens our bodies encounter. This enables a rapid and effective immune response to similar pathogens in the future.  Read more: How capitalism ruined our relationship with bacteria  To help fight infectious diseases like COVID-19, we need healthy immune systems. But this is impossible without support from diverse microbiomes. Just as microbes have important roles in ecosystems, by helping plants grow and recycling soil nutrients, they also provide our bodies with nutrients and health-sustaining chemicals that promote good physical and mental health. This strengthens our resilience when facing diseases and other stressful times in our lives.  But our cities are often lacking in biodiversity. Most of us have swapped green and blue spaces for grey spaces â the concrete jungle. As a result, urban dwellers are far less exposed to a diversity of health-promoting microbes. Pollution can affect the urban microbiome too. Air pollutants can alter pollen so that itâs more likely to cause an allergic reaction.  âGermaphobiaâ, the perception that all microbes are bad, compounds these effects by encouraging many of us to sterilise all of the surfaces in our homes, and often prevents children from going outside and playing in dirt. The soil is one of the most biodiverse habitats on Earth, so urban lifestyles can really disadvantage young people by severing this vital connection.  People living in more deprived urban areas have poorer health, shorter life expectancies and higher rates of infections. Itâs no coincidence that these communities often lack accessible, high quality green and blue spaces. Theyâre also less likely to be able to afford, or have the time and energy to enjoy affordable fruit and vegetables.  What can we do?  We need to get serious about the urban microbiome.  Restoring natural habitats can help increase biodiversity and the health of city residents. Growing more diverse native plants, creating safe, inclusive and accessible green spaces and rewilding inner city and suburban parks can restore microbial diversity in urban life.  Our research is helping urban designers restore habitats in cities that can promote healthy interactions between residents and environmental microbes.  But access to these green and blue spaces, and affordable nutrition, must be improved. Support for allotments and community gardens could provide free, nutritious food and exposure to helpful microbes in one fell swoop, while sessions that teach people how to grow their own food could be prescribed by health professionals.  Promoting connections with nature â including the microbes many of us currently shun â should be a key part of any post-pandemic recovery strategy. We must protect and promote the invisible biodiversity that is vital to our personal and planetary health.",https://theconversation.com/biodiversity-loss-could-be-making-us-sick-heres-why-143627,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,fbc25c200836da0f263cf5cc7aa95f77a08358aa24281a29c25736386a763aa9,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Once one of the worldâs largest salt lakes, and still the countryâs largest lake, Urmia is now barely a tenth of its former size.  As the waters recede, extensive salt marshes are left exposed to the wind. These storms are getting saltier and are now happening more often â even in the cold and rainy seasons of the year. As more drying uncovers more salt marshes, things will only get worse.  Salt storms pose a direct threat to the respiratory health and eyesight of at least 4 million people living in both rural and urban areas around Lake Urmia. Increasing soil salinity reduces the yield of agricultural and orchard crops grown around the lake, while the lake has shrunk so much that boating is no longer possible, resulting in a loss of tourism.  This dramatic decline is down to human activity. Over the past three decades, Iran has followed a succession of five-year economic development plans, part of which involved providing large government loans for the agricultural sector to expand and switch from being primarily rain-fed to irrigated. To provide the necessary water for the farms, as well as for growing domestic and industrial use, more than 50 dams were constructed on rivers that drain much of north-western Iran and flow into the lake.  While these dams siphoned off the water that once fed the lake, the drying process was intensified by climate change. The rate of rainfall has reduced in recent decades and the Urmia basin has experienced several multi-year droughts.  All this has left a massively shrunken lake and a host of associated economic, social and health impacts. Yet whatâs happening with Lake Urmia is just one example of water-environmental problems emerging right across Iran.  Iran is getting warmer and drier  In a recent journal article, we examined how both climate change and human activity had affected hydrological changes in Iran in recent decades. The country has 30 main river basins, and we gathered three decades of key hydro-climatic data for each, including surface temperature, precipitation, how much water was stored underground in soil and rock, surface runoff (the amount of excess rainwater that cannot be absorbed by the soil), and measures of evaporation and transpiration from plants.  We then calculated the average values of each of these variables over two 15-year periods, 1986-2001 and 2002-2016, and compared the two. This allowed us to see what was changing in each of these basins and by how much.  Our work showed that Iranâs main river basins have got warmer but are receiving less precipitation, are storing less water underground, and seeing less runoff.  Tolga Subasi / shutterstock  Some river basins where precipitation and runoff decreased still saw an increase in evapotranspiration (the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration). This may seem odd at first, as less rainwater surely means there is less water to evaporate or for plants to transpire. Lake Urmia, for instance, is an endorheic basin, which means nothing flows out of it and all water that flows in eventually evaporates (this is why the lake is salty). But why would evapotranspiration have actually increased, even as the basin is fed by less water?  This is actually an indicator of human activity. First, all those dams generally increase the surface area of the body of water, compared to the natural flow before the dam was built. Artificial lakes and reservoirs, therefore, leave more water exposed to air and direct sunlight, thus increasing evaporation.  But itâs also down to farming. As more crops are grown, more water is transpired by plants â and more water is needed to grow those plants. To add water where needed, farmers have turned to groundwater and large-scale water transfer engineering projects.  This use of water to maintain and expand human activities is unsustainable and has serious environmental and socio-economic consequences, particularly in this dry part of the world, as seen by changes to Lake Urmia. Policymakers need to mitigate the adverse hydrological changes and associated socio-economic, environmental and health impacts, and move towards something more sustainable.",https://theconversation.com/iran-decades-of-unsustainable-water-use-has-dried-up-lakes-and-caused-environmental-destruction-140565,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,9e33241210c19787f352a99c9bd18a822b6fb1019ec38e7fe3e913307b67086f,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:41.033597,2020-08-03T15:21:10Z,How we found coronavirus in a cat,"Since the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, the potential role of animals in catching and spreading the disease has been closely examined by scientists. This is because the virus that causes COVID-19 belongs to the family of coronaviruses that cause disease in a variety of mammals.  The evidence suggests that this virus arose in bats and my colleagues at the University of Glasgow have recently determined that the sub-type of coronavirus to which the virus belongs has been circulating in the bat population since the 1940s.  So it makes sense for researchers to ponder whether the virus can be transmitted to companion animals, whether these animals can show symptoms of infection, and whether they may play any role in the epidemiology of the disease.  Cats are the UKâs most popular pet â a 2019 survey revealed there are almost 11 million felines in households across the country. Public concern about felines was initially raised when tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo in New York were found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes COVID-19.  There have also been sporadic reports of cats from COVID-19 households in Hong Kong, Belgium, France, Spain and the US which have tested positive for the virus.  So, could our domestic cat population be somehow involved in this pandemic here in the UK? We decided to find out.  Searching for coronavirus in UK cats  In early May, my colleagues and I were given ethical approval to retrospectively test cats for SARS-CoV-2 and work soon began screening routine respiratory samples taken from cats throughout the UK. We also launched an appeal to veterinary surgeons asking for samples from suspect cases.  After screening hundreds of samples, this collaborative effort eventually resulted in the detection of a cat with SARS-CoV-2 in the south of England, which had been sampled in mid-May. Further samples submitted to our veterinary colleagues at the Animal and Plant Health Agency revealed that this cat had developed an antibody response to the virus, demonstrating that it had indeed experienced a genuine infection and confirming it was not a simple case of sample contamination.  Circumstances indicate that the cat contracted the virus from its owners, who had previously tested positive for COVID-19.  At this point, the World Organisation for Animal Health was notified by the UK Chief Veterinary Officer and the press was alerted. We are currently preparing a paper on our findings for publication.  Should I be worried about my cat?  So, what does this case tell us? Our research coincided with the UK COVID-19 outbreak, focusing on cats experiencing respiratory symptoms. Our finding of a single infected individual among the hundreds screened tells us that infection in cats is relatively uncommon. This is reinforced by the fact that the other cat in the household never became infected, either by the owners or the infected cat.  Although the cat had been experiencing mild symptoms, including runny eyes and a snotty nose, these signs were consistent with feline herpesvirus infection, for which this cat also tested positive. There is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was making this cat ill and thankfully, the cat and its owners have all made a full recovery.  It is important to appreciate that while, to date, about 18 million people have tested positive for COVID-19, only a handful of infected cats have been detected around the world.  All available evidence suggests, therefore, that cats are not involved in spreading COVID-19. However, the importance of this type of animal surveillance work is clear, considering that a million mink have recently been culled in the Netherlands and Spain as they have been implicated in disease spread.  Our suspicion in the case of cats is that feline infections simply represent a âspill overâ from the human epidemic, and we are currently analysing the genome sequence of the virus from the case we found to investigate this hypothesis.  Our results and those from other studies, such as work in the US showing experimentally infected cats were only transiently infected, can provide reassurance to the pet-owning public.  Itâs very unlikely your cat has coronavirus, and if it does, it probably wonât be involved in spreading it any further.",https://theconversation.com/how-we-found-coronavirus-in-a-cat-143697,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,513b053362ed1b0d3dca690d24a6aec460738a87e1a034ff368e7a8c55d3b3d8,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Since becoming an icon for the conservation movement in the 1980s, 67 panda reserves and countless wildlife corridors have been created in the bamboo forested mountain ranges of central China. The most recent census suggests all that effort has paid off. There are 1,864 pandas living in the wild today, up from 1,000 in the late 1970s.  But in a new study, researchers discovered that whatâs good for the panda may not necessarily be good for the rest of the ecosystem. After studying images from camera traps over ten years, they found that large carnivores â the leopard, snow leopard, wolf and dhole (an Asian wild dog) â have retreated from where giant pandas have thrived. Their numbers appear to have fallen significantly in these panda reserves, and the researchers note that the wolf and dhole may be functionally extinct within them, while the tiger has already been driven to extinction here. Panda conservation doesnât appear to be benefiting other species, or the wider ecosystem.  These findings shake the foundations of one of conservationâs most enduring ideas â that investing time and money into protecting particular large, influential species can pay dividends for the other species and habitats they coexist with. In the aftermath of that revelation, what do we really know about how to protect ecosystems and save wildlife from extinction?  How to think about ecosystems  Single species conservation was the dominant idea during the latter half of the 20th century. Conservation groups and governments identified particular species in need of urgent help and used their images to raise public support to help save them from extinction.  The poster children of this approach were the giant panda and the tiger. Both of which have been success stories, for the target species at least.  But while lavishing these charismatic species with attention and resources, this approach tends to overlook less attractive species, such as worms, despite them potentially having more ecological value.  Today, conservationists place much greater emphasis on protecting ecosystems and entire landscapes. The logic being that you can more effectively maintain an areaâs ecology if you treat it as a functional system.  Jason Gilchrist, Author provided  A useful analogy is to compare an ecosystem with an organism, such as the human body. Each is made up of many working systems, whose roles are maintained by species in the case of the former, and organs in the latter.  A respiratory system needs healthy lungs, but both depend on the rest of the bodyâs systems. The lungs need healthy arms and legs to find and collect nourishment. The digestive system needs to be able to process that food to unlock the nutrients for the rest of the body, while the circulatory system needs to transport them to the lungs so they can do their work to keep the organism alive.  Alternatively, replace our organism with an aeroplane. For the aeroplane to fly and land safely, all the components need to work. If an engineer only maintains one component, like the engine, and ignores the wings, wheels and navigation system, the flight is going to end badly.  The lesson from both analogies is that all components and the roles they perform are necessary for keeping the whole functional and healthy. An aeroplane may only tolerate the loss of so many rivets, before losing one thatâs vital, or losing enough to cause mechanical breakdown. Losing the function of one organ can cause multiple systems to fail within the body.  Focusing on a single species in conservation isnât necessarily wrong, though. A focal species can act as a flagship, an ambassador that raises support (and money) for conservation of an entire area. Pandas are very good at this.  But there are also umbrella species. For example, beavers modify their habitats so extensively that they create numerous niches for other species to occupy. In that sense theyâre like an umbrella, that if protected, will provide shelter for other species.  So why did panda-targeted conservation fail to revive populations of large carnivores in central China? Well, a pandaâs habitat requirements are small compared to a wolfâs or a leopardâs, and the threats facing them in the wild are very different. Pandas are also famous for their specialised diet â a carnivore turned herbivore â and so their needs differ greatly from your average large predator. Put simply, a habitat catered to sedate, bamboo-munching pandas isnât likely to help a nomadic, meat-loving leopard.  Read more: How conserving nature's 'umbrella' species could benefit whole habitats  Conserving large carnivores  Large carnivores donât have it easy worldwide. They need large areas of suitable habitat and lots of prey. In most areas they once occupied, humans have destroyed habitat, removed native prey species and killed large carnivores by gun, trap or poison, either because they hunt livestock or because they are seen as a danger.  The tiger is one of the few large carnivores whose populations have increased in recent years. India has seen its tiger population grow by a third since 2014. Considering the challenges of coexisting with these large predators â animals that occasionally kill humans â this success is impressive.  Indiaâs approach to tiger conservation prizes tolerance, education and working closely with the communities that live alongside this species above all else. Part of that education is recognising the tiger as just one part of the ecosystem, all of which needs protection.  Rohan Chakravarty, Author provided  What the panda study tells us is that we cannot assume a flagship species will also be an umbrella species.

It was the year a seemingly small error in a major international report heralded huge changes in our understanding of what was happening to the Himalayan glaciers.  Just one year after Al Goreâs documentary An Inconvenient Truth sparked conversations about anthropogenic (human-made) global warming, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published its 4th Assessment Report. This state-of-the-science summary was the gold standard to inform the world about climate change. The report contained one small but serious error â that all glaciers in the Himalayas would vanish by the year 2035.  The scandal sparked a flurry of new research, including my own, and we can now see that some Himalayan glaciers will survive into the next century. The latest data tells us that if we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, then between one-third and one-half of glacier ice will be lost by 2100. If not, and we carry on with business as usual, then two-thirds of Himalayan glaciers will vanish by the end of this century.  Ann Rowan , Author provided  But how did such an error come to be presented as fact by a world-leading scientific organisation? This is a tale of repetitions and an apparently unintended typo lending credibility to an unfounded statement. The IPCC quoted a report from the World Wildlife Foundation, which had taken the Himalayan meltdown date from an interview in New Scientist. That interview quoted speculation by an Indian glaciologist, who apparently misquoted another scientistâs work predicting glaciers worldwide would shrink by 80% by 2350.  The IPCC did eventually apologise for their failure to identify this error. Although embarrassing, it did not undermine their core conclusions. The IPCC undertook to improve their peer-review process before their next report in 2013.  The Himalayas are sacred mountains. Their name in Sanskrit means âabode of snowâ. But glaciers are a political issue in central Asia. Glacier-fed rivers provide water to over a billion people for food production and hydropower. India and Nepal in particular rely on glacier melt water to buffer seasonal droughts before the summer monsoon. These countries are rapidly industrialising and generally oppose limiting their carbon emissions.  After the IPCC report, the Indian government acted quickly to suppress panic with a controversial discussion paper presenting selective evidence showing that glaciers in northern India and Pakistan were stable or even expanding. However, the Karakoram glaciers in question benefit from greater winter snowfall and cooler summers as a result of global heating. How persistent this Karakoram anomaly will be remains unknown.  Resolving a Himalayan error  Glaciologists were left wondering what the fate of Himalayan glaciers would be. Little research was being done and data was scarce. Problems with accessing remote, high-elevation glaciers in politically unstable regions deterred fieldwork. Civil war in Nepal, the Taliban in Pakistan and suspicion of foreign scientists in China and India made these mountains difficult places to work.  Field observations and surveys suggested that glaciers had not noticeably changed. Glaciologists soon realised that changes in ice volume were hidden by rock debris on the surfaces of many large glaciers. So measurements of changes in glacier area were misleading and concealed the scale of ice loss.  Then, in the early 2010s, rapid advances in satellite Earth observation technology and declassification of Cold War satellite photographs opened a window into these remote mountains. The scale of glacier change across the Himalayas could be seen for the first time.  The new satellite data allowed glaciologists to measure changes in glacier volume over a 40-year period. This revealed that nearly all Himalayan glaciers were shrinking at a similar rate.  The future of Himalayan glaciers  New research shows that the rate at which glacier ice is lost from the Himalaya has doubled in the last 20 years and is similar to the rate of ice loss globally. Although extreme altitudes were thought to protect glaciers from climate change, we now know that high mountains are warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet.  The proliferation of data allowed glaciologists to train computer models to project how glaciers will change in the future. These models tell us that between one-third and one-half of glacier ice in the Himalaya will be lost by 2100. If we donât act to keep climate change within the ambitious Paris Agreement target of 1.5â then two-thirds will be lost in the same period.  While the weakening of the summer monsoon and atmospheric pollution affect glacier life expectancy, rising global temperatures are causing Himalayan glaciers to shrink. These predictions are bad news for the one billion people who depend on glacier-fed rivers for water in spring at the start of the agricultural season.  As glaciers decline, droughts are becoming more frequent before the summer rains, putting intense stress on populations in southern and central Asia. Governments, including Indiaâs, have now recognised the scale of the problem. To avoid a humanitarian crisis, the world must keep global heating within a range that will limit glacier loss.",https://theconversation.com/two-thirds-of-glacier-ice-in-the-himalayas-will-be-lost-by-2100-if-climate-targets-arent-met-143207,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,37f18b66717fbbe022d8ac8616ce6cea41b06d3a8e8dcb1fe9bce76e04fa6425,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

But whenever we attempt to explain the under-representation of women in science, debunked myths seem to sneak back into the debate in different guises â no matter how often they are challenged. A century after the birth of Rosalind Franklin, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, itâs sadly time to once again shed light on the prejudices about womenâs brains and abilities.  The view that women are inferior to men has taken many different forms over the years. In the 19th century, a patriarchal anxiety emerged that exposure to the demands of scientific education would damage womenâs vulnerable biology. In 1886, William Withers Moore, then president of the British Medical Association, warned of the dangers of overeducating women as they could develop a disorder he called âanorexia scholasticaâ, which made women immoral, insane and asexual.  Jewish Chronicle Archive/Heritage-Images  In the 20th century, explanations focused more on female deficits in specific skill sets allegedly required for science â such as spatial cognition. Testosterone-fuelled male brains were seen to be hard-wired for the pursuit of science. The message was clear: women donât do science because they canât.  But there is increasingly strong evidence that females often outperform males in many spheres of science, neatly disproving the myth that women lack the cognitive capacity to do science. Even menâs âsuperiorâ skills in spatial cognition have been shown to be diminishing over time â with women even outperforming men in certain cultures.  The choosiness myth  Yet the myth keeps popping up, like whac-a-mole, in the form of a âfemale choosinessâ argument. This was characterised by the notorious Google memo in which Google engineer James Damore asserted that the biologically determined preferences of women meant that a gender equal distribution in technology was unlikely. Women, he argued, prefer âpeopleâ to âthingsâ.  But scientists have challenged this idea. Just because women are more likely to be nurses than men, and men are more likely to be bus drivers than women, doesnât necessarily mean that it is because they prefer either people or things. Women and men are encouraged to do different jobs by society from an early age. And women were long barred from jobs, such as bus driving in London.  Yet female choosiness continues to be used as an explanation for gender gaps in science. In 2018, two psychologists from the UK published a paper called âThe Gender-Equality Paradox in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Educationâ. The paradox refers to the fact that women are more likely to be underrepresented in the sciences in countries that have the highest levels of gender equality.  The authorsâ explanation for this was couched in two stages. One was that in the least gender equal countries, STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) jobs were better paid and so economic necessity drove the choices of both sexes. The second part of the explanation, backed up by some other scientists, was that in countries with better social and economic conditions, the ânatural expressionâ of âinnate differencesâ could emerge.  Having to acknowledge that there were no differences in performance on science subjects between males and females, a different form of the âcognitive capacityâ myth has emerged in the last couple of years. Females are universally better at reading, so they are more likely to achieve a sense of gratification by choosing non-scientific subjects and careers.  As it happens, a fierce debate is now raging in scientific circles about the paradox, particularly about the accuracy of the gender-equality measures used and the causal interpretation of the correlations found. This has forced the authors of the gender-equality paradox paper to issue a correction of their original data analysis â it turned out they had used a rather unusual way to calculate sex differences in STEM graduates. When using more standard approaches, such as looking at the difference between the percentage of STEM graduates who are female or male, one team of scientists said they couldnât replicate the results.  Many scientists argue that thereâs still bias and discrimination against women in gender-equal countries, and that may be why they opt out of science careers. History shows that women played a large part in the development of different scientific disciplines. But, as science became more professionalised, women were deliberately excluded from scientific institutions, explicitly based on their innate deficits.  One would like to think that we have put all of that behind us. But the underlying narrative still pops up in various forms, most likely putting women off. There is evidence of powerful beliefs that great scientists are born and not made â and, more particularly, are born male.  This is despite the fact that research has shown that the concept of a âmaleâ and âfemaleâ brain is flawed. The experiences you have can actually change the brain, including the stereotyping you face. If you are encouraged to read, your brain gets better at reading. Whatâs more, it has been shown that when people have negative thoughts about how well they will do on a task, they actually avoid it and perform worse.  Many factors related to success in science, including hiring and promotion, also show clear evidence of gender bias against women. In a large study of research reports in chemistry, female-led papers were more likely to be rejected by journals, and less likely to be cited.  Franklin no doubt had to deal with a lot of prejudice, with her role in discovering the structure of DNA going unacknowledged for a long time. It is heartbreaking that the message that science is not for women remains a powerful a century after her birth.",https://theconversation.com/the-female-brain-why-damaging-myths-about-women-and-science-keep-coming-back-in-new-forms-129310,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,9f721a5f9b377741a1408faf988c53bbf2f4acbb79a0640ce131e65a9faa3632,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:43.878281,2020-08-03T14:11:35Z,How lockdown changed peopleâs feelings about drinking and going back to the pub,"Among the raft of changes following the UKâs coronavirus lockdown in March 2020 was the closure of pubs â an integral part of British cultural life. While the 1990s heyday of pubs is long gone, they remain unique spaces where people can meet in a familiar environment and feel connected to a community. They also offer a culturally sanctioned space to consume large quantities of alcohol.  As academics who research peopleâs drinking habits, our attention immediately turned to how lockdown affected how much alcohol people are consuming. Thereâs been increasing concern about lockdown-induced harmful drinking and how this should be addressed as part of lockdown recovery. The latest survey findings suggest that more than one in four people drank more than usual during lockdown.  But our interviews with people over lockdown paint a more mixed picture. Part of some unpublished research weâre still working on, they suggest that, although many people missed pubs, they are not necessarily ready to rush back to those that have reopened.  Home drinking vs going dry in lockdown  During lockdown, weâve been interviewing a cross-section of UK society about their drinking habits. All self-defined as people who âdrank sociallyâ prior to lockdown, although there was some variation in peopleâs pre-lockdown drinking practices (from the odd drink at home to daily drinking or regular pubbing and clubbing), and in the ways they are drinking during lockdown.  For some, the unsettling experience of unstructured daily routines and lockdown-induced stress seemed to contribute to drinking more (and more often) during lockdown. One implication of pubs shutting may be a gradual acclimatisation to drinking at home. Following the rise in alcohol sales in shops, health professionals and academics have voiced concerns about increased solitary drinking during lockdown due to boredom or to ease stress.  Our data tentatively mirrors some of these concerns. Mel*, a 37-year-old furloughed project manager with a young daughter was surprised to find that she was drinking five or six nights a week compared to three or four before lockdown, with alcohol helping her to relax and break up the day during the pandemic.  But others we spoke to used lockdown as an opportunity to stop drinking altogether. And some found moderate (or reduced) alcohol consumption more achievable and attractive than pre-lockdown thanks to the closure of pubs and lack of socialising.  Some of our interviewees said they only drank socially and reported having been galvanised to cut back or quit booze altogether, without fearing the social repercussions that might have accompanied this choice pre-lockdown. For example, Alison, a 41-year-old lecturer and relatively regular pub goer, had used lockdown as an opportunity to âget healthyâ by stopping drinking almost completely, changing her diet and exercising.  Whether or not they will continue this post-lockdown is another matter. Research suggests that maintaining any healthier lifestyle changes (around alcohol, stopping smoking and exercise) may be easier for people in more privileged and financially stable situations.  The virtual pub  Some of our participants who expressed a reluctance to drink alone and missed the sociability of going to pubs talked about the value of connecting virtually, drinking with friends or family on video calls during lockdown. Our own previous research shows lots of links between alcohol use and friendships and the accounts of our participants partly concern alcoholâs positive role in facilitating intimacy and connection during online meetings in lockdown.  Some talked about attempts to recreate the pub environment at home, even calling their online meet-ups âthe virtual pubâ. They also ran pub quizzes online and two creative housemates we spoke to created a nightclub in their garden shed, decking the space out with lights and playing loud music.  Research shows that not drinking when others are can come with negative consequences such as the judgement of others, feelings of missing out and social exclusion. So while having virtual pub or nightclub sessions may have helped people relax, they could also involve pressure to drink alcohol.  Last orders?  Even those who enjoyed virtual pubbing tended to report that nothing could quite recreate the real pub. Our interviewees expressed how they missed face-to-face socialising and the opportunity to try sips of one anotherâs ales. In this sense, the reopening of pubs was sometimes met with enthusiasm.  Others were aware that the reopening of pubs does not signify a return to normality. Pubs that have reopened have strict social-distancing measures in place. There are apps to reserve tables and order drinks, along with strict rules about the proximity of bar gatherings. So pubs are not currently places where spontaneous, intimate and fluid interactions are possible.  Meanwhile, some of our interviewees expressed ambivalence or concern about returning to the local pub. Lois, 58, for example, questioned whether pubs operating under these new conditions are really authentic pubs, and expressed worries about the safety of being back in these spaces (particularly as one of her regular pub friends has been shielding at home). These are important considerations and it remains to be seen when â if indeed ever â pubs will be the pubs that we knew before as we navigate the post-lockdown world.  *Names have been changed.",https://theconversation.com/how-lockdown-changed-peoples-feelings-about-drinking-and-going-back-to-the-pub-143759,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,a02d163d961a29137872a38d6bbba695301ac757af8e3198f2c5d5655f083075,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:44.043434,2020-08-03T13:04:40Z,Sperm fooled scientists for 350 years â they spin not swim,"Sperm is critical for the fertilisation of almost every living organism on our planet, including humans. To reproduce, human sperm have to swim a distance equivalent to climbing Mount Everest to find the egg. They complete this epic journey simply by wiggling their tail, moving fluid to swim forwards. Though over 50 million sperm will fail to reach the egg â the equivalent to more than six times the entire population of London or New York â it only takes one single sperm in order to fertilise an egg that will eventually become a human being.  Sperm was first discovered in 1677 â but it took roughly 200 years before scientists agreed on how humans are actually formed. The âpreformationistsâ believed that each spermatozoa contained a tiny, miniaturised human â the homunculus. They believed that the egg simply provided a place for the sperm to grow.  On the other hand, the âepigenesistsâ argued that both males and females contributed to form a new being, and discoveries in the 1700s showed more evidence for this theory. Though scientists now better understand the role that sperm plays in reproduction, our latest research has discovered that sperm have actually been fooling scientists this whole time.  One of the first microscopes was developed in the 17th century by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. He used a blob of molten glass that he carefully ground and polished to create a powerful lens. Some of them could magnify an object 270 times. Remarkably, a better lens was not created for over 200 years.  Leeuwenhoekâs lenses made him the first explorer of the microscopic world, able to see objects including bacteria, the inside of our cells â and sperm. When Leeuwenhoek first discovered sperm, he described it as a âliving animalculeâ with a âtail, which, when swimming, lashes with a snakelike movement, like eels in waterâ.  Strikingly, our perception of how sperm swims hasnât change since. Anyone using a modern microscope today still makes the very same observation: sperm swim forward by wiggling their tail from side-to-side. But as our latest research shows, weâve actually been wrong about how sperm swim for the last 350 years.  Using state-of-the-art 3D microscopy technology, our team of researchers from the UK and Mexico, were able to mathematically reconstruct the rapid movement of the sperm tail in 3D. Not only does spermâs size make them difficult to study â its tail only measures half a hairâs breadth â theyâre also fast.  Their tailâs whip-like movement is capable of beating over than 20 swimming-strokes in less than one second. We needed a super-fast camera capable of recording over 55,000 pictures in one second mounted in a fast oscillating stage to move the sample up and down at an incredibly high rate â effectively scanning the sperm tail while swimming freely in 3D.  What we found surprised us. We discovered that the sperm tail is in fact wonky and only wiggles on one side. While this should mean the spermâs one-sided stroke would have it swimming in circles, sperm have found a clever way to adapt and swim forwards: they roll as they swim, much like the way otters corkscrew through water. In this way, the wonky one-sided stroke evens out as sperm rolls allowing it to move forwards.  The spermâs rapid and highly synchronised spinning causes an illusion when seen from above with 2D microscopes - the tail appears to have a side-to-side movement. However, this discovery shows that sperm have developed a swimming technique to compensate for their lop-sidedness. In doing so they have also ingeniously solved a mathematical puzzle: by creating symmetry out of asymmetry.  The sperm body spins at the same time that the tail rotates around the swimming direction. Sperm âdrillsâ into the fluid like a spinning top by rotating around itself whilst its tilted axis rotates around the centre. This is known in physics as precession, much like the precession of the equinoxes in our planet.  Computer-Assisted Semen Analysis (CASA) systems, in use today, both in clinics and for research, still use 2D views of the spermâs movement. Like Leeuwenhoekâs first microscope, they are still prone to this illusion of symmetry while assessing semen quality. Symmetry (or the lack of it) is one identifying trait that may impact fertility.  The scientific tale of the sperm tail follows the route of every other area of research: advances in understanding sperm movement are highly dependent upon the development of technologies in microscopy, recording and, now, mathematical modelling and data analysis. The 3D microscopy technology developed today will almost certainly change the way we analyse semen in future.  This latest discovery, with its novel use of 3D microscope technology combined with mathematics, may provide fresh hope for unlocking the secrets of human reproduction. With over half of infertility caused by male factors, understanding the human sperm tail is fundamental for future diagnostic tools for identifying unhealthy sperm, and improving fertility.",https://theconversation.com/sperm-fooled-scientists-for-350-years-they-spin-not-swim-140669,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,f3c562adb7d33665791effa0a18fba7fe020d9f89305e26e14b7525746db8cf2,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:45.327656,2020-08-03T11:59:34Z,But is it art? Standup comedy and the quest for cultural credibility,"Arts Council England (ACE) has recently taken the unprecedented step of including comedy as a form of theatre under the terms of the Culture Recovery Fund, part of the emergency response package to help cultural institutions recover from the blow they have taken during the pandemic. But the council has expressly stated on its website that this was mandated by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and does not mean comedy clubs will be eligible for future ACE funding.  This singling out of comedy clubs once again brings into focus the disdain that the ACE has displayed for standup in the past and means now is the perfect time to reassess standup comedy as art.  Standup comedy is not created purely by the performer, but as a collaborative production between the performer, the audience, the venue and the promoter. In the same way a theatre is arranged to support dramatic performance or a gallery is lit to display paintings, so too must a standup comedy gig be presented in such a way that it contextualises the performance to come â the iconic image of the single microphone on a stand in a spotlight is evocative of standup comedy without anything needing to be said.  Unlike many other art forms, standup performance is more akin to a reactive conversation, albeit with laughter and other reactions forming the bulk of the audience response. And, in turn, this instant audience critique often shapes the unfolding production as the performer reacts. Finally, it is the job of the promoter and compÃ¨re, through advertising the gig to designing the line-up of the show and the introducing of the artists, to create an atmosphere that the standup comedy can flourish in.  At first glance a performance may seem fleeting and inconsequential, something that will only be remembered by the audience that witnessed it. But, for the comedian, each performance shapes and recontextualises their set ready for the next gig. A standup comedian may work on a routine for years, honing and shaping each line, each joke and each pause with every performance. So each gig creates something unique that is tied inexorably to the people and place who witnessed it.  A gig is not just a venue, but all the contextual understanding that goes into making it a space to present comedy and support critique. An audience is not just a collection of strangers, but a collective who are guided through previous experience or through a skilled compÃ¨re what to expect from a standup comedy gig and how to constructively critique the performers.  No laughing matter  When viewed as a collection of creative spaces for the production and critique of comedy, the vitality and energy of the circuit becomes visible â not just as a way for comedians to make a living but as part of the very fabric of standup comedy itself. The lifeline provided by the Culture Renewal Fund means that more clubs will survive, that less collective experience will be lost from the circuit as a whole.  But a lot will depend on what happens in the next few months. An emergency survey by the recently founded Live Comedy Association found that 58% of the industry rely on live comedy for more than 50% of their annual income and that 57% have already lost 50% of their personal income. Further, 59% of comedians said they would need to leave the industry in the next six months if live events continue to be unfeasible.  This loss would be massive for the circuit, not just on a personal level but in terms of lost experience. Learning standup comedy relies on mentoring â when you are starting out there is very little external to the comedy circuit to guide you, no equivalent of a drama school and only two universities offering undergraduate degrees in comedy writing and performance. The only people who can tell you why comedy is done the way it is are the people who do it, day in and day out.  Grand tradition  Standup comedy in its present incarnation has been part of the British cultural zeitgeist for more than 50 years. It has evolved from music-hall singers, front-cloth comics and variety acts of the early 20th century to the performers who travelled the often politically divergent circuits of working menâs clubs, folk clubs and London standup comedy clubs of the seventies.  This was then transformed with the alternative comedy boom of the 80s, the lad-culture drenched 90s and was colonised through panel shows which became the mainstay of TV schedules of the noughties, most recently spawning the sprawling DIY scene of the last decade. Here weâve seen amateur, professional and experimental acts alike welcomed and encouraged by gigs created by fellow comedians not for profit, but to provide the most important resource of all â stage time, the five to ten minutes where the standup comedian creates and hones their art.  Standup comedy will survive. The current restrictions brought by the pandemic are breeding technical innovation through virtual performances that are accessible to anyone with internet access. Now is the ideal time to invest artistic credibility in something that is a fundamental fixture of British life and a very broad church. Invest now in âart for arts sakeâ to ensure the future of standup comedy, for all our sakes.",https://theconversation.com/but-is-it-art-standup-comedy-and-the-quest-for-cultural-credibility-143711,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,a1e9b70e76d0047e6a29b347cd26088446708807227528af39c7dd75d26ab946,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:45.528954,2020-08-03T11:43:01Z,Do we need a national day of mourning after the coronavirus pandemic?,"At the end of July, the charity Marie Curie UK launched a campaign for a national day to âreflect, grieve and rememberâ the thousands of people who have died during the COVID-19 pandemic. The charity pointed out the incongruity between the scale of bereavement since March 23 and the absence of familiar mourning rituals.  Indeed, the absence of public mourning during the pandemic is striking â particularly in Britain, where the closest equivalent to a patriotic national day is Remembrance Day.  While Remembrance Day lacks the celebratory parades and fireworks of national days in other countries, it carries the same effect: mourning the dead binds people together through shared memories, rituals and values. Mourning, in short, creates a sense of solidarity, and even shared identity, amid a shared loss. That solidarity is neither arbitrary nor apolitical. Remembrance Day, for example, gives prominent roles to royals and politicians and invokes courage, heroism and sacrifice.  Since mourning serves so many important purposes for individuals and nations alike, this raises the question of what happens in its absence. The alternative to mourning is melancholia: the denial that a loss is real, the inability to make sense of it or learn from it and, ultimately, the inability to move on.  Like mourning, melancholia may apply to individuals and groups alike. At the national level, without formally acknowledging loss, governments may find it easier to suppress difficult memories â such as of state racism, empire or genocide. In each case, there is a fear that acknowledging the horror of the past will threaten the identity of the nation in the present. Officially recognising Britainâs colonial atrocities, for example, would undermine the myth that Britain is fundamentally more liberal and tolerant than its European neighbours.  Mourning and melancholia  The same is true of the COVID-19 crisis: the way we remember Britainâs experience of the pandemic will shape the way we understand Britain at large. Grappling with difficult memories enables us to critique leaders, policies and even identities. But whether a national day of mourning would achieve this very much depends on how it is framed.  The UK government has stopped holding daily press briefings on COVID-19. Over the summer, the rainbows in front windows have begun to fade and weekly claps for the NHS have ended. The public discussion of COVID-19 has shifted away from the death toll and towards the politics of the lockdown. We talk about the reopening of pubs and restaurants, wearing masks and the logistics of taking holidays. These stories are far removed from the jarring images of military convoys transporting bodies in Bergamo, or of mass graves in New York, that circulated in the early months of the pandemic.  PA  If we understand the absence of mourning as melancholia, then this gives us insight into why death is so absent from representations of the pandemic in Britain. Prime Minister Boris Johnson touted the declining daily death toll as a âmassive successâ but the UKâs death toll is the fourth highest in the world. The Office for National Statistics has revealed that England had the highest excess mortality rate in Europe during the first six months of 2020. Within this context, acknowledging the scale of death would betray the idea of Britain as resilient, sovereign and a world leader in public health. It would throw into question the governmentâs claim to legitimacy. Many people would feel that Britain had lost its sense of self.  The high stakes of mourning and melancholia provide some insight into what pandemic bereavement might look like in the future. The Marie Curie initiative is likely to gain the governmentâs endorsement, in large part because it appeals to solidarity and national character. Its slogan, #UniteInMemory, makes it clear that the charityâs goal is to shore up solidarity rather than challenge the governmentâs handling of the pandemic.  Within the initiativeâs remit is every death that has occurred in Britain since March 23. These are linked by the survivorsâ inability to âproperly say goodbye to loved ones, comfort or even hug each otherâ because of lockdown rules. The lockdown is framed as a shared experience of sacrifice that reveals national character.  Focusing on individual deaths, however, also limits what mourning can achieve. An alternative to this approach would acknowledge, and grieve, the governmentâs failure to control the pandemic and Britainâs disproportionately high coronavirus death toll. By extension, it would mourn the myth of British exceptionalism â and of a particular idea of Britain itself. It is highly unlikely that such an approach would receive the endorsement of Johnsonâs government. Until this narrative takes hold, however, any state-sanctioned national day of mourning will bear a closer resemblance to melancholia.",https://theconversation.com/do-we-need-a-national-day-of-mourning-after-the-coronavirus-pandemic-143772,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,d2da6caaf87b9efe8d65d026517107c460081d38d6bfafaa508d9a8d0c2121ce,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

But amid the coronavirus pandemic, hundreds of thousands of Belarusians have attended rallies to show their support for Lukashenkoâs opponents â including Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the wife of one candidate arrested and barred from standing.  Lukashenko has faced opposition before. In 2006 and 2010 Belarusian citizens attempted to call for democratic reforms, but presidential candidates ended up in prison or exile. Protests calling for political changes are now taking place at an unprecedented scale â and are being brutally suppressed.  Lukashenko was once popular and seen as charismatic. But he has become increasingly authoritarian during his 26-year tenure and now faces strong public resistance.  Dmitry Astakhov/ Sputnik/Gove  Coronavirus hits public trust  As of August 3, Belarus had registered 68,067 coronavirus cases and 567 deaths. It is one of the few European countries (along with Sweden) that has not introduced lockdown and strict coronavirus containment measures. Lukashenko has downplayed the risks of COVID-19 in an effort to keep the economy going.  Inadequate response to the pandemic coupled with economic decline have undermined public trust in the political leadership. In the absence of an effective government response, Belarusians had to protect themselves. Some businesses shifted to home working and volunteers have provided personal protective equipment to medical workers. Despite the World Bank forecasting a âsevere shockâ to the Belarusian economy and high risk to public health, the election has not been postponed.  Candidates out, one by one  Until a few months ago, it seemed Lukashenko would face three main challengers in the presidential race: Viktor Babaryko, Sergey Tikhanovsky and Valery Tsepkalo. But now none of them will be on the ballot.  Babaryko, the former head of Belgazprombank, the local unit of Russiaâs Gazprombank, was considered the strongest opponent. He collected over 400,000 ballot access signatures during his campaign, exceeding the necessary minimum of 100,000. But on June 18, Babaryko and his son Eduard were arrested, accused of financial crimes and tax evasion.  Tikhanovsky, a blogger who runs the YouTube channel Country for Life, was also considered a strong opponent. Tikhanovsky had labelled Lukashenko a âcockroachâ, calling on Belarusians to âstop the cockroachâ.  In May, Tikhanovsky was detained and charged for an unsanctioned public gathering and violating public order. Rights group Amnesty International recognises both Babaryko and Tikhanovsky as prisoners of conscience.  The third main candidate, Tsepkalo, served as the Belarusian ambassador to the US, founded the countryâs own tech park modelled on Silicon Valley and once advised Lukashenko on science and technology. But at the end of June, Tsepkalo had 100,000 signatures of support invalidated, which blocked him from continuing in the presidential race.  A new challenger  On July 14, Babaryko and Tikhanovsky were both barred from running in the election by the Belarus Central Election Commission (CEC). The following day queues of people lined up at the CEC to file complaints about the decision.  The arrests of Babaryko and Tikhanovsky and refusal of their registrations triggered protests in the capital, Minsk, and major cities in which hundreds were arrested.  Lukashenkoâs rivals subsequently united their campaigns behind Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the wife of Sergey Tikhanovsky. She has unexpectedly become a revolutionary figurehead and her recent campaign rally on July 30 in Minsk gathered over 60,000 supporters.  Tatyana Zenkovich/EPA  Still, Belarus is a tough political environment for women. In May, Lukashenko said the nationâs constitution was ânot made for a womanâ as president, and that âour society has not matured to vote for a womanâ. Politically active women and women partners of political activists are often attacked, including via messages containing threats of sexual violence or threats that their children will be taken into state custody.  Outmoded tactics for a young generation  Lukashenkoâs opponents have been using Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Viber messenger to get their message out rather than heavily censored traditional state TV and newspapers.  Lukashenko used to be able to rely on propaganda tools based on the memory of the second world war, hunger and devastation, and the need to maintain stability. But these are no longer cutting through to young Belarusians â especially those who were born after he came to power. Many are now demanding democratic changes.

In the UK, the NHS had to quickly put measures in place to ensure that it could safely continue to treat those in most need. This has meant a scaling back of routine services and a hold on all non-emergency treatment. Yet babies have continued to be born.  These changes, although necessary, have had a sizeable impact on the experience of pregnancy and birth. Face-to-face appointments with midwives have been reduced as much as possible and exchanged for telephone consultations in order to keep the physical contact to a minimum. A survey by the Royal College of Midwives (RCOM) found 78% of midwifery leaders had ended face-to-face visits.  Home births have been reduced or removed as an option across many NHS trusts, with multiple midwife-led birthing centres also closed. This is despite the RCOM and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists both advocating for the continuation of a midwife-led approach wherever possible as it been deemed the most safe and effective form of care. NHS trusts have had had to weigh up risk and make decisions based on their individual resources as to how to safely administer maternity care while also managing the extra demands of COVID-19.  Read more: Pregnant during the coronavirus crisis? Don't panic  This has, of course, happened before. Any crisis in healthcare demands similar actions to be taken. I research how similar challenges were managed during the second world war. The way in which the pandemic has altered the maternity experience has unexpected echoes with these wartime expectant mothers. In the absence of the support of friends and family and with access to maternity care restricted, giving birth in a time of national emergency is a unique and isolating experience.  Emergency maternity service  In the prelude to war in 1939, the UK government needed to strategise swiftly to ensure there were resources to care for war casualties and cover existing medical demand. The result was the establishment of the Emergency Medical Service and within it, the Emergency Maternity Service.  Maternity homes, hospitals and large properties in rural areas were commandeered to create a network of emergency maternity hospitals and later, hostels. Women in their final four weeks of pregnancy were strongly advised to evacuate from high-risk cities to billets near to these hospitals to await the arrival of their baby. On September 2, 1939, over 12,000 pregnant women left their city homes to wait out the final weeks of their pregnancy in the countryside.  These arrangements meant huge disruption to existing maternity services. By the summer of 1939, plans were made for 75% of the midwives working in hospitals in London to be transferred to work with war casualties, removing vital local maternity provision. This was a problem repeated nationally as midwives were redeployed to the emergency homes.  Although uptake of the Emergency Maternity Service beds was initially slow, as the war progressed and the birth rate unexpectedly rose, urban maternity services were so stretched that many women were left with no choice but to evacuate in order to access care.  The emotional toll  This wartime situation may seem far removed from experience of mothers in 2020. But in both cases, a national emergency shaped the birth experience of mothers by reducing or eliminating options.  In the years before the war, home delivery by midwife was generally the norm, but the diffusion of support networks by war, bomb-damaged housing, and a lack of midwives, meant that the choice of a home birth was removed for many city women. For those in more rural locations, the shortage of midwives due to their deployment to others areas caused similar problems.  Although home birth is much less common today, with only 2% of babies born at home in the UK in 2018, its withdrawal or reduction as an option for many is problematic for expectant mothers concerned about the risks of a hospital setting during a pandemic.  Even now, as lockdown measures are eased in the UK, many women are not permitted to have partners or chosen support with them during routine appointments, scans or on the labour ward until labour has started. Although these rules are gradually being relaxed in some NHS trusts, many women are experiencing large parts of their pregnancy and birth in isolation, reliant on the assistance or support of midwives and other staff. This is hard enough in itself but if something goes wrong, women are left with very little emotional support.  The 12-week dating scan is an important milestone, when many expectant mothers get to âseeâ their baby for the first time. But for some women, it is when they sadly discover they have miscarried. To not have a partner or person of support with them at such a vulnerable and upsetting moment is a frightening prospect for women in the early stages of pregnancy. From my observations in pregnancy groups and forums, the result of this is that many women are paying for additional private scans which allow the presence of partners. This is not an option for everyone: early private scans range in price from Â£40-80.  Of course, having the father of the baby present at the birth was not common during the war years. But the removal of the mother from familiar and comforting surroundings to birth in an unknown setting, often some distance away, resulted in a similar sense of isolation and reliance on strangers. When the evacuations first began, women were billeted with locals in the same manner as evacuated children, but this was so unpopular that maternity hostels were established.  The emotional toll of giving birth in a time of national emergency is the connection which unites these two groups of women across the decades. Living in uncertain times and facing a solitary pregnancy and birth, they are and were incredibly brave in the face of incredible upheaval and vulnerability.",https://theconversation.com/birth-at-a-time-of-national-emergency-from-the-second-world-war-to-coronavirus-140488,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,1dc6fbba7a7d9f5ced94b8efc04017b423da0156bbbb2f31ceff26cbe967b5b2,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

However, we know relatively little about the microplastics in our freshwater rivers, streams and lakes. We still donât know exactly where they come from, where they end up â and crucially â what damage they can cause if they get into food chains.  Until now, plastic fragmentation had largely been attributed to processes such as sunlight or wave action, which can take years or decades. But it turns out a tiny shrimp-like creature can do the same job much faster.  I am a researcher who specialises in microplastics in the environment. In my latest study, colleagues and I have shown that microplastics (plastic pieces smaller than 5mm) in freshwaters are being broken down into even smaller nanoplastics (smaller than one micrometre, at least five thousand times smaller in size) by a type of freshwater invertebrate animal, and that this may happen much faster than previously estimated. Our results, newly published in the Nature journal Scientific Reports, highlight the role of biological fragmentation of microplastics, which has been understudied so far.  The animal in question is a 2cm-long crustacean, the freshwater amphipod Gammarus duebeni. This specific species lives in Irish streams, but it belongs to a bigger group of invertebrates that are common in both freshwater and the oceans around the world. Our finding therefore has big consequences for how we understand the environmental fate of microplastics.  Alicia Mateos Cardenas , Author provided  Our first experiments had been carried out to understand the potential negative effects (if any) of microplastics in the amphipods. However, some surprising early results led me to run new experiments focused on gathering evidence to show that microplastics were being fragmented biologically â by G. duebeni themselves.  In order to find out about this, I exposed the amphipods in the laboratory to a certain type of microplastics that have a specific colour dye. I then dissected the digestive tracts of the amphipods and visualised them under a fluorescence microscope, which is able to track the dyed-microplastic in animal tissue.  We then concluded that Gammarus duebeni is able to fragment microplastics into different shapes and sizes, including nanoplastics, in less than four days.  We were able to track such fragmentation because the microplastics that we used were originally âmicrobeadsâ with a perfect spherical shape. Any plastic with irregular shapes therefore must have been fragmented by the animals, and nearly 66% of the microplastics found in the guts had indeed been fragmented in this way.  Remarkably, the proportion of smaller plastic fragments was highest when the amphipods were âpurgedâ in the lab in a clean environment with no plastics but with their food. This finding indicates that biological fragmentation could be closely related to the feeding process.  Alicia Mateos Cardenas , Author provided  We also ran some quality control checks, several side experiments to make sure that the plastic was indeed being fragmented by the amphipods and not some other source, and that we were accurately visualising the fluorescence particles.  Microplastics in the food chain  Why does this matter? We already know that microplastics can accumulate in the gut of seabirds and fish, and our current understanding is that the smaller nanoplastic particles could even penetrate cells and tissues where their effects could be much harder to predict.  Therefore the finding that such a common animal can rapidly produce vast numbers of nanoplastics is particularly worrying. Since the crustaceans we looked at are eaten by fish and birds, any nanoplastic fragments that they produce may also be entering the food chain.  For example, scientists at the University of Cardiff recently showed for the first time that microplastics had been transferred up the food chain in a river, from small invertebrates through to dippers, the only songbird that can swim underwater. They looked at dipper regurgitates and faecal pellets from both adults and chicks and found microplastics in all of them.  We still donât know exactly what effect this microplastic transfer will have on the birds, especially in the early stages of their lives. But our results on the biological fragmentation of microplastics will help us to understand the role that animals can have in determining the fate of plastics in our waters.",https://theconversation.com/microplastics-tiny-crustaceans-can-fragment-them-into-even-smaller-nanoplastics-143703,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,4fb978fcba87e41e1cbfcbd20bb7b2cac932672a3ac9c498342ec013e49b8bed,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

These days, as Celticâs manager, Neil Lennon is a much calmer, mellower figure who seems more comfortable in his own skin.  Crucially, heâs a man whoâs developed emotional intelligence in a profession where other managers refuse â or perhaps feel unable â to do the same. But as another highly competitive Premiership kicks off in Scotland, embracing emotional intelligence may be the smart move for managers seeking to motivate expensive players and propel their teams to success.  What is emotional intelligence (EI) and why does it matter in football? It can be understood as a personâs capacity to recognise and manage their own and othersâ emotions. Itâs what enables us to think rationally before acting, so that we find more logical solutions to problems and make better decisions when engaged in emotional activities, of which football is undoubtedly one.  This is why a managerâs lack of emotional intelligence or people skills â rather than poor tactics or ineffective training â can sometimes be more deserving of blame when things go wrong on the pitch. But there is hope for the emotionally challenged gaffer.  In a study that involved attending several months of EI training, sports coaches reported feeling more skilled in their use of adaptive strategies to regulate their emotions. They also attested to improved relationships and enhanced personal performance.  Turning over a new leaf  These results, alongside wider research, suggest that EI can be learned. For added inspiration, consider how the public actions of the ânewâ Neil Lennon in comparison with others (including his old self) illustrate some of the characteristics and value of EI in football management.  Near the beginning of Lennonâs second and current term as Celtic boss, the club suffered a shock defeat by Romanian club Cluj, sending them crashing out of the Champions League qualifiers. Lennon, while bitterly disappointed, made far more controlled comments about his teamâs errors than he did as interim manager when Celtic lost to Ross County in the 2009-10 Scottish Cup semi-final. Here, Lennon questioned playersâ character and even suggested that some should be sold.  At another point in the 2019-20 season, Celtic suffered a second surprise European loss, this time at the hands of FC Copenhagen in the Europa League final-32 knock-out phase. Lennon insisted that nobody would be made a scapegoat and praised his teamâs collective efforts over the course of a group-winning campaign.  By emphasising and acknowledging playersâ hard work, Lennon provided them with evidence of their success, seemingly in the hopes of promoting unity and minimising feelings of disappointment within the team. As a manager he also showed an understanding of how less pleasant emotions can be leveraged to produce positive results, when he asked players not to forget the loss completely so that it could motivate them to win their next match, which they did.  More emotional astuteness was revealed when Rangers beat Celtic to cut the gap at the top of the Scottish Premiership to two points with a game in hand going into the midway break in late 2019. Despite likely feeling under enormous pressure to deliver a record-equalling ninth consecutive league title, Lennon called for calm, in a reaction that demonstrated an awareness of the infectious nature of emotions (technically known as the emotional contagion effect).  Lennonâs positive emotional role-modelling surely helped his team bounce back from the upset and go undefeated for the rest of the season, finishing as champions 13 points ahead of a Rangers team that seemed to capitulate under pressure from fans â and perhaps, tellingly, their manager Steven Gerrard â following a string of poor results.  Smart managing  When we consider a managerâs ability to create an emotional atmosphere for players, an interesting parallel can be drawn between the sight of an apoplectic Lennon during a loss to Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 2011, and a dejected Gerrard during a loss to Hamilton Academical in 2020 at the end of what were runner-up seasons for both managers.  Does such a comparison present a lifeline for Gerrardâs ambitions to win trophies at Rangers and perhaps one day at Liverpool? As far as continued personal development (CPD) activities go, Gerrard could do worse than study the emotional brilliance of Liverpoolâs current boss, JÃ¼rgen Klopp, whose personal and relational skills were instrumental in the Reds recently returning to English top flight glory after a 30-year dry spell.  But is EI really that important for winning? After all, Lennon won five trophies in his first spell at Celtic despite his volatile nature. And Tottenham Hotspurâs manager, JosÃ© Mourinho, is one of the most explosive yet decorated managers of all time.  Still, the Portuguese managerâs troublesome habit for âlosing the dressing roomâ prompts admiration for Lennonâs current behaviour, similar to that of Klopp when his team lost the Champions League final in 2018. Both have the ability to offer a potential solution for when things donât go exactly as planned.  These days football managers are fired quickly if they donât produce results, and have to deal with multi-million pound players who are becoming increasingly powerful. So erratic and unempathetic behaviour in the hot seat has never been more risky.  Gone might be the days of successful managers regularly giving players the âhairdryer treatmentâ made famous by the legendary former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. A gentler, more calculating and emotionally controlled approach may now be required.  Lennon is still flawed at times, as his recent spurning of a player for getting injured proves, but these days he thinks as much as he feels, making him a more effective leader. Anyone wishing to develop emotional intelligence would do well to heed the advice Lennon wishes he could have given his younger self: âCalm down. You canât do everything yourself. Take a step back and smell the roses.â",https://theconversation.com/celtics-neil-lennon-how-a-hothead-player-found-emotional-intelligence-as-a-manager-140570,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,b9113ce5d1b64602716a8b027dc25e1b9f333fa120413449a4bb32f47edb54a9,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:50.599671,2020-07-31T14:15:11Z,Coronavirus vaccine: lessons from the 19th-century smallpox anti-vaxxer movement,"There is hope a coronavirus vaccine might be ready by the end of the year. But for it to eliminate COVID-19 a critical mass of people must be vaccinated. And if the protective benefits of a COVID-19 vaccine fall off rapidly (as seems to happen with naturally acquired antibodies) maintaining immunity will require multiple vaccinations. So unless people keep renewing their jabs, the critical mass will decline quickly.  How will politicians ensure critical mass and renewal? For UK prime minister Boris Johnson (who labels those who oppose vaccination as ânutsâ) and others, vaccination is a matter of duty. There is a logical case (we know people who have died or suffered badly from COVID-19) and a moral case (to protect others if not yourself).  Yet anti-vaccination sentiment focused on the rights of citizens not to act is clear. A recent poll of 2,000 people across the UK found that 14% would refuse to take a vaccine.  The rights of citizens not to act mean that compulsory vaccination cannot be (and has not been) ruled out. The history of other vaccination programmes, particularly the first truly national campaign against smallpox, shows how difficult the balancing of rights and duties will be.  A disappearing act  The 19th-century invention of vaccination created a new national imperative for the UK to combat endemic smallpox. The risk of dying from smallpox for those who contracted it was substantially higher than that for COVID-19 today. Survivors gained immunity but often at the cost of physical scarring and long-term health problems.  Vaccination and subsequent elimination should have been a no-brainer. Yet local and regional outbreaks persisted across the 19th century.  Governments of this period assumed (sometimes incorrectly) that the middle-classes would realise the value of vaccination. The poor and marginal were different. For them, mass compulsory vaccination awaited.  The result was an explosive atmosphere. Rumours of deaths after vaccination and of the rounding up of the poor like animals generated a sustained popular backlash, with some organising under the umbrella of the National Anti-Vaccination League.  Yet even after vaccination became compulsory in 1853, there were many ways in which, by accident or design, ordinary people citizens avoided the jab. Some people simply disappeared from the records or failed to appear when asked. Those most prone to doing so (those in crowded households or immigrants, for example) were also the groups most susceptible to disease.  Census data consistently undercounts the national population. Undercounting in the 1800s may have missed around 10% of some communities. Even for the 2011 census, around 6.1% of the population is believed to have been missed. Achieving vaccination critical mass is difficult where you do not know the true size of the mass and the most vulnerable are the least detectable.  The poor also âclogged upâ the vaccination system. Sometimes they agreed to participate and then did not turn up, a common feature for systems of compulsion where there is no ultimate sanction. On other occasions, as for instance at Keighley in 1882, people would supplement this activity with the sending of anonymous hate mail in an attempt to disrupt the work of local vaccinators.  Fight for their rights  Taking advantage of local tensions was also a useful avoidance technique. âSmallpox riotsâ in the face of attempts at crude compulsion were frequent and sustained.  Sometimes organised by local agitators, and sometimes spurred on by instances of children dying after vaccination, such unrest varied on a spectrum from small and localised to community-wide and sustained. Riots at Ipswich, Henley, Leicester and Newcastle were particularly notable.  Nor should we forget that vaccination opponents spread rumours about and caricatured vaccines and vaccinators, undermining the credibility of the system in the public imagination. These included one cartoon from the 1880s in which helpless children are shovelled into the mouth of a diseased cow while, at the other end, a doctor portrayed as the devil incarnate shovels dead children excreted by the cow into a cart bound for mass graves.  In July 2020 public figures stand accused of using Twitter to the same effect for COVID-19 vaccination.  Most forcefully, while politicians used the law in order to force vaccination, the law could also be turned against them. Penalties against parents for failing to vaccinate children, introduced in 1853 and strengthened in 1867, were routinely ignored by courts. Compulsory child vaccination was removed in 1898 and the freedom to refuse introduced.  Long-standing opposition to vaccination by some scientists as well as ordinary people crystallised in 1885 with a huge demonstration at Leicester (ironically the recent focus of a British local lockdown). This and ongoing smaller protests across the country forced the government to introduce a Royal Commission to reflect on the whole question of compulsion. The verdict ultimately fell on the side of the rights of the individual.  It is not hard to imagine the 2021 human rights case in which a court must decide on the balance of the legal and collective duty of citizens to get vaccinated against COVID-19 nd the individual right to choose.  Our political and medical elites believe that people will accept moral responsibility: âget vaccinatedâ. Yet little thought has gone into how a mass vaccination programme works.  We will see some of the lessons of 20th-century vaccination schemes repeated, with public information campaigns and elements of coercion via vaccination programmes in schools and care homes. Nonetheless, the lack of serious credence given to anti-vaccination ânutsâ and the resistance that a vaccination programme may generate feels oh so 19th-century.",https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-vaccine-lessons-from-the-19th-century-smallpox-anti-vaxxer-movement-143375,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,843a6d05c8c29b41375c492452827e92b2189fcd1523c7beafe442f82931543c,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:50.769685,2020-07-31T13:03:28Z,Four reasons the UK governmentâs obesity strategy may not work for everyone,"COVID-19 has affected a disproportionate number of people with obesity in the UK. As such, the government has seen the pandemic as a âwake-up callâ to the health risks of living with obesity. They have recently announced a long overdue strategy to tackle obesity in Britain.  Some of the proposals aimed at significantly reducing obesity rates, include:  banning TV and online advertising of foods high in fat, sugar, or salt before 9pm  calorie labelling on menus in restaurants and takeaways, alongside consulting on alcohol calorie labelling and front-of-pack âtraffic lightâ labelling â where âgreenâ products are considered more nutritious, and âredâ products less  expansion of the NHSâs weight management service (including apps and online tools)  incentives for GPs to support patients with obesity in their weight loss, and prescribe exercise and social activities.  However, the proposals are not without criticism, and some feel the governmentâs plans arenât enough to end obesity. And though many of the proposed interventions are thoroughly researched, not all methods will be effective for everyone. Here are four key problems with the strategy.  1) It doesnât target every driver of obesity  Multiple factors combine to influence body weight. Our psychology and biology, and what motivates us to eat or be physically active, all interrelate with societal-level food supply, social influence (such as food marketing), and our physical activity environment (such as how walkable and connected a community is, and how much recreational space it has available).  One of the governmentâs biggest targets is to promote increased physical activity among the population. This includes investment into active transport infrastructure to increase physical activity, and incentives for GPs to prescribe exercise or other social activities.  Research shows physical activity is higher in neighbourhoods with more parks and public transport and steps to promote more physical activity should be applauded. But they donât fully recognise the complexity of obesity.  Not everyone will want, choose, or be motivated to be active in the same way as others. Support in changing behaviour, and making access to many types of physical activity affordable will be key to getting the nation moving.  2) Access to healthier foods is key  The government has also announced aims to promote healthy eating. Some of the strategies include banning junk food advertising on TV before 9pm and ending offers on unhealthy foods.  However, not all these strategies have been shown to work. Government research in 2019 even calculated a pre-watershed junk food advert ban would only reduce the average daily calorie intake by about 1.7 calories. Instead, improving access to healthier, affordable foods will be extremely important for bringing wider change.  Read more: Children are far from protected from junk food ads â especially on social media  Increasing offers on fruits and vegetables, and ending âbuy-one-get-one-freeâ offers on unhealthy foods in stores are likely to help. However, the continued prevalence of fast food outlets in some areas, particularly deprived ones, may continue to undermine access to healthier alternatives for many people.  Research has shown that access to unhealthy food options, which tend to be cheaper and may be perceived as better tasting, increases intake of them. For this reason, reducing access to unhealthy food options and improving access to healthier options need to be considered together. Doing so will lead to better eating habits and reduced obesity risk.  3) Calorie labelling doesnât necessarily work  The government pledge to put calorie labels on both alcohol and in restaurants is long overdue. We know nutritional information can help people when making food and drink choices, making them feel more informed.  However, this wonât help everyone restrict intake of unhealthy foods. According to the theory of planned behaviour, consumer behaviours are ultimately dictated by a combination of attitude, social norms (what everyone around you does), and whether someone feels theyâre capable of changing. So having nutritional information wonât necessarily override these other factors.  Understanding nutritional information also requires both literacy and numeracy skills, which could inadvertently widen the health gap, as those who have difficulty interpreting such information are more likely to come from more deprived backgrounds.  Research on food product calorie labelling and âtraffic lightâ systems has shown that while consumers may look at such labels, they donât necessarily process this information further. In some cases, these labels have little effect on calorie consumption or product choice.  Though this strategy aims to empower consumers by providing key information, this isnât enough. Help in changing behaviour (such as cognitive behavioural therapy), and support in understanding food labels need to be implemented as well to drive healthier food choices.  4) Weight management is not one-size-fits-all  Expanding 12-week weight management services across the NHS may help some. But as the factors driving weight gain and loss are unique to each person, a one-size-fits-all approach may not work for everyone.  Research shows that 12-month (or longer) tailored programmes are more effective than shorter, general weight-management services in helping people who are overweight or obese lose and maintain weight. And while weight management services can be successful, multicomponent services â which give a person choice of the interventions they will use â are recommended.  However, primary care staff are overburdened already. Many GPs also often feel reluctant to discuss weight management with their patients so as not to ruin their relationships. Given these factors, such discussions or help may not even be provided despite the proposed initiatives.  Importantly, weight management programmes should be delivered and supported by specialist staff, such as registered nutritionists and dietitians. This will also alleviate pressure on primary health care providers.  The governmentâs strategy promises to realise a range of initiatives that have long been proposed, trialled and evaluated by health professionals and researchers. But research shows thereâs a need to tackle societal factors that favour obesity alongside providing individual support. These proposals are a small step towards better weight management in the UK â but targeted and tailored solutions for each person will work best.",https://theconversation.com/four-reasons-the-uk-governments-obesity-strategy-may-not-work-for-everyone-143695,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,4d854c657248f39b60adf118c9bda1bb047c850e9c911b86a4281f48283f5267,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

But it has also shown how measures that benefit health (lockdowns) can be seen as bad economic prosperity. A similar paradox is at the heart of promoting better diets.  Poor diet is the worldâs leading cause of ill-health. Malnutrition â from undernutrition to obesity â affects at least one-third of the global population. Itâs an issue of inequality, too: diet-related challenges disproportionately affect poorer people, making the economic challenge even greater.  Poor nutrition also costs businesses dearly. A recent report by research institute Chatham House estimates that businesses around the world lose as much as US$38 billion (Â£29 billion) a year from undernutrition and obesity among their workforce. Nevertheless, when governments attempt to take unhealthy foods out of the spotlight and place more nutritious foods centre stage, they typically rub up against economic arguments that any regulation will hurt business.  COVID-19 has shown itâs time to change. Obesity, diabetes and other chronic conditions associated with unhealthy diets increase the risk of complications from the virus (a point not lost on UK prime minister Boris Johnson, who had his own battle with the virus).  There are also predictions that the pandemic will lead to a crisis of undernutrition. As discussions about how to renew the global economy â and rethink the economic system â are heating up, food must be part of our thinking.  This five-point plan could do the work of resetting the food economy over the short term, allowing it to both flourish and nourish over the long term.  1. Financing for healthy food  Healthier food costs more. Investment is needed all the way along the food-value chain to make a healthy diet more affordable for the 3 billion people around the world who cannot afford one.  Public spending on agriculture â like subsidies for fertilisers, payments direct to farmers and plant breeding programmes, as well as policies to attract private sector investment â tends to favour crops like maize, palm oil, rice and soybeans.  These crops dominate the unhealthy food industry and leave children in low-income countries undernourished. This investment could be reallocated to diversifying and building supply chains for more nutritious foods like fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains.  Investment is needed in local food supply chains too, connecting smaller and more sustainable producers of nutritious foods to consumers who need them most. E-commerce initiatives are growing in the wake of COVID-19 in many lower income countries and could be built on.  Food hubs that bring food from producers to commercial customers or direct to consumers are also growing. This would support local food economies in countries rich and poor.  Innovative financing is a vital part of the picture. For example, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, an organisation working to improve the consumption of nutritious foods, has a programme that encourages investment in nutritious food businesses in low- and middle-income countries. These are small- and medium-sized businesses that play an important role in creating jobs and boosting regional economies.  In London, the Good Food Fund is a new Â£1.8 million business accelerator and venture fund designed to back SMEs and start-ups to produce healthier snacks for kids.  2. Make junk food less attractive  Itâs relatively easy to make money by selling cheap snacks to kids and adults alike. Companies compete with each other to tempt consumers everywhere, from Dakar to Dublin. A small amount of regulation would incentivise healthy, rather than unhealthy, competition.  The fact that during lockdown some large corporations have been vying for greater market share for their cookies, pizzas and burgers shows that as long as businesses have the incentive to promote unhealthy products, they will continue to do so.  In Chile, for example, the government introduced tough, comprehensive regulations forcing food manufacturers to clearly label and market their products with how healthy (or unhealthy) they are. This enabled innovators to compete with the junk food industry and appeal to the health conscious. Similarly, taxes on sugary drinks in many countries has incentivised the industry to produce healthier products.  3. Profit with purpose  Another way to get food businesses to sell healthier products is through corporate governance mechanisms. Instead of focusing on shareholder profits, food companies could establish diet-related health as a core purpose.  Here, there is ample scope to join the growing ranks of âB corporationsâ. These are businesses that emphasise âsocial and environmental performanceâ alongside shareholder value. This could easily include health as a metric for food businesses.  4. Redefining success  A new package of healthy metrics is needed to define what success looks like for food businesses large and small. The Access to Nutrition Index, for instance, scores global food companies on how well they are addressing obesity and diet-related disease. In the UK, the Food Foundation has proposed metrics for investors to assess how well businesses are managing the risks and opportunities in the transition towards healthier food.  5. Public sector leading the way  Scores of cities around the world already have public procurement standards that ensure the millions of meals they serve daily in schools, nurseries, hospitals and prisons are healthy, while also providing stable markets to support vulnerable parts of the economy.  In âhomegrown school feedingâ and âfarm-to-schoolâ programmes, for example, public budgets are used to purchase healthy food from smaller, family, farmers while ensuring kids are well fed. Evidence from Nepal and the United States shows that if designed well, these programmes work.  Implementing this five-point plan will have its challenges. But every element has been tried and tested already. Itâs all doable. The task now is to implement them as a package to ensure the different elements are in place to repurpose the food economy â and indeed reform the global economy â for better, healthier eating.  The coronavirus has highlighted that the public is eager to see courageous leadership. Now is the time to step up and ensure we have an economy that is both nourishing and flourishing.",https://theconversation.com/five-ways-to-reboot-the-global-food-economy-to-make-it-healthier-for-all-143704,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,d363efff28163de911a37e95d605cb130b640f2542a023b626001943c9e85345,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

This is despite the existence of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, the Tyndall National Institute and the Pic Tyndall summit on the Matterhorn in the Alps. There are even several Mount Tyndalls, Tyndall glaciers and Tyndall craters on the Moon and Mars.  From that, you could surmise that he was both a significant scientist and a notable mountaineer. Yet, due to unfortunate circumstances, he is no household name.  In 1859, Tyndall showed that gases including carbon dioxide and water vapour can absorb heat. His heat source was not the Sun, but radiation from a copper cube containing boiling water. In modern terms, this was infrared radiation â just like that emanating from the Earthâs surface.  Previous work had shown that the Earthâs temperature was higher than expected, which was put down to the atmosphere acting as an insulator. But no-one knew the explanation for what we now call the greenhouse effect â gases in the atmosphere trapping heat.  What Tyndall did was to discover and explain this mechanism. He wrote: âThus the atmosphere admits of the entrance of the solar heat; but checks its exit, and the result is a tendency to accumulate heat at the surface of the planet.â  He realised that any change in the amount of water vapour or carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could change the climate. His work therefore set a foundation for our understanding of climate change and meteorology.  Tyndall was not, however, the first to make the climate link. That prize goes to the American Eunice Foote, who showed in 1856 using sunlight that carbon dioxide could absorb heat. She suggested that an increase in carbon dioxide would result in a warmer planet.  Research suggests Tyndall was unaware of her work. He would no doubt have been surprised to find that an amateur woman had beaten him to a general demonstration of the absorption of heat by carbon dioxide. To his discredit, he did not believe that women possessed the same creative abilities in science as men.  US EPA  Tyndall made many other discoveries in disparate fields of physics and biology. He made his initial reputation in the obscure topic of diamagnetism, the weak repulsion of substances by a magnet. That brought him to the notice of influential people such as physicist Michael Faraday.  Within a few years he was a fellow the Royal Society, Britainâs most prestigious scientific body, and professor of natural philosophy at the Royal Institution, where he remained for the rest of his scientific career.  Soon he was at work on understanding glacier structure and motion. After that came the work on the absorption of heat by gases, and then the action of light in causing chemical changes. In the process Tyndall explained why the sky is blue â blue light is scattered more by gases in the sky than other colours because of its short wavelength.  He also discovered âTyndallisationâ â a bacteriological technique of sterilisation â when undertaking experiments alongside French biologist Louis Pasteur to support the theory that germs can cause disease. That line of research led to the invention of a respirator for firefighters, though Tyndall never took out a patent. He committed himself to fundamental research, confident that others would generate useful applications.  Science versus religion  As a public intellectual, Tyndallâs was one of the loudest voices advocating a scientific explanation for the natural world and for life itself, a scientific naturalism. In this, religion and theology had no place. He gave the starkest statement of this position in his famous, indeed notorious, Belfast Address, in 1874.  In the Ulster Hall, he thundered:  We claim, and we shall wrest from theology, the entire domain of cosmological theory. All schemes and systems which thus infringe upon the domain of science must, insofar as they do this, submit to its control, and relinquish all thought of controlling it.  But he was never one to belittle the role of religion. Science, for him, provided reliable knowledge of the world. Religion met peopleâs emotional needs, a role he thought might eventually to be replaced by poetry.  Representing the past  Tyndall didnât marry until he was in his 50s, but his beloved Louisa killed him by accident in 1893 â giving him an overdose of the wrong medicine in the dark. She then gathered huge amounts of material to write his biography, but died 47 years later with it uncompleted.  Her drafts, as well as Tydnallâs diaries, laboratory notebooks and thousands of letters, are held at the Royal Institution in London. All his correspondence is currently being published by the Tyndall Correspondence Project. I was able to use the material when writing my biography The Ascent of John Tyndall, just released in paperback for his birthday.  Louisaâs failure to write a biography is part of the reason he is not better known, but he also had the misfortune to die on the cusp of revolutionary discoveries in physics such as quantum theory and relativity. In a sense, he represented the past.  But today, climate research is more important and pressing than ever â and scientists are making huge strides. I am sure Tyndall would be gratified to find that his foundational work had proved so important.  In his time, however, few people made the connection between the burning of fossil fuels and possible global warming. Tyndall was more worried that Britain would run out of coal and be unable to compete economically with America, given its vaster supplies. One imagines though that, as a scientist, he would be convinced by the current evidence.  Climate science is now the future rather than the past, and it is therefore time to recognise and reinstate Tyndall as a major Irish scientist, mountaineer and public intellectual.",https://theconversation.com/john-tyndall-the-forgotten-co-founder-of-climate-science-143499,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,5ba4ae8e824e25c37ee947988c3f76806a1fdb862ce8fc27659a806516955e89,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:52.459269,2020-07-31T10:03:08Z,Sea level rise: three visions of a future summer holiday at the coast,"The COVID-19 pandemic will ensure summer 2020 is a washout for most. With international travel restrictions limiting holidays abroad, many people in the UK have opted to stay somewhere closer to home. As a result, there have been remarkable increases in the number of visitors to beaches across the UK. Thousands flocked to a beach in Bournemouth on a single day in June, causing the local council to declare a major incident.  But far greater disruptions to our summer holidays lie ahead. About half of all tourism takes place in coastal areas, but with global warming set to raise sea levels by somewhere around two metres over the next 80 years, how will our relationship with the coast change?  Will we commemorate the old coastal boundaries with forlorn sojourns above the sunken land? Will we recreate the beach in the heart of our cities? Or will we preserve the drowned coast as a nature reserve â a quiet memorial to what was lost?  We imagined three different versions of what a beach holiday might look like as climate change eclipses the coastline we once knew.  1. Floating in place  Sea level rise may seem a distant threat, but resorts and other tourism operators are already considering how they can stay near the coast and operate above the water. On the Caribbean island of Barbuda, resort huts have been built on stilts.  The aim is to keep tourism viable in the same place it has thrived for decades, while minimising damage from higher water levels.  Seasteading is one answer to this conundrum. The idea to build settlements on platforms at sea originated with the hope of creating more sustainable and equal societies away from land. The technology is still being developed, while researchers consider the engineering, legal and business implications.  New research suggests that coastal flooding could threaten up to 20% of global GDP by 2100, with much of it tied to the tourism industry. Tourism could instead become a new source of income for seasteads. Given the dwindling coastal space for tourists, creating new spaces out at sea might be a way to meet the problem of sea level rise head on.  2. Bringing the beach to you  The urban beach is a concept thatâs growing in popularity worldwide. It involves creating sandy areas in towns and cities by importing sand onto concrete. There may also be artificial pools and fairground rides. Each one has different features. There are family-friendly options, and those catered to adults, with cocktail bars or restaurants.  The opportunities for hedonism are still there, but instead of travelling miles to enjoy it, itâs right on your doorstep. Less travel means less carbon emissions, and urban beaches might help ease pressure on the real coast.  Perhaps the most famous urban beach is the Paris Plage. Since its opening in 2002, Parisians and summer tourists have been able to lounge under palm trees on the banks of the river Seine. It cost over two million Euros to create and has since been extended due to its popularity.  The Nottingham Riviera is an attempt to recreate this success in the UK. The landlocked beach in the middle of the city has sand and water, amusement arcades and beach bars.  The urban beach is becoming an industry in itself, with companies specialising in fake beaches that can be built as seasonal fixtures or permanent areas. If reaching the coast becomes too arduous in the future, these examples could provide everything needed for a seaside experience without the sea.  3. Rewilding the coast  Perhaps the most pragmatic solution is to accept nature taking its course and relinquish control as rising seas reshape the terrain. Allowing the new coastline to rewild could create millions of acres of new wetlands â habitats that are very good at storing carbon and that have deteriorated by about 50% since 1900.  Examples from Hong Kong, Spain, and Wallasea Island in the UK demonstrate how turning heavily managed coastal areas into new habitats can create new opportunities for wildlife and people.  Read more: Rising seas: to keep humans safe, let nature shape the coast  So does the Mexican island, Mayakoba. Its unique mangrove forests were damaged and polluted by the building of numerous hotel chains on the seafront, but today, only 10% of these hotels remain on the coast.  The local community abandoned their high-density model of tourism and protected the dunes and mangroves, which were being eroded by excessive development. New canal networks were dug to create an estuary, attracting birds and amphibians. This new wetland was designated as a nature reserve and visitors arrived to enjoy a new kind of tourist experience.  Visitor capacity and beach activities were reduced to ensure sensitive coastal environments could remain protected. But allowing the sea back into reclaimed coastal territory allowed a more sustainable model of tourism to flourish â one which could be replicated elsewhere as sea levels rise.  But before that can happen, our views of the coast must change. Humans once saw land and sea as a continuation of one another, rather than two discrete entities. Reviving this concept could allow us to navigate a future in which once certain borders have blurred beyond recognition.",https://theconversation.com/sea-level-rise-three-visions-of-a-future-summer-holiday-at-the-coast-139939,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,e31a13558be03049802aa58cddbdb6800dfc46a7a1d287ea4cae0a42411c2cbe,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:53.714088,2020-07-31T09:09:11Z,Face mask rules: do they really violate personal liberty?,"Several hundred people assembled in Londonâs Hyde Park in July 2020 to protest rules making face masks mandatory in shops and supermarkets to help control the spread of COVID-19. This was not an isolated event. Similar protests have occurred in many places around the world in reaction to the prospect of âmask mandatesâ â especially in the United States.  These protesters are not without allies. âAnti-maskersâ have elicited support from prominent figures on the political right in the UK and America: Peter Hitchens of the Daily Mail has called them âmuzzlesâ; Michael Savage, a prominent talk radio host, called masks a âmark of submissionâ; to say nothing of President Donald Trumpâs refusal to wear a face mask in public and his dismissal of them as âpolitically correctâ (until his abysmal approval ratings compelled him to awkwardly soften his position).  Why do mask mandates elicit such anger?  Setting aside the conspiracy theories and disinformation that seem to prevade these protests, the participants are joined by a fierce attachment to individual liberty. They believe mask mandates sacrifice individual liberty to a collectivist notion a âgreater goodâ.  It is easy to understand why: mask mandates use the coercive power of the state to require a person to do something that they would otherwise not choose to do. And it seems to follow that a personâs liberty is compromised by such interference.  The conception of âfreedom as non-interferenceâ that underpins the anti-mask movement has the virtue of simplicity. It allows us to apply an easy metric to test our freedom: if our choices are interfered with, then we are less free.  But if this is correct it is unclear why wearing a mask is so troubling given the widespread âinterferenceâ in our other choices. Surely, the requirement that you have to cover any part of your body is a far graver violation of individual liberty than being compelled to wear a small face covering during a pandemic? It may be that the anti-mask movement is the spear tip of a global militant nudism trend, but that doesnât seem particularly plausible (or desirable).  What is freedom?  The problem is that the idea of liberty as non-interference often runs up against common sense. For example, most people do not feel savagely oppressed by having to drive on one side of the road, by bans on public nudity or by laws against murder. They interfere with our choices, but they donât seem to make us less free. Maybe we need a different formulation of freedom.  Shutterstock  You are free when you are protected not against simple interference, but against arbitrary interference.  As the philosopher Philip Pettit notes, this makes liberty a more complex idea, but one better suited to our social reality. It is more vulnerable because it only requires the potential for interference to be compromised, but it also makes it more robust because if the interference is not arbitrary then it is not a violation of liberty even if our actions are constrained.  This can be illustrated by contrasting the slave with the citizen. All the choices of a slave are predicated on their masterâs permission. This is the case even if they have a kind or lazy owner who never actually interferes in their choices. The possibility of being âsold down the riverâ remains and being under such power is irreconcilable with freedom.  In contrast a citizen may be subject to significant interference from the state, but it does not diminish their liberty if the laws are not arbitrary. This is true if several conditions exist: the laws need to be publicly known so that you can ensure compliance; they need to be impartially enforced so that no one is above the law; they need to be contestable in courts of law and the public square; and they need to be subjected to invigilation by those they affect, usually through democratic accountability.  A slave has to live in a state of perpetual uncertainty, a citizen knows where they stand.  This account of freedom depends on the procedural mechanisms which prevent the power of the state being chained to the private will of a single person or group. If âmask mandatesâ meet these procedural requirements, then they cannot be said to violate the personal liberty of individuals even if they restrict what they can and cannot do.  Letâs test whether mask mandates meet these requirements. The rules are publicly known and they seem to be being impartially enforced, though there is an open question about whether COVID-19 restrictions have been applied unfairly to people of colour.  If these mandates violate a citizenâs rights, then they are free to bring a legal challenge and we know they can protest against them (so long as the protests comply with regulations). Finally, these rules are the product of democratically elected governments subject to judicial oversight and political opposition. They therefore cannot be called arbitrary.  The anti-maskers are right that the state ought to be resisted when it tries to dominate its citizens and violate their basic rights, but instead of worrying about masks, they ought to be more concerned with instances of unidentifiable government agents firing tear gas into peaceful demonstrators or detaining people for an indeterminate amount of time under the nebulous mandate of protecting monuments or national security. These are the things that turn citizens into slaves.",https://theconversation.com/face-mask-rules-do-they-really-violate-personal-liberty-143634,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,e745f47f72d06e560607c4be5edfe3966a00221883057ac13bb9c126bc838b9c,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:53.885137,2020-07-30T15:03:08Z,"Thermal cameras arenât perfect, but they can help control the coronavirus pandemic","In response to the coronavirus pandemic, the world has rushed to deploy infrared thermal imaging cameras (also known as infrared radiometers) to measure peopleâs temperature and the technology has become big business.  Since the pandemic began, thermal cameras have been deployed in areas of high-density foot traffic such as airports, shopping centres, nursing homes, factories, office buildings, schools, even hairdressers. This is raising questions about their safety and accuracy.  And while the accuracy of these devices depends on how they are used, we can say for certain that the technology poses no harm to people and is perfectly safe.  How do thermal cameras work?  Infrared thermal imaging cameras measure radiated energy from an object surface, such as the human skin, without any need to touch that surface. Different temperatures are shown as different colours on a thermogram, which can change colour, for example, at the threshold for a fever (38â).  This idea goes back to 1800, when William Herschel, the Royal Astronomer, who was already famous for discovering the planet Uranus, first described the existence of infrared radiation. He passed sunlight through a glass prism and measured the temperature of each rainbow colour with different thermometers. He noticed a higher temperature in a dark area and called this âradiant heatâ: we now call this infrared radiation.  Early thermal imagers became available around 1959 and were used initially to measure the increased heat over arthritic hips. Other medical applications have included Raynaudâs phenomenon (which affects blood circulation), diabetes symptoms and melanoma, however screening for fever has become its most common clinical use today.  Pantelis Saitas/EPA  In the past, fevers were diagnosed using mercury thermometers, which for safety reasons have been replaced by infrared devices that measure tympanic (ear drum) temperature. However, these require close contact with the person, which is not ideal in screening for potential cases of coronavirus.  Todayâs infrared cameras are extremely reliable with very few moving parts, are simple to operate, but to be accurate it is vital the user targets the correct area of the face. In the 2009 Swine Flu pandemic, the forehead was the target area used, and this gave misleading results.  The latest update from the thermographs from the International Organization for Standardization confirms the region that gives the most stable results is near the inner canthi (tear duct) because it is located directly over a major artery. If this area is one or more degrees higher than the baseline average (37â), there is a high probability that the person has a fever, which should then be verified in the usual way with a traditional infrared tympanic thermometer.  In the image below, we can see the difference between how a child without a fever (on the left) shows up on a thermal camera compared a child who has a fever (on the right), when the camera is targeted on the tear ducts.  The limitations of thermal cameras  Fever is an important sign of infection with COVID-19 but will not always be present. An infectious person in the early stages of the disease may have no symptoms at all, or they may have some symptoms but no fever.  This is why the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK warned that temperature screening cannot be relied upon for detecting cases of COVID-19.  Still, there is clinical evidence to support the use of thermal cameras for fever screening. The reality is that with the right thermal imaging camera, the right lens and following the correct guidelines and standards, it can be effective as a screening tool.  How to get the best results  To maximise the chances of success, thermal cameras should be positioned close to and level with the eyes, to capture a cluster of image pixels from near the tear ducts.  The type of camera and lens is extremely important â an infrared radiometer with at least 320 x 240 pixels is considered a minimum requirement with a standard lens between 20-24Â°. Ideally, the face should occupy at least 75% of the image and so a distance between the person being scanned and the camera of 70-120cm is recommended to achieve this.  If these distances are extended, it will result in a drop in temperature. You can see the difference in temperature of the same person at 600cm results in a drop of 1.6â.  Roderick Thomas , Author provided (No reuse)  Regular calibration of the camera and recording of the environmental temperature on the image is crucial, because variation in the room temperature and humidity will also affect the result. Draughts and direct sunlight can also cause difficulties and should be avoided.  Most important to know, for those who are worried about safety, is that infrared cameras, like any other cameras, capture energy emitted from the body and do not generate any radiation themselves. So there is no risk from them.  However, although proper and careful use will minimise false negative and positive results, these problems will occur, and so it is important that the limitations of this technology for screening are understood and it is used in conjunction with other measures to limit the spread of coronavirus. If deployed alongside social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing, thermal cameras can still be part of our arsenal in the fight to control this disease.",https://theconversation.com/thermal-cameras-arent-perfect-but-they-can-help-control-the-coronavirus-pandemic-141701,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,fd6886dc80501af89577e03921436291145cda20bba806b15517c85352aeaf30,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:54.105669,2020-07-30T13:08:53Z,"Wellbeing levels fell during the pandemic but improved under lockdown, data analysis shows","Lockdowns are seemingly vital for controlling COVID-19. Early evidence suggests they have a big effect on preventing deaths. But if weâre to keep using them, we also need to know their broader impacts. Many people are worried about lockdowns also having a negative effect on mental health.  Indeed, most assessments have found that they do. But these studies usually canât distinguish between the effects of the pandemic and of lockdowns specifically. This is because they often only compare peopleâs mental states from before the pandemic and after lockdowns were introduced. A decline in wellbeing might be a response to the overall pandemic.  To better judge the impact of lockdowns on wellbeing, we need to isolate the critical period after the pandemic started but before lockdowns were launched, and compare how people felt at this point with how they felt during lockdown.  So, we conducted research using data from YouGovâs UK weekly mood tracker and Google Trends to do this. Following a rise in negative emotions at the start of the pandemic, our working paper found that wellbeing improved once lockdowns began â though not consistently for all social groups.  Separating lockdowns from the pandemic  From June 2019 to June 2020, YouGov surveyed a nationally representative sample of around 2,000 respondents each week across Great Britain. It asked them to report on 12 mood states: happiness, contentment, inspiration, optimism, energy levels, sadness, apathy, stress, boredom, frustration, loneliness and fear.  Data from the survey suggests that the pandemic had a strong negative effect on peopleâs mood, but that this quickly returned to baseline after the introduction of lockdown. Boredom, loneliness, frustration and apathy increased with the introduction of lockdown, but so did happiness, optimism, contentment and even inspiration. Meanwhile, sadness, fear and stress all fell.  Unfortunately, overall life satisfaction questions were only introduced into the mood tracker in April 2020. So, to consider how the pandemic and lockdown affected peopleâs general wellbeing, we had to attribute scores to respondents for the period prior to April based on their mood data (we calculated the scores using a statistical technique called regression).  While far from ideal, the results from this analysis â depicted in the figure below â suggest that life satisfaction similarly fell with the arrival of the pandemic and rebounded after lockdown began.  Author provided  Lockdowns, while demanding, are a decisive and effective government response. So itâs perhaps not surprising that, with the threat of COVID-19 having rapidly accelerated in March, their introduction would to some extent lessen peopleâs concerns.  Using Google to compare countries  We then turned to Google search data in order to look at other countries. We wanted to see how peopleâs feelings of negative emotions â whatâs known as ânegative affectâ â may have changed over time.  Google Trends shows the relative popularity of specific Google search terms on a week-by-week basis. We focused on the period June 2019 to June 2020, restricting our analysis to English-speaking countries â namely the UK, New Zealand, Australia, India, South Africa, Ireland, the USA and Canada.  We then created a measure of negative affect by looking at the combined popularity of the following terms: âpsychological stressâ, âboredomâ, âfrustrationâ, âsadnessâ, âfearâ and âapathyâ.  As shown in the following figure, the trend of negative affect seen in UK Google searches closely matches the trend seen in the YouGov mood survey.  Author provided  And the Google data shows similar trends across other English-speaking nations. This measure of negative affect rose sharply with the outbreak of the pandemic, then began to fall as lockdowns were implemented.  Author provided  Statistical analysis of these trends in the Google data shows that, on average, negative affect fell by 17% in the one-month period immediately after various lockdowns were introduced. Again, given that lockdowns tended to begin when uncertainty, new COVID-19 cases and daily deaths were at their peak, itâs perhaps not surprising that we see this effect.  Some social groups were affected more than others  Finally, we also used the YouGov data to look at how the pandemic and lockdown affected the wellbeing of different groups of people in Great Britain. We found that about half of the total effect of the pandemic and lockdown is sociotropic, meaning that it affected everyone similarly.  Of the remaining half, we found acute negative effects on the wellbeing of the elderly, professionals, those living alone and women.  The wellbeing of elderly people had already fallen prior to lockdown beginning, most likely because of the greater threat posed to older age groups by COVID-19. Increases in social isolation, loneliness and boredom post lockdown may then have disproportionately affected older groups, as well as people living alone.  For small business owners and staff, economic insecurities related to retail closures and employee furloughs may have had a disproportionate impact on wellbeing.  And itâs clear that lockdown entailed particular hardship for women, often because of additional childcare and home schooling responsibilities not being shared equally.  But we also found positive effects for low socioeconomic status (SES) individuals, especially men. We suspect that this reflects the income support made available to these individuals. The following figure shows how life satisfaction rose among three low SES groups (skilled and unskilled manual labourers and the underemployed) during the lockdown according to the YouGov data.  Author provided  Low SES men are one of the highest risk groups for completed suicide attempts. The relatively good mental health outcomes for this group during lockdown could provide one explanation for the somewhat unexpected reduction in suicides that has been seen in some countries during the pandemic.  Search data also highlights a potential link between income support and suicide rates. The figure below shows international search trends for suicidal ideation over the pandemic-lockdown period. India and South Africa, two countries that implemented lockdowns with minimal social support mechanisms, are clear outliers, with sharply rising rates of suicidal ideation.

Jewish and KKK â¦ Red Necks are the KKK and Jewish people are the Law â¦ Work that out.  This was one of the weirder recent tweets from the grime artist Wiley which caused outrage and resulted in a Twitter boycott by many Jewish users and their supporters. Wiley has subsequently been deleted from Twitter, Facebook and Instagram and dropped by his management.  But what is going on here? We certainly do need to work out why such bizarre antisemitism seems to be the soundtrack of our abnormal times, from the 2008 recession and subsequent austerity to COVID-19. This is not simply about Wiley having a meltdown in the twilight of his career.  Antisemitism is never just about individuals (however obnoxious). That lets the wider culture off the hook. Wileyâs conspiracy theory is his alone but is no more unusual than those who believe that âJewish peopleâ caused COVID-19 or were responsible for 9/11 â not to mention the police treatment of African-Americans and the global recession. The more common version of Wileyâs conspiracy, by white supremacists, is that Jews are the âhidden handâ causing people of colour to immigrate and adulterate the âwhiteâ race. Such thinking led to the 2018 attack on a Synagogue in Pittsburgh where 11 congregants were shot dead and six were severely injured.  Antisemitism and anti-racism  But Wiley is an anti-racist black-British activist. How is it possible to speak of him in the same breath as the Pittsburgh shooter? One other tweet by Wiley gives us a hint:  I donât care about Hitler, I care about black people.  The idea that the second world war was âwhite on whiteâ violence and had nothing to do with black people has long since been debunked. Hitlerâs racism obviously encompassed people of colour and many people of colour from the colonies fought against Nazism â most famously the anti-colonial leader, Frantz Fanon. Hitlerâs outlook was imperial as well as antisemitic as he wanted to colonise the European continent so that large parts of the continent would be used for slave labour.  The main reason why antisemitism is so insidious is that it encompasses all political persuasions and can assume a mild or extreme form and all varieties in between. It is a racial rhetoric that brings together black radicals and white supremacists as well as the left of left-wing parties and the right of right-wing parties.  In short, if you believe that mainstream liberal democracy (or neo-liberalism if you are left wing) has failed society, then âthe Jewsâ become an easy target. Since the Holocaust, Jewish communities have, for the most part, thrived in western Europe and the United States. Their numbers might be tiny (0.2% of the global population) but a regional power, the State of Israel, claims their adherence. If you are against colonialism and/or banking monopolies, then evoking âthe Jewsâ â âinternational zionismâ or âGeorge Sorosâ or âthe Rothschildsâ â is a handy dog whistle to indicate how radical you are. Naming Jews as a symbol of the broken mainstream indicates that you intend to challenge conventional liberalism in the name of revolutionary socialism or laissez-faire capitalism.  Debates about whether ethno-racial minorities will harm or help the nation-state are, above all, political. Jews have been conventionally perceived in Britain as both a bastion of empire and one of the main threats to empire; as prefiguring a socialist world order and as a key force preventing its development; as the ideal economic man and the degenerate plutocrat.  PA/ Jonathan Brady  Such debates about whether ambivalent Jews are âgoodâ or âbadâ are centuries old. Since the Holocaust, when more than a third of all Jews were murdered, Jews have become widely accepted as the world historical victim. But many of those who want a monument to slavery in Britain, the historical centre of the slave trade, do not understand why a Holocaust memorial is currently the governmentâs first priority. It is as if Jewish victimhood is being used to write out black victimhood closer to home. That is why Wiley does not âcare about Hitlerâ and why there was once a perverse competition in Jeremy Corbynâs Labour Party between different histories of oppression. Many Corbyn supporters see Jews as too powerful or too âwhiteâ to be victims so donât see antisemitism as racism. Diaspora Jewish victimhood, in this narrative, was deemed to write out the history of Palestinian suffering.  All anti-racist activists want to make connections between victimised groups. The history of Jews becoming âwhiteâ and âgood citizensâ is a bittersweet process that Muslims in Europe and the United States are currently going through. Impoverished African-American ghettos speak to the singular experience of white ethnics (Jewish, Irish, Italian, Hispanic) who, unlike their black counterparts, were allowed to leave their ghettos for the suburbs. The reason that we should all âcare about Hitlerâ is that anti-racism is indivisible. Wileyâs rant demonstrates that focusing only on one history of oppression, at the expense of another, counts for nothing.",https://theconversation.com/i-dont-care-about-hitler-wiley-and-the-rise-of-antisemitism-143578,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,6ca942fd2b2cdcc64dce2cca4ebf1fec8c8a42895571c91dfcf1dc0fce8c956f,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

In close succession, three spacecraft will arrive at the planet, joining the dozen or so craft already circling Mars. Two of the spacecraft were launched in the past couple of weeks by newcomers to martian exploration: the United Arab Emiratesâ Al-Amal (meaning Hope) and Chinaâs Tianwen-1 (which means Question to Heaven).  The third vessel will be NASAâs Mars 2020, containing the Perseverance rover, which just took off successfully from Florida. While this rover will be just one of many on the red planet, it is our best bet for finding life there for the time being.  The sudden flurry of activity is a result of planetary dynamics: every two or so years, the orbits of Earth and Mars align so that the two bodies are at their closest to each other. This results in a shorter interplanetary transit time, of just over six months. The next such launch window will not be until 2022 â when it is expected that the European Space Agencyâs ExoMars 2022 will join the throng.  Read more: Decades of attempts show how hard it is to land on Mars â here's how we plan to succeed in 2021  It is legitimate to question why we keep sending rockets to Mars. Surely we have acquired enough images of the surface and its landscapes to know that water used to be there, but has now vanished? True enough â but there are still mysteries to solve: when did the water go, and why? And, of course, the biggest question of all: is (or was) there life on Mars?  The three missions have different objectives: Hope will orbit the planet for at least two Earth years (one Martian year), acquiring data on Marsâ weather â just like the weather satellites orbiting Earth. Tianwen-1 will orbit Mars and is carrying a rover that will be parachuted down to the surface at Utopia Planitia, where it will analyse the soil and take images of the surface.  Perseverance will arrive almost at the same time â but a couple of thousand kilometres away in Jezero Crater. It will be deposited on the surface by sky-crane technology (see the video below), the same method that delivered Curiosity so successfully in 2012.  Perseverance carries a full complement of scientific instruments that will measure all the usual things that get measured on Mars: the chemistry and mineralogy of the rocks and soil, the amount and type or organic material present at and just below the surface, and so on. But there are two other features of the mission that make it unique.  First of all is the helicopter/drone â called Ingenuity - that will be released from beneath the rover. This will fly from Perseverance and circle around before landing away from the rover. It is not certain what the range of the drone will be â although the flight will only last a few minutes and Ingenuity will land only a few metres away from the rover.  The idea behind the flight is to test the concept of atmospheric flight on Mars. Eventually, it is anticipated, drones will be able to fly for much longer and for greater distances. This could help guide rovers, identifying features worth investigating and hazards to avoid.  NASA/JPL-Caltech  The second unique feature is a drilling and caching system. Perseverance is the first rover to have the capability to drill a core, about ten centimetres long and one centimetre in diameter, and extract it intact from the drill hole. Perseverance will take samples from a range of different rock types as it traverses the crater floor. The drill cores will be left in a small pile - a cache â for collection, possibly in early 2027, and subsequent transport back to Earth (estimated arrival time is still not known, but maybe around spring 2032).  Sample return  Why is it so important to bring samples back from Mars? The instruments carried by Perseverance will be able to undertake fairly sophisticated chemical analyses of the rocks and soil. But even though the instruments and measurements are a tremendous achievement, they do not have the full range of equipment that we employ on Earth to squeeze every drop of information from a rock.  Tests to check for organic compounds â and whether they might have a biological origin â require a chain of different analyses that are far too elaborate and complex to be undertaken on Mars. Boiling acids, alcohol rinses, addition of chemicals, subtraction of solids, are steps in the chemistry needed to extract and separate organic molecules from their rocky hosts. This just cannot (as yet) be done on Mars.  The rocks will be weighed and measured practically on a grain-by-grain basis and analysed, in some cases down to the individual atoms from which the material is composed. This will be an international effort â there is already a multi-national panel (called MSPG-2) which will draft the requirements for the first sets of analyses and how the samples will be stored, curated and subsequently distributed to the wider scientific community.  There is another set of reasons to bring samples back from Mars â the future of human exploration of Mars. If we send humans to Mars, we have to know how to bring them back again. We have not returned anything directly from another planetary body since the Apollo 17 astronauts left the Moon in December 1972. Yes, we have captured bits from a comet and an asteroid and returned them to Earth â but those missions did not land, collect and come back.  We have been investigating Mars for a long time: for over 150 years by telescope, 50 years from orbit and 20 years by rovers. Only another 12 years, then, before we can analyse Mars in our own laboratories.  Perseverance to get things done is a gift of humanity. Hereâs hoping that the rover will live up to its name.",https://theconversation.com/mars-2020-the-hunt-for-life-on-the-red-planet-is-about-to-get-serious-143698,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,65989035821df5b767c541a1275be64115b28ecbfaae2dc43e21faf527402c45,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:57.832960,2020-07-30T12:02:22Z,Autonomous cars: five reasons they still arenât on our roads,"Elon Musk thinks his company Tesla will have fully autonomous cars ready by the end of 2020. âThere are no fundamental challenges remaining,â he said recently. âThere are many small problems. And then thereâs the challenge of solving all those small problems and putting the whole system together.â  While the technology to enable a car to complete a journey without human input (what the industry calls âlevel 5 autonomyâ) might be advancing rapidly, producing a vehicle that can do so safely and legally is another matter.  Read more: Are self-driving cars safe? Expert on how we will drive in the future  There are indeed still fundamental challenges to the safe introduction of fully autonomous cars, and we have to overcome them before we see these vehicles on our roads. Here are five of the biggest remaining obstacles.  1. Sensors  Autonomous cars use a broad set of sensors to âseeâ the environment around them, helping to detect objects such as pedestrians, other vehicles and road signs. Cameras help the car to view objects. Lidar uses lasers to measure the distance between objects and the vehicle. Radar detects objects and tracks their speed and direction.  These sensors all feed data back to the carâs control system or computer to help it make decisions about where to steer or when to brake. A fully autonomous car needs a set of sensors that accurately detect objects, distance, speed and so on under all conditions and environments, without a human needing to intervene.  Lousy weather, heavy traffic, roads signs with graffiti on them can all negatively impact the accuracy of sensing capability. Radar, which Tesla uses, is less susceptible to adverse weather conditions, but challenges remain in ensuring that the chosen sensors used in a fully autonomous car can detect all objects with the required level of certainty for them to be safe.  To enable truly autonomous cars, these sensors have to work in all weather conditions anywhere on the planet, from Alaska to Zanzibar and in congested cities such as Cairo and Hanoi. Accidents with Teslaâs current (only level 2) âautopilotâ, including one in July 2020 hitting parked vehicles, show the company has a big gap to overcome to produce such a global, all-weather capability.  2. Machine learning  Most autonomous vehicles will use artificial intelligence and machine learning to process the data that comes from its sensors and to help make the decisions about its next actions. These algorithms will help identify the objects detected by the sensors and classify them, according to the systemâs training, as a pedestrian, a street light, and so on. The car will then use this information to help decide whether the car needs to take action, such as braking or swerving, to avoid a detected object.  In the future, machines will be able to do this detection and classification more efficiently than a human driver can. But at the moment there is no widely accepted and agreed basis for ensuring that the machine learning algorithms used in the cars are safe. We do not have agreement across the industry, or across standardisation bodies, on how machine learning should be trained, tested or validated.  3. The open road  Once an autonomous car is on the road it will continue to learn. It will drive on new roads, detect objects it hasnât come across in its training, and be subject to software updates.  How can we ensure that the system continues to be just as safe as its previous version? We need to be able to show that any new learning is safe and that the system doesnât forget previously safe behaviours, something the industry has yet to reach agreement on.  4. Regulation  Sufficient standards and regulations for a whole autonomous system do not exist - in any industry. Current standards for the safety of existing vehicles assume the presence of a human driver to take over in an emergency.  For self-driving cars, there are emerging regulations for particular functions, such as for automated lane keeping systems. There is also an international standard for autonomous systems that includes autonomous vehicles, which sets relevant requirements but does not solve the problems of sensors, machine learning and operational learning introduced above - although it may in time.  Without recognised regulations and standards, no self-driving car, whether considered to be safe or not, will make it on to the open road.  5. Social acceptability  There have been numerous high-profile accidents involving Teslaâs current automated cars, as well as with other automated and autonomous vehicles. Social acceptability is not just an issue for those wishing to buy a self-driving car, but also for others sharing the road with them.  The public needs to be involved in decisions about the introduction and adoption of self-driving vehicles. Without this, we risk the rejection of this technology.  The first three of these challenges must be solved to help us overcome the latter two. There is, of course, a race to be the first company to introduce a fully self-driving car. But without collaboration on how we make the car safe, provide evidence of that safety, and work with regulators and the public to get a âstamp of approvalâ these cars will remain on the test track for years to come.  Unpalatable as it may be to entrepreneurs such as Musk, the road to getting autonomous vehicles approved is through lengthy collaboration on these hard problems around safety, assurance, regulation and acceptance.",https://theconversation.com/autonomous-cars-five-reasons-they-still-arent-on-our-roads-143316,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,4d6685b59d0396e11fe08e3afd2fcd3441d5ed0ca801f860ffad90a6d538a1ab,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:22:59.085221,2020-07-30T11:08:26Z,Are young trees or old forests more important for slowing climate change?,"Forests are thought to be crucial in the fight against climate change â and with good reason. Weâve known for a long time that the extra COâ humans are putting in the atmosphere makes trees grow faster, taking a large portion of that COâ back out of the atmosphere and storing it in wood and soils.  But a recent finding that the worldâs forests are on average getting âshorter and youngerâ could imply that the opposite is happening. Adding further confusion, another study recently found that young forests take up more COâ globally than older forests, perhaps suggesting that new trees planted today could offset our carbon sins more effectively than ancient woodland.  How does a world in which forests are getting younger and shorter fit with one where they are also growing faster and taking up more COâ? Are old or young forests more important for slowing climate change? We can answer these questions by thinking about the lifecycle of forest patches, the proportion of them of different ages and how they all respond to a changing environment.  Read more: Using forests to manage carbon: a heated debate  The forest carbon budget  Letâs start by imagining the world before humans began clearing forests and burning fossil fuels.  In this world, trees that begin growing on open patches of ground grow relatively rapidly for their first several decades. The less successful trees are crowded out and die, but thereâs much more growth than death overall, so there is a net removal of COâ from the atmosphere, locked away in new wood.  As trees get large two things generally happen. One, they become more vulnerable to other causes of death, such as storms, drought or lightning. Two, they may start to run out of nutrients or get too tall to transport water efficiently. As a result, their net uptake of COâ slows down and can approach zero.  Eventually, our patch of trees is disturbed by some big event, like a landslide or fire, killing the trees and opening space for the whole process to start again. The carbon in the dead trees is gradually returned to the atmosphere as they decompose.  The vast majority of the carbon is held in the patches of big, old trees. But in this pre-industrial world, the ability of these patches to continue taking up more carbon is weak. Most of the ongoing uptake is concentrated in the younger patches and is balanced by COâ losses from disturbed patches. The forest is carbon neutral.  Now enter humans. The world today has a greater area of young patches of forest than we would naturally expect because historically, we have harvested forests for wood, or converted them to farmland, before allowing them to revert back to forest. Those clearances and harvests of old forests released a lot of COâ, but when they are allowed to regrow, the resulting young and relatively short forest will continue to remove COâ from the atmosphere until it regains its neutral state. In effect, we forced the forest to lend some COâ to the atmosphere and the atmosphere will eventually repay that debt, but not a molecule more.  But adding extra COâ into the atmosphere, as humans have done so recklessly since the dawn of the industrial revolution, changes the total amount of capital in the system.  And the forest has been taking its share of that capital. We know from controlled experiments that higher atmospheric COâ levels enable trees to grow faster. The extent to which the full effect is realised in real forests varies. But computer models and observations agree that faster tree growth due to elevated COâ in the atmosphere is currently causing a large carbon uptake. So, more COâ in the atmosphere is causing both young and old patches of forest to take up COâ, and this uptake is larger than that caused by previously felled forests regrowing.  The effect of climate change  But the implications of climate change are quite different. All else being equal, warming tends to increase the likelihood of death among trees, from drought, wildfire or insect outbreaks. This will lower the average age of trees as we move into the future. But, in this case, that younger age does not have a loan-like effect on COâ. Those young patches of trees may take up COâ more strongly than the older patches they replace, but this is more than countered by the increased rate of death. The capacity of the forest to store carbon has been reduced. Rather than the forest loaning COâ to the atmosphere, itâs been forced to make a donation.  So increased tree growth from COâ and increased death from warming are in competition. In the tropics at least, increased growth is still outstripping increased mortality, meaning that these forests continue to take up huge amounts of carbon. But the gap is narrowing. If that uptake continues to slow, it would mean more of our COâ emissions stay in the atmosphere, accelerating climate change.  Overall, both young and old forests play important roles in slowing climate change. Both are taking up COâ, primarily because there is more COâ about. Young forests take up a bit more, but this is largely an accident of history. The extra carbon uptake we get from having a relatively youthful forest will diminish as that forest ages. We can plant new forests to try to generate further uptake, but space is limited.  But itâs important to separate the question of uptake from that of storage. The worldâs big, old forests store an enormous amount of carbon, keeping it out of the atmosphere, and will continue to do so, even if their net COâ uptake decreases. So long as they are not cut down or burned to ashes, that is.",https://theconversation.com/are-young-trees-or-old-forests-more-important-for-slowing-climate-change-139813,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,ca218240e3ec9a9ec3acdb77614d4f344be344afb765fd1b2f53885b1a9f3716,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906
2020-08-06 13:23:00.348183,2020-07-30T10:58:00Z,Many writers say they can actually hear the voices of their characters â hereâs why,"Many famous writers claim itâs the characters who actually drive the plot, create the dialogue, and essentially âdo their own thingâ in the novels they write.  To investigate this phenomenon, we ran a survey at the Edinburgh International Book Festival in 2014 and 2018, asking writers how they experienced their characters. Over 60% of the 181 participants said they heard their charactersâ voices, and over 60% said their characters sometimes acted of their own accord. Some authors even said they could enter into dialogue with their characters and that their characters sometimes âtalked backâ and argued with them.  These writers were often fairly explicit that all of these experiences were imaginary. But writers also talked about being âsurprisedâ by what their characters said and did â even sometimes laughing because of the jokes their characters told. This brings up questions around control and âagencyâ, since these writers did not always feel as if they were consciously deciding what happened in the narrative.  Whoâs talking?  This experience is often explained by the suggestion that writers are somehow special or different, and that their imaginings are more âvividâ or âpowerfulâ. But in our study, there was a much greater degree of variation than such theories account for. Indeed, there was a significant minority of writers who did not report the experience of their characters having agency.  But recent studies on âinner speechâ may help to explain writersâ experiences of their characters in a different way. Inner speech is the inner monologue and or dialogue that most of us have when we think verbally. It can vary a great deal from person to person. For instance, some people are aware of hearing their inner speech most of the time, and some are barely conscious of it at all.  Some people, for example, experience their inner speech more as a monologue, while for others it is more of a dialogue. People can also be aware of having the voices of âother peopleâ in their inner speech â for instance, hearing the voice of one of their parents giving them a piece of advice or criticism.  In much the same way, we might also imagine hearing the voices of other people when we do things like think about how an argument might have gone differently, or how someone we know is likely to respond to the news weâre about to give them.  Itâs not unreasonable then to question the extent to which weâre aware of actually controlling these imaginary versions of real people. After all, the feeling that a friend or family member is more likely to say one thing than another isnât usually something thatâs consciously decided or laboriously worked out through reasoning. Usually itâs immediate and intuitive, at least when we know that person well. And this is different again from simply deciding to imagine them responding the way we want them to.  A matter of contrast  According to this line of thinking, most of us actually have independent and agentive âcharactersâ and hear their voices â itâs just that these characters have the same identities as the people we know in the real world.  Indeed, some of the writers in our survey explicitly compared hearing their characters to the âother peopleâ in their inner speech:  Itâs like when you see a dress in a shop window and you hear your mumâs voice saying âit wonât wash [well]â in your mind. Itâs involuntary but not intrusive.  So perhaps it isnât so much a question of how writers have these experiences of independent characters. Instead, it might be more a question of why the agency of fictional characters is so much more noticeable (and therefore more noteworthy). One possible explanation lies in the way this experience of charactersâ agency relates to other experiences, both real and imaginary.  On the one hand, there is a contrast that emerges because of how the characters develop over time. First, there are the initial stages where the writer consciously determines what the characters do and say. Yet after a certain point, the writerâs greater familiarity with the characters provides the same kind of immediate and intuitive sense of what they would do or say that often applies to our imaginings of real people.  On the other hand, there is a contrast which usually pertains to our imaginings of real people: the contrast between our imaginings of what they will do and what they actually do in the world. But of course, fictional characters do not have a counterpart out there that has conspicuously more independence and agency. In other words, those qualities arenât being constantly âovershadowedâ by the real-life versions.  These theories may go some way towards explaining some of the broader aspects of whatâs going on. Yet the more researchers delve into thought and imagination, the more difficult it is to say exactly how much control over our thoughts and actions any of us actually have â and to what extent the control we feel we have is an illusion.",https://theconversation.com/many-writers-say-they-can-actually-hear-the-voices-of-their-characters-heres-why-139170,http://theconversation.com/uk/articles.atom,d68514bc0d6bcb4815221ee515a3184f2fdefff6bcd66361cdb87457ffebbd81,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Contingent on a favourable weather forecast and a successful final week at the ISS, NASA astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley will begin the undocking procedure on August 1, and re-enter Earthâs atmosphere the next day â a total of 64 days since lift off.  The historic launch took place on May 30 from NASAâs Kennedy Space Center in Florida, marking the first time a commercial space company has carried humans into orbit around Earth. But while the launch was a nail-biting experience to watch, reentry will be even more risky â presenting a tense moment for mission control. SpaceX founder Elon Musk said that the reentry is indeed his âbiggest concernâ.  The joint SpaceX and NASA mission was successful in docking with the ISS, so that astronauts could complete scientific and maintenance work, including four spacewalks.  NASAhandout/EPA  Importantly, the missionâs primary purpose is to test and demonstrate the vehicleâs capability to safely carry crew to and from Earth orbit, as the first step in the plan of commencing regular ISS missions and commercial space flights.  Reentry danger points  The extreme velocities and temperatures the vehicle must endure present a major challenge to engineers and makes reentry the most perilous part of a mission.  The danger starts with finding the right angle of the trajectory as the spacecraft enters the upper atmosphere. If it is too steep, the astronauts will experience potentially fatal g-forces, and the friction of the air drag could cause the spacecraft to explode. If it is too shallow, the capsule will instead catastrophically skip off the atmosphere and back into Earth orbit.  The spacecraft will enter the upper atmosphere at 27,000km/hour. That is 7.5km/second, or more than 20 times the speed of sound. In whichever units you prefer â this is fast. At these velocities, a very strong shock wave forms around the front of the vehicle, compressing and superheating the air. Managing the immense thermal load is a huge reentry engineering challenge.  At the most extreme stage, the temperature of the air in the shock layer exceeds 7,000Â°C. By comparison, the temperature at the surface of the Sun is around 5,500Â°C. This makes the vehicleâs heat shield so hot that it starts to glow â a process called incandescence. SpaceXâs new and advanced PICA-X material heat shield has managed to protect the capsule in test flights, later being recovered in a very charred state.  The air molecules around the vehicle also break down into positively charged atoms and free electrons â a so-called plasma. When some of the molecules recombine, excess energy is released as photons (light particles) â giving the air around the vehicle an amber glow.  This plasma layer may be beautiful, but it can cause radio blackouts. When an electron travels along a conductive wire, we have electricity. Similarly, when free electrons move through the plasma around the vehicle, we have an electric field. If the electric field becomes too strong, it can reflect and attenuate the radiowaves trying to reach the spacecraft.  Blackout not only leads to a loss of connection to on-board crew and flight data, it can also make remote control and guidance impossible. The Apollo missions, the Mars Pathfinder and the recent, failed 2018 Soyuz rocket launch all incurred communications blackout on the order of minutes. NASA mission control are anticipating a nervous six minutes of blackout during the peak heating phase of Crew Dragonâs return â if anything goes wrong during this time, itâs in the hands of the astronauts.  Another risky stage is the parachute-assisted landing. The Crew Dragon will deploy four parachutes upon the final stage of reentry, as the vehicle descends toward a gentle splashdown in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida. This manoeuvre has been tested by SpaceX 27 times prior to next weekâs crewed landing, so it should work.  Future goals  A successful landing will have huge implications â lowering the cost of space exploration through the use of reusable rockets and enabling private space exploration. While SpaceX engineered the Crew Dragon vehicle under contract to NASA, the company is free to use the spacecraft for commercial flights without NASA involvement after operational certification.  SpaceX has a partnership with commercial aerospace company Axiom Space, which has the ultimate goal of building the worldâs first commercial space station. The proposed commercial activities for the station are broad: from in-space research and manufacturing to space exploration support.  Then there is space tourism. Private citizens are already queuing for their ticket to space, and with a successful Crew Dragon splashdown, they wonât be waiting long. American space tourism company, Space Adventures (partnered with SpaceX), are planning to offer zero-gravity atmospheric flights, orbital flights with a spacewalk option and laps of the Moon by late 2021.

2020-08-06 13:23:01.870539,2020-07-30T10:29:02Z,Five top tips for managing your personal finances during coronavirus,"When it comes to money, coronavirus has split the nation. Financial stress dominates for many of the 9.5 million employees on furlough, potentially facing unemployment as the scheme unwinds, and for those whose small businesses have been disrupted or whose finances were already precarious before the crisis. By contrast, if you are one of the lucky ones whose income has been uninterrupted, you may have found that your spending has dropped and, as a result, you might have been able to pay off debts and even build up your savings.  Whichever camp you fall into, here are some ways to weather the pandemic storm and plan for your financial future.  1. Saving  With the Bank of England base rate slashed to 0.1%, the returns on savings accounts are at record lows. But the government needs your money. Pre-coronavirus, National Savings & Investments (NS&I), the UKâs state-owned savings bank, was tasked to raise Â£6 billion in 2020-21 for the government. That has now been hiked to Â£35 billion. To attract your savings, NS&I has some of the best deals, such as 1% per annum on its direct saver account and 1.4% per annum in prizes on premium bonds.  Even with low interest rates, saving still makes sense to provide a buffer against further disruption and emergencies. For longer-term goals, such as pensions, you should consider investments.  2. Investing  For higher returns than savings offer, inevitably you must take on more risk. One option is peer-to-peer investing, where investors are matched directly to borrowers through online platforms, such as Ratesetter and Zopa. Make sure you understand that you could lose money if borrowers default and that peer-to-peer investing is not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (unlike savings accounts).  The stock market fell sharply at the start of the crisis and is largely treading water in the uncertain climate of changing policy announcements and fears of further coronavirus outbreaks. Some see this as an opportunity for stock-picking â always a high-risk activity. Stocks that are âinâ include online businesses and green technology. Those that are âoutâ are high street retailers, airlines and carbon-based industries. Some investors are turning to commodities, including gold, but prices are already high.  In general, profound uncertainty about the economic and inflation outlook makes diversifying your investments across a range of different assets more important than ever.  3. Retirement contributions  The current climate is a perfect storm for pension schemes, suffering low interest rates, the stock market fall and widespread dividend cuts. On top of that, if your budget is currently squeezed, you may feel tempted to opt out of your workplace pension scheme.  Bear in mind, though, that you will lose your employer contributions and tax relief, which in effect double your money from the start, regardless of investment returns. So, try to keep paying in if you can.  4. Borrowing  Payment holidays on mortgages, credit cards and other loans are a welcome source of temporary respite for millions of borrowers. But bear in mind that interest still builds up during the so-called holiday and, when payments restart, they could be higher than before.  Also be aware that, although using a payment-holiday scheme will not be noted on your credit records with credit reference agencies, it may still affect your ability to borrow in future. This is because lenders must carry out affordability checks to make sure you can manage any new borrowing on top of catching up with existing loans once the payment holiday stops.  So only use or extend payment holidays as a last resort. And, if your money problems look like they will be more than temporary, talk to your lender about other options. Consider getting help from one of the free, independent debt advice organisations. You can find one near you via the Money Advice Service.  5. Spending  It is natural to spend less if you are worried about the future. But this creates a classic dilemma, first analysed by economist, John Maynard Keynes, during the 1930s depression: if consumers donât spend, the economy contracts. This results in job losses, falling household incomes and further spending cuts in a damaging downward spiral.  This is why the government announced various incentives in its March budget and the July summer statement. This included VAT cuts for the tourism and hospitality sectors, discounts on eating out, raising the stamp duty threshold on home purchases, a deal for green homes to subsidise the cost of double glazing, insulation and energy-efficient heating, along with an extension of discounts for buying electric cars.  So if your household can afford it, spending will help to support and revive the economy. It will also gain you, for example, up to Â£5,000 off making your home greener and up to Â£3,000 off the purchase of an electric car.  One area of spending that is proving more fraught is holidaying abroad. The recent surprise announcement that tourists returning from Spain will have to self-isolate for 14 days was a sharp reminder that the world is far from getting back to normal.  If you are planning a trip abroad, check carefully what your travel operatorâs policy is in the event of a coronavirus-related cancellation. Also make sure that your travel insurance includes coronavirus cover (many donât) and whether this cover is limited to medical expenses or extends to cancellation as well.

It has emerged it can take an entire week for one care home to input testing information for all its staff on to the UK Governmentâs online portal.  The issue was raised at a virtual meeting of Perth and Kinross Integration Joint Board on Friday, July 31.  Dumped butane cylinder could have killed refuse staff  Gordon Paterson, the chief officer of Perth and Kinross Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP), said that, while testing had initially been a challenge, progress had been made.  He told board members: âWe are now at a position where 60, 70, 80 per cent of all staff in care homes are being tested each week.â  Independent sector improvement lead Lynn Blair paid credit to Perth and Kinross care homes and revealed it was looking like 86 per cent of staff had been tested last week.

But she said the UK Governmentâs online portal was ânot that user-friendlyâ as it took 20 minutes to register test results for each employee.  Ms Blair added: âWe have some care homes that have 97 staff so that takes one member of staff the whole week to do that.â  Films revealed for first ever drive-in experience in town  Councillor Callum Purves, who sits on the board, said the increase in the numbers of staff being regularly tested was a âmarked improvementâ and was âvery reassuringâ.  He said: âI appreciate itâs a burden on care homes and for staff to have to take time out of their day to do that but itâs obviously ensuring we protect the people who are in care homes and the staff themselves.â  After the meeting, the UK Government told the Perthshire Advertiser it is working hard to improve their system and allow care homes to âbulk register tests.â  It has recently written to directors of public health and directors of adult services to update them about bulk registration services.  A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: âWe are doing all we can to support care homes during this unprecedented global pandemic.  âWe launched a Â£600 million Infection Control Fund for care homes, rolled out repeat testing for residents and staff, and we have made available more than 177 million items of PPE for social care providers.  âAs part of our efforts to make the testing process quicker and more accessible, care homes will soon be able to bulk register tests.  âWe have been working with care homes to develop the new tool and guidance will be issued in due course.â  Performer hopes to make Scottish voice heard after starting theatre company  The spokesperson said it had âestablished one of the worldâs largest testing programmes from scratchâ.  They said that, since its launch, 16m tests have been carried out in the UK with the capacity for more than 338,000 tests per day.  They also said testing in care homes is a âcrucial part of our strategy to help prevent and control outbreaks,â and claimed the government had done everything it could to encourage care homes to register to receive test kits.  Hollywood actor Alan Cumming to lead Perthshire Pride celebrations  They said the government contacted every eligible care home in Perth and Kinross and sent out tests unless a care home stated it did not want to receive the test kits.

Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid Email  A devastated Scots schoolgirl has penned an open letter to John Swinney after receiving her exam results claiming she has been penalised for the school she goes to.  Eva Peteranna, 17, says her dreams of being a medic could be at risk after she was given a disappointing set of results.  The schoolgirl attends Sgoil Lionacleit on the island of Benbecula in the Western Isles and had been predicted to achieve three As, a. B and a C in her Highers.  (Image: REUTERS)  But she has instead been given three Bs a D and an F.  She is appealing the grades and has written an emotive letter to the education secretary and the head of education.  https://twitter.com/evapeterannax/status/1291018703807688705  Her letter read: ""Growing up in the islands we were always told that we needed to work harder than those on the mainland if we want to achieve our goals but we should never let it get in the way of where we want to go in life, so as a pupil who has always been determined to go to university and work in my dream job in the medical field, I worked hard.  ""I spent most evenings staying behind after school where possible to make sure I understood everything taught during that day.  ""On August, 4 I received the results given to me by the SQA and to say I am devastated is an understatement.""  (Image: Submitted)  Her letter to Swinney adds: ""... to have my grades knocked down so significantly has not only made me completely reconsider my career path but has also made me lose confidence in myself.  ""The method the SQA has used to moderate results is nothing but unjust and has ended up creating a further divide between those who come from deprived areas and those who are more affluent.""  Eva shared the letter on Twitter, where it has since gone viral picking up nearly 2,000 retweets and 5,600 'likes'.  A major row erupted after results were handed out this year despite exams being cancelled due to lockdown.  Results were issued based on teacher's grading of pupils, then âmoderatedâ by the Scottish Qualifications Authority.  Each school's recent exam performance was also taking into account while grading.  The Higher pass rate for pupils in deprived areas fell by 15.2%. compared to 6.9% in richer areas.  Eva told the Record: ""It was a very strange feeling for me, somehow I still believed that without sitting the exam I would get a fair result.  ""I think I just stared at the text in my phone for a while, every grade in the text took me by surprise and were grades that had never been discussed with me at school! I think I just spent the whole day pretty upset.  ""My family were really disappointed and upset, they know what I deserved and how much I have given up to get where I want to be.""  She added that the letter had initially been a way for her to vent her frustrations.  She added: ""To be totally honest, I wasnât going to send the letter to anyone! I purely wrote it to get my frustrations out. I showed it to my mum when I had finished and she told me to turn it into a letter and send it.  ""I then posted it on twitter for my class mates to see so they knew that someone was trying to get answers for all of us.  ""I absolutely did not expect any sort of reaction, I only posted it for my 30 class mates to see, although I am glad that others in the same position as me have seen it. Hopefully they can feel empowered to write their own letters and feel less alone.  ""All careers in the medical field interest me, unfortunately all of which require high grades which I have not been given.  ""For me the next steps are to appeal three of my results, hopefully that will boost my grades a bit although it still wonât bring me to the level I was expecting and hoping for.""  A Scottish Government spokesman said: âWe are grateful to Eva for her letter and will be in touch with her shortly to respond to her concerns. We would encourage any young person disappointed by their results to speak to their school and use the free appeals process.    âThis year has been exceptionally challenging, and robust processes were developed to allow certification that is fair for all learners.    âThere was a rise in pass rates at National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher and the SQA results show a narrowing of the gap between pupils from the most deprived to the least deprived groupings.â",https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scots-schoolgirl-pens-emotional-open-22478573,https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/?service=rss,f82e148ffe828aa3e6e4c370f08acfe581cd0e403047e1fabdafdea36c83d428,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The new branch in Phoenix Leisure Park is set to open on August 7, making it the fourth Taco Bell to open in Scotland, and only the second in the country with a drive-thru for diners.  Construction on the two-storey restaurant has been in the final stages for a number of weeks, and these exclusive pictures show what Mexican food lovers can expect if they head along to the new diner.  Plans for the food giantâs two-storey eatery were given the green light in 2018 after Renfrewshire Council revealed the proposals in a report and confirmed they had been rubber-stamped.  The report read: âThe site is in a highly accessible location, it is within walking distance of Linwood and the nearby business park, retail park and car showrooms.  âIf planning permission were refused, the operator would not relocate to Paisley or Linwood town centres and would more likely seek to locate to another area, possibly outwith Renfrewshire.â  Fans of Taco Bell will be able to enjoy the classic menu, which will be available both to dine in or takeaway from the 105-seat restaurant located within the retail park.  The restaurant - which is located near the Showcase Cinema, between an Indian restaurant and KFC - will also boast a drive-thru lane, home delivery and click and collect.  It serves a budget range of tacos, burritos, nachos and quesadillas.  Lucy Dee, marketing lead at Taco Bell UK, said: âWeâre really excited to be opening a fourth Taco Bell in Scotland.  âWeâve had our eye on a potential restaurant in Linwood for a while, and we know weâve got plenty of fans in the area who weâre looking forward to welcoming through our doors.â  Raja Adil, chief executive officer of The Adil Group, added: âI am absolutely delighted to land such a great location in Scotland and open our second drive thru at this site.  âIt is very exciting to now be on our fourth restaurant in Scotland and already aiming to open more in Scotland this year.â  Taco Bell opened its first restaurant in California over 50 years ago and serves around 40million diners every week",https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/new-taco-bell-diner-opening-22479401,https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/?service=rss,17feffb88cdf675945f274c643fb09cbb47ee928982e1087e3a579c5fd53e5a4,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid Email  North-east pubs linked to the city's coronavirus outbreak have hit out at health bosses claiming they had 'absolutely no contact' from the NHS despite being named on a covid list.  NHS Grampian released a list of 28 north-east boozers which people with covid-19 are believed to have visited.  But the owners of McNasty's and Stonehaven's Marine Hotel have said health chiefs never told them through the trace and protect system.  (Image: Facebook)  McNasty's said they had closed voluntarily after being contacted by a customer who had tested positive for the virus.  A statement released by McNasty's yesterday reads: ""Following our statement and actions yesterday and in direct response to the announcement of further lockdown measures by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon earlier today, we can confirm at this point after more than 24 hours since closing our doors voluntarily, we STILL have had no contact from NHS Grampian or NHS test and protect.  ""Additionally, later this afternoon NHS Grampian published a comprehensive list of 28 licensed premises and four sporting venues, stating that each were connected to known and detected cases linked to the cluster.  (Image: Google)  ""As responsible owners and licence holders, we have put every possible measure in place to protect our staff and customers accordingly. Therefore, we are most concerned at this stage that there has been absolutely no contact from any of the bodies responsible for tracing and notifying the general public of potential close contact instances.  ""Whilst we hear 'track and trace' procedures are robust and are working, we along with many other venues listed today have not seen this occur inn reality.""  The Granite City was the first area in Scotland to be put back into lockdown following a major outbreak of Covid-19.  A cluster of 79 cases has been connected to the outbreak which emerged when a group visited the city's Hawthorn bar on July 26.  All bars, cafes and restaurants were ordered to shut their doors at 5pm last night and restrictions have been placed on travel and visitors.  Extra police have been put on Aberdeen's streets to enforce the rules.  Robert Lindsay, owner of the Marine Hotel in Stonehaven, also said he had not been contacted.  A statement released on social media read: ""Well, I don't know where to beginâ¦Iâm still no clearer than anyone else (customers, staff, family or friends) as to the Marine Hotel in Stonehavenâs position as a result of the official response to the Covid-19 outbreak that affected Aberdeen.  ""We were not informed that the Marine, obviously outwith the Aberdeen lockdown area, would be on the NHS Grampian list of premises which had Covid-19 contacts, published yesterday afternoon. We had not been informed there had been such a contact, full stop.  ""We have not been advised as to what we should do now. No official has said whether we have done enough to mitigate any potential contact. No one has said if we should stay open or close. That is a ridiculous and worrying situation to be in.  (Image: Daily Record)  ""With this lack of clarity and communication from health and council officials, I feel the only responsible thing for me to do is close the hotel, despite being outside the Scottish Government imposed lockdown zone, until I am given categorical assurances we can open safely for business as normal.  ""I do this with a heavy heart, but my first duty must be the safety of my staff, customers and the public.  ""I believe the Scottish Government has continued to manage the pandemic extremely well. I also realise every new situation, such as the events of yesterday in Aberdeen, is extremely difficult to manage, especially when things are moving so fast.  ""However, you would have thought, knowing that such situations were highly likely to occur, suitable protocols would be in place for a co-ordinated response and clear communication for all parts of our community, including businesses. That did not happen yesterday.  ""After reading the list and attempting to clarify the situation directly with NHS Grampian, I was contacted by Aberdeenshire Council to ask if I knew we were on the list and had anyone been in contact. Yes, I had read that, but NO I had not been contacted. I asked for clarification.  ""I was told the Marine was on that list in error. We even contacted track and trace officials ourselves to corroborate this; they said âwe have no records of any contacts at The Marine Hotelâ.  ""I then obviously needed to post on social media to that effect to inform my customers, staff and other businesses who have shown us huge support during the past three weeks. That support continued yesterday and my staff and I thank everyone so much for this!  ""However, we have subsequently been contacted and advised there might have been a contact at the Marine and that track and trace would be in touch to advise us what further action, if any, we should take.  ""I reiterate we have not been contacted by track and trace to trace any contacts in The Marine or advised we should take any additional measures.  ""We have been asked by Aberdeenshire Council to provide copies of our risk assessment and measures we have in place to protect customers and staff.  ""I can only assume this is to assess whether the measures we have in place are adequate to mitigate any potential risk or need to trace any further contacts.  ""As lockdown was eased we put in place a rigorous schedule of cleaning, maintenance, risk assessment, staff training, physical distancing measures, additional cleaning and personal sanitisation measures.  ""Those of you who have entered our premises will have witnessed the many measures we have in place. There is endless signage guiding customers in the âdo's and dont'sâ, one way systems, spaced out tables, restricted numbers, hand sanitiser, hourly cleaning of all touch points, doors, tills, toilet handles to beer taps, staff wearing masks, one-use menus, plastic glasses, bookings system, no standing in the bar and much much more.  ""We sanitise every table and chair when a customer leaves. Our booking system ensures plenty of time between customers to achieve this and to collect details to assist track and trace.  ""It is ludicrous that after appearing on the list of affected premises, no official word has been given as to when the contact was, how we can help in the tracing effort and what we should do as a business and as individuals. Let's face it, this is what all the guidelines for businesses, households and individuals are in place for.  ""It IS anticipated the virus is all around us and the measures we put in place are to stop the spread. If there was no virus there would be no measures.  ""I know Grampian NHS published what they were given in terms of possible contacts and premises. But for them to be tweeting and messaging on social media requests when we have not even been contacted, puts us in a terrible situation.  ""I sympathise with the government, local authorities and those tasked with delivering the track and trace service and Iâm sure there has to be priorities.

Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid Email  Hundreds of pupils in Stirling may have missed out on online learning over lockdown according to new figures.  Stirling Council said last week it would âaspireâ to provide a Chromebook for all secondary school pupils and pupils in upper primary school by the autumn term.  But Tory politicians are calling for guarantees that all pupils at Stirlingâs schools will have access to online learning before schools return in August - and for comprehensive support to be in place to ensure pupils engage with the digital opportunities available.  Mid Scotland and Fife MSP, Dean Lockhart and Stirling councillor Ross Oxburgh asked the council how many pupils identified as being unable to access learning online.  In April around 590 primary pupils were unable to access digital learning from home - nine per cent of the total primary pupil population of 6548 - and around 150 secondary pupils (2.5 per cent of the secondary pupil population of 5934).  In June the figures were 513 primary pupils (7.8 per cent) and 159 secondary (2.6 per cent).  It also identified that some pupils had either had to share devices or were attempting to access the online learning provision with unsuitable devices such as a phone or an X-box.  Mr Lockhart said: âThe figures speak for themselves. There are hundreds of pupils across the Stirling area who have no or limited access to any online learning.â  Councillor Oxburgh added: âAll parents and pupils need to hear a firm commitment that every pupil will have access to digital learning. This has become a vital part of 21st century education and young people will need every opportunity to catch up after this prolonged closure of schools. We also need to ensure the right support is in place to encourage pupils to make as much use of digital learning as possible.â  The council said last week, however, it had invested in âstate-of-the-art devicesâ to ensure it was prepared to action contingency plans for a blended learning model, with pupils attending school on some days and learning at home on others, should this be required by the Scottish Government.  All young people in S2 and S3 in Stirling schools already have access to a Chromebook as part of a council initiative to supply technology in a rolling programme, which has been in place since the start of 2018/19 session. The council investment has also been supplemented with the Scottish Governmentâs Digital Inclusion Grant.  The local authority will now aim to roll out additional Chromebooks to young people from P6 to S6, but say with the âhuge demandâ for laptops from schools across the UK due to the pandemic, the devices may not all be available for the resumption of school on August 12.  They say, however, this will not have an impact on learning and the education service is âworking hard to have the devices in classrooms as soon as is reasonably practicableâ.  Children and young people convener Councillor Susan McGill said: âThe councilâs successful Chromebook initiative ensured we were a leading light in Scotland for digital learning before the current crisis.  âSince the closure of schools at the start of the pandemic, there has been a focus on increasing levels of digital inclusion to support learning and we have accelerated our plans to roll out these devices across our settings. Our significant investment in this modern, safe and reliable technology shows our commitment to ensuring our children and young people are equipped with the digital tools they need to succeed and achieve their potential.â  Infrastructure work to support a major expansion of digital provision is also said to be underway with all secondary schools upgraded by the end of August, with primary schools to follow shortly afterwards. Specialised support is also planned with the launch of a âone-stop shop learning platformâ that can be accessed by young people, teachers, parents and carers.

The pandemic has put a further pressure on the health board delivering its five-year Â£20.6m savings plan to break even.  NHS Forth Valleyâs finance chief outlined the cost implications of Covid-19 in a report which was scrutinised by members of the board at a virtual meeting last week.  Director of finance Scott Urquhart provided an overview of the financial impact to date and the associated financial risks. His report was discussed at a private virtual board meeting of NHS Forth Valley on Tuesday, July 28.  On March 31, NHS Forth Valleyâs board approved a five-year financial plan which included a savings requirement of Â£20.6 million to break even.  But many of the actions to achieve those savings have had to be paused as a result of the pandemic.  The report revealed: âThe risk on savings delivery directly resulting from Covid-19 delays has been quantified at approximately Â£10m.â  The board is now working on how to progress its savings plan and âre-prioritise new ways of working to introduce efficiencies and improved value across services.â  NHS Forth Valley has submitted its Covid-19 costs to the Scottish Government but has rated the financial implications at the highest level of risk as red.  The report said: âThere is a risk that Covid-19 mobilisation plan costs are not fully funded and that subsequent infection rates will impact on the boardâs ability to meet its financial targets.â  The report also highlighted a risk the âanticipated Scottish Government funding allocations including those required to meet winter pressures, cannot be met in full.â  NHS Forth Valley expects to have the position confirmed in mid September.  The costs for the three-month period from April to June 2020 amount to Â£4.673 million which include costs incurred with testing, staffing, cleaning, equipment, creating additional capacity and cross boundary flow.  In his report, Mr Urquhart said: âExpenditure levels remain under ongoing scrutiny and review and resources require to be used to their maximum potential.â  The board has also begun identifying cost estimates relating to Covid-19 for the remainder of the financial year. It is anticipated the cost will increase if there is a âsignificant resurgenceâ in Covid-19.  A spokesperson for NHS Forth Valley said: âWe have identified additional costs due to the pandemic and we are planning on the basis that these will be funded in full by the Scottish Government.  âWork is also underway to identify additional cost estimates for the remainder of the financial year.â  Click here for more news and sport from the Stirling area.",https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/nhs-forth-valley-left-additional-22479144,https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/?service=rss,5bc10346d7e07f7aa854ee795183091f22d69ededc963373f5299240905400dd,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

M&Coâs chief executive Andy McGeoch said: âIt quickly became clear that the best way to save most jobs and most stores was to enter administration, with a new company acquiring the assets of the old business, and this process has now been finalised.  âCovid has been by far the biggest challenge our family business has faced in almost 60 years, and I am really pleased that we have been able to maintain a presence in over 200 communities.  âCovid-19 means many people donât feel comfortable travelling on public transport or visiting busy city centres and that can be good news for local High Street stores like M&Co. Thatâs why we are looking at ways of working in partnership with other local retailers to highlight the tremendous range of shopping that can be found in communities like this all over the country.  âLocal economies rely to a huge degree on their town centres and we have seen too many High Streets hollowed out by successive shop closures. More and more people are beginning to realise that, if they donât support their town centres, everyoneâs quality of living really takes a hit, so we are proud to be playing a part in the drive to shop locally.  âThe response from our customers during lockdown was phenomenal. We had a steady stream of requests for updates via M&Coâs Facebook pages, with some customers even posting letters through the doors asking when we were reopening. Itâs hugely encouraging to hear our customers say how much they have missed us after months away.â",https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/mco-stores-alexandria-helensburgh-saved-22478919,https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/?service=rss,6c2268c55048ce47c4af2530771173542820b6477394c4ecc348f9dc7b430808,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The 29-year-old covered 300km during the month of July to raise cash and awareness for both Edinburgh Headway Group and Glasgow Childrenâs Hospital.  Alongside former Celtic midfielder Simon Donnelly, the pair were inspired by Simonâs good friend Jackie McNamara after he narrowly survived a potentially fatal brain haemorrhage.  Andy completed two half marathons within the space of three days and a final day 20k walk to complete the gruelling 300km test in time.  And he was boosted by having McNamara complete the final day alongside him and Simon, as they walked from Fir Park in Motherwell to Celtic Park in Glasgow.  Andy said: âIâm pretty glad itâs over to be honest because my legs are shot.  âI had to do two half marathons in three days, a 15k on the Wednesday and then the final 20k on the Friday.  âWe went from Fir Park to Celtic Park partly in memory of Phil OâDonnell, who died far too young, and his son Luke came along as well which was great.  âJackie did the whole 20k which was incredible when you think six months ago he was in a coma.  âWhat a legend he is.  âHe was talking the whole way and heâs so educated about brain injuries now.  âHe told us that the paramedics got to him within five minutes by chance as theyâd been treating another person nearby.  âIf they hadnât been so close he wouldnât have made it.  âIt was so inspiring to walk with him and as well as the money weâve raised, we have really raised awareness of brain injuries which is what we set out to achieve.â  Andy and Simon have already raised around Â£10,000 between them, with donations still pouring in, and will split the funds equally between the two charities.  The determined pair have got their next running challenge lined up already as they take aim at a European event.  Andy said: âPeople asked how we kept going, and I know it sounds cheesy but we genuinely thought of the sick kids in the hospital.  âThe hospital shared some heartbreaking stories with us, so giving up halfway through just wasnât an option.  âIâd never ran a half marathon before, and when I got halfway through the second one I was really struggling.  âBut the kids gave us something extra to focus on and we just kept on going.  âThe support weâve had from everyone has been incredible and the money will help go towards specialist equipment and medicine that the NHS simply cannot afford.  âWeâve got the bug for it now and weâre hoping to do the Rome marathon next year for the same causes.â  - Anyone looking to donate to Andyâs fundraiser can do so at - www.justgiving.com/fundraising/simon-donnelly-300km-challenge-eh",https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/celtic-legend-jackie-mcnamara-helps-22478834,https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/?service=rss,e0575f598f8ca548fa250c0d3551e73d72fb125bfb9aea8a3aa378d8f0992e21,2020-08-06 13:15:10.504906

The News â together with local community and information platform InYourArea.co.uk and our nationwide network of sister newspapers and websites â has teamed up with Clean Up Britain to push for change.  Our campaign has two aims:  â To increase the maximum punishment for littering to a Â£1000 fine or 100 hours of supervised community litter-picking.  â To make it compulsory for local authorities to enforce the law on littering.  We are urging readers to sign our petition, and aim to get 100,000 signatures, so we can lobby Government to bring in legislation. Weâre also calling on councils to make greater use of powers.  Support has come from former Scotland rugby star Kenny Logan and his TV presenter wife Gabby.

The benefit, proposed by the Scottish Government, would give low- income households Â£10 for each child every week.  It was due to start next year but with unemployment in Renfrewshire increasing by 88 per cent since the start of the pandemic in March, anti-poverty activists say local families need the money now.  Dan Lockyer, of Renfrewshire Citizens Advice Bureau, said the organisation has been inundated with calls for help from people who have lost their job and need support to access benefits for the first time.  âWe would be very keen to see the Child Payment introduced as soon as possible,â Dan told the Express.  âWe support all measures that reduce child poverty levels, which have been growing in Renfrewshire for years, particularly as a result of welfare reform.  âUK child poverty levels were recorded at 30 per cent of children a year ago and 44 per cent of children in lone parent families.  âWe wonât get figures which cover the current crisis until next year, but we are certain that the figure for Renfrewshire has significantly increased with the staggering increase in Universal Credit applications for this area, and growing redundancy and unemployment.â  Calls to introduce the Scottish Social Security benefit immediately have also been made by the child poverty charity, Joseph Rowntree Foundation.  It has urged the government to bring forward feasible options to pay Â£10 per week to each eligible child for a six-month period to help families pull through the economic storm.  The Children and Young Peopleâs Commissioner Bruce Adamson has also urged ministers to tackle food insecurity with the Child Payment, or a single Â£20 per week payment for low-income families until the benefit can be introduced.  Neil Bibby, MSP for West Scotland said the payment was urgently needed to allow those who have lost their jobs are able to feed their families.  The Labour politician said: âMore and more families across Scotland are facing financial hardship, but the SNP government are failing to provide  the direct and immediate support needed.  âWhile the forthcoming Scottish Child Payment has been welcomed, it will not start to reach families until 2021, but so many families need help right now.
